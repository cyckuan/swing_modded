MENNINGER CLINIC WEIGHS SHUTTING DOWN ITS TOPEKA CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world-renowned Menninger Clinic is considering closing its
spacious Topeka, Kan., campus as it struggles to reverse financial
losses, President and Chief Executive Officer W. Walter Menninger
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger, a psychiatrist and the third generation in his family
to lead the mental-health facility, said the clinic was ``looking
at every potential option. We know that the campus is expensive for
us to operate when we maintain the full scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants from Ernst &AMP; Young are conducting a study, expected
to be completed this summer, on how to turn around the fortunes of
the clinic that gained fame treating the mental illnesses of
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger emphasized that no final decision had been made on the
future of the Topeka campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to imagine that there won't be some presence
(by Menninger on the campus), but I feel obligated, in terms of the
institution going forward, to be totally open-minded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Menninger Clinic reported a deficit of $2.9 million in
fiscal year 1999. In the first half of fiscal year 2000, from July
through December of 1999, the deficit totaled $1.2 million,
Menninger said, adding that the losses would have been worse
without financial help from the Menninger Foundation and other
sources of support.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic cut about 140 positions, more than half by attrition,
and demolished several older buildings on the campus last year.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic's financial problems are occurring as mental health
facilities around the country are suffering from shorter inpatient
stays, partly due to tighter reimbursements from managed-care
companies and government health programs. An inpatient is someone
who stays in a hospital or clinic for at least 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, modern medications have lessened the need for long
inpatient stays in psychiatric facilities. The result is that
psychiatric hospitals have been closing in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger said it was too early to speculate on the possibility
of layoffs in connection with the evaluation. The Menninger Clinic
has 1,054 full- and part-time employees in Topeka, more than 800 of
whom work on the main campus. It has 338 employees, both full- and
part-time, in the Kansas City area. It also has subsidiary
operations in the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is painful,'' Menninger said. ``We're having to change
how we practice. We're having to do things differently. If there
are programs that don't make sense, we will have to visit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Health-care consultant Gail Shafton, president of Cue Resources
Inc. in Overland Park, Kan., said the uncertainty facing the
Menninger clinic came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inpatient care is just not the norm anymore for anything in
medicine, and mental health has not been any different,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And although efforts are under way to give mental health
benefits equal status with other health benefits, those efforts
will not reverse the trend toward shorter stays for those receiving
mental health care. Even wealthy people who can afford long stays
for psychiatric care are seeking other alternatives, Shafton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's especially true of baby boomers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to vacate the campus would signify a radical change
for the Menninger Clinic, which was founded by C.F. Menninger and
two of his sons, Will and Karl, in a nearby farmhouse in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Together they set out to treat mental illness with
missionary-like zeal. The world's top psychiatrists flocked there
to work and learn. Movie stars such as actress Gene Tierney fled
Hollywood's glitter to find refuge there.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, celebrities such as Green Bay Packers
quarterback Brett Favre have gone to the Menninger Clinic for help
in solving substance abuse and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic has been consistently ranked as one of the nation's
top two psychiatric care providers in surveys of America's best
hospitals by U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger's main campus consists of 242 acres that unfold along
a quiet hilltop in northwest Topeka. The administration building,
with its imposing clock tower, was modeled after Philadelphia's
Independence Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic also owns 233 acres nearby to the west. It is selling
60 acres on the south end of the campus to the Security Benefit
Group of Companies. A separate 50-acre parcel is being developed
into an office park.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of patients. Menninger said the clinic had
2,238 admissions to its main hospital on the Topeka campus in 1999,
up from 740 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But over that same period, the average length of stay for each
patient declined from 74.3 days to 20.4 days, Menninger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to look at everything in terms of revenue and
expense, and how we can best fulfill our mission, which has had a
traditional commitment to patient care, professional education,
research and prevention,'' Menninger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Menninger Clinic has been branching out from the Topeka
campus in recent years, in response to changes in patient needs and
health-care reimbursements. In the Kansas City area it operates
inpatient psychiatric facilities at four hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Menninger operates a substance-abuse center in Overland Park. It
is a partner in New Directions Behavioral Health, which provides
employee assistance services and managed behavioral health care,
with Health Midwest and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   As for how the ongoing evaluation might affect Kansas City area
operations, Menninger said: ``We're looking at everything. We're
looking at wherever we are to see how that fits into the
equation.''

INDIANA COMPANY MOVES OPERATION, WORKERS TO MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Products and Services, which acquired Guy's Foods last
month, announced Monday that it would close its Fort Wayne, Ind.,
snack food factory and consolidate the operation with the Guy's
plant in Liberty, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to add 50 to 60 jobs at the Liberty plant,
which once employed 1,000 workers and now employs about 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will mean more jobs and about 40 percent more
production,'' said Ron Hirasawa, chairman and chief executive
officer of General Products. ``It will probably mean savings of $5
million a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the Fort Wayne plant will throw 110 hourly and
salaried employees out of work. Hirasawa said key management
personnel would be offered jobs in Liberty after the plant's
scheduled closing on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Wayne plant was built in 1964 and occupies 145,000
square feet. The sprawling Liberty complex was built in different
phases beginning in 1970 and takes up 325,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an efficiency and cost standpoint, it didn't make sense
to have two manufacturing plants,'' said Gary Crutcher, director of
human resources at Guy's. ``The one in Liberty is larger, has more
capacity and can handle the volume better than the plant in Fort
Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy's and General Products both make salty snack foods,
including potato chips, corn chips, tortilla chips, pretzels,
cheese twists and popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Family Snacks Inc., which operates Guy's, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection Feb. 14 after losing $5.75 million over the
previous 16 months. The filing gave Guy's a respite from creditors
as it sought a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   General Products received bankruptcy court approval last month
to acquire the assets of Guy's Foods after outbidding several other
businesses. The Indiana company agreed to assume $14 million in
Guy's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Guy's Acquisition Co. LLC, which was set up by General Products
to buy the assets, will be merged with General Products at the end
of the month. The merged company will be known as General Products
&AMP; Services LLC.
</P>
<P>
   The Guy's brand name, as well as the Seyfert's and Ultima Foods
names of General Products, will be retained, Crutcher said. General
Products also will continue making private-label products.
</P>
<P>
   Guy's is thought to have generated $125 million in sales in
1999. General Products, also a closely held company, is thought to
have generated about $40 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   General Products resulted from the merger last year of
66-year-old Seyfert's Foods of Fort Wayne and Ultima Foods of
Chicago. Like Guy's, Seyfert's at one time was owned by dairy giant
Borden Inc., which shed its snack food units in the mid-1990s to
concentrate on its core business.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Guy's executives purchased Guy's from Borden in 1994
for an undisclosed price. The group was led by Victor R. Sabatino,
who was dismissed as president and chief executive officer of Guy's
last month after the sale to General Products.

PATAKIS REPORT BIG GAIN IN INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and his wife, Libby, reported
earning a record family income of $400,266 in 1999, a 62 percent
increase from the year before, according to a copy of their tax
return made public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's salary remained the same at $177,984, and his income
from outside speaking engagements dropped to $48,000 for three
speeches. In 1998, he got $50,000 for three speeches and $24,000
for his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Pataki's income rose to $190,000 last year from two
consulting jobs. She made a total of $100,000 from her consulting
job with Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir and champion of
conservative causes, a 25 percent raise over 1998. Michael McKeon,
a spokesman for the governor, said Mrs. Pataki was advising Lauder
on the expansion of his television broadcasting business in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   She made $90,000 from her second consulting job, with Premier
Heart, a medical products company based in Port Washington, N.Y.,
that she joined at the end of 1998. McKeon said Mrs. Pataki spoke
to groups outside New York to promote the company's products.
McKeon said he did not know how many hours she worked at either
job.
</P>
<P>
   The Patakis' total income was the highest that they have
reported, and it puts them in the same income range as two other
first couples. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City and his
wife, Donna Hanover, a television journalist, reported $413,155
last year, and President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
reported making $416,039.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue was paid $143,985, which was her main
source of income, according to a copy of her tax return that was
also released on Tuesday. She filed as head of household, and a
spokesman confirmed that she was divorced last year. She also
received $10,990 in rent from a condominium in Mashpee, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Patakis and their four children live in a 24-room Victorian
mansion in Garrison, N.Y., and received rental payments last year
from two properties: $12,850 from the governor's childhood home in
Peekskill, N.Y., and $1,000 from a working farm in Salem, N.Y.
After mortgages, taxes and other costs were factored in, both
rental properties were reported as losses againsttaxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his wife still owed $29,324 in federal income tax _
primarily because of the jump in income _ for a total of $110,908
last year. They were assessed $20,905 in state income tax and
overpaid by $2,897, which will be applied as a credit to next
year's tax. They paid $31,605 in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Their tax return also shows that they spent $3,671 for a
part-time housekeeper last year and donated $4,238 to charities.

KILLINGS OF LIVERY DRIVERS RISE, BUT NOT ROBBERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Obscured by the public outcry over the killings of
livery-cab drivers, and by the city's actions to protect them, lies
a curious fact. While the pace of driver homicides has been rising,
the larger crime pattern, which shows the number of reported
robberies in livery cabs, has not changed, according to police
data.
</P>
<P>
   Seven livery-cab drivers have been killed so far this year, and
five of the slayings bear striking similarities, involving drivers
riding in the darkness with passengers and being shot from behind.
Eleven drivers were killed in all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the police and Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York
State Federation of Cab Drivers, said on Tuesday that the spike in
killings was puzzling because the homicides appeared to have
resulted primarily from robberies spinning out of control, leaving
drivers dead, yet the rate of robberies was not rising on a
statistically significant scale.
</P>
<P>
   Livery-cab drivers reported 269 robberies, including those
committed during the killings, through April 10 of this year, while
261 were reported during the same period in 1999. For the last
three years, the number of livery-cab robberies has been almost
constant, wedged in a narrow band between 966 and 978.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo attributed the increase in homicides to emboldened
criminals, whom he said can sense that street officers have become
restrained, even hesitant, in the aftermath of the widely
publicized police killings of unarmed black men, from Amadou Diallo
last year to Patrick M. Dorismond last month. ! He also said the
numbers compiled by the police might not accurately reflect the
degree of violence, because many drivers do not report hold-ups in
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livery drivers stopped reporting the robberies because they
find that it is a waste od their time,'' he said. ``They ent up
sitting in a precinct or a courtroom, but almost never are the
cases cracked. When they get robbed, they go home and sob a bit and
go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they could not readily explain the rise in
killings. None appear to have been committed by the same person,
said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman, or tied to any other
criminal activity, like a gang initiation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police and the drivers are at a loss to explain the
increase in slayings, they agree on one thing: the killings have
given the livery-cab drivers, who are primarily Hispanic, political
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pushed the Taxi and Limousine
Commission to require livery-cab drivers to install security
cameras or bulletproof partitions in their cars, and the Police
Department has rolled out initiatives, involving more than 300
officers and scores of detectives, to deter the criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the drivers' list of 26 demands to improve safety has
been circulated among the city's news media, and some of the steps,
including joint news conferences to deter criminals and pledges to
increase officer training, have become elements of the city's
safety program.
</P>
<P>
   But while the police and the drivers are cooperating on many
measures, one Police Department recommendation remains contentious.
The police have asked the drivers to comply with Taxi and Limousine
Commission regulations that forbid them to pick up customers from
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman, said 82 percent of the
livery-cab robberies this year, and six of the seven homicides,
occurred after drivers had picked up street hails.
</P>
<P>
   But Mateo said that even with the current concerns, the drivers
would be unlikely to comply with the rules. ``These drivers are
trying to put food on the table for their families,'' he said.
``When they see a fare with $5, they're going to stop.''

COMMENTARY: NEVER ON SUNDAY, MONDAY OR ... 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th and 18th grafs for wording changes)  By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We're trapped in the windmills of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the Elian case hinges on Janet Reno's inner
conflicts, her Waco flashbacks, and her post-traumatic-stress
syndrome from the Miami riots during her time as prosecutor there.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, she gave in to her macho FBI guys and moved too soon,
too forcefully. So in Miami, she calls the shots and doesn't move
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The harder the attorney general tries to come to the rescue, the
more elusive the rescue becomes. The more compassionate she is, the
more endangered the object of her compassion. The tougher she
talks, the deeper the other side digs in.
</P>
<P>
   You can feel her loneliness. She's the president's least
favorite Cabinet member, charged with trying to enforce the law in
an administration that so artfully skirts it.
</P>
<P>
   As in Waco, Bill Clinton is ducking behind the tall gal. He
could end the Elian muddle by simply picking up the phone. Instead
of partying and panhandling in Hollywood, he could grab the chance
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady casts herself as a defender of children. But
she's too busy actualizing her self-worth in New York to worry
about a real child's psyche being razed by a vengeful village.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Al Gore has outpandered even himself, he's lost
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Reno gets easily intimidated by worst-case scenarios. Highlight
reels of her disasters play in her head in an endless loop,
negating every option.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to take Elian out of the house at night
because it would look heavy-handed. She does not want to take Elian
during the day or on weekends because the crowds would be too
boisterous. She does not want to take him in the rain, because he
would get wet. She does not want to take Elian at Miami's rush
hour, Marisleysis' medication hour or Uncle Lazaro's happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian over Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Or in January because she was hoping his Cuban grandmothers could
reclaim him. Or in February because she wanted to let the Miami
relatives have their day in court.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian in March because the Little
Havana crowds were getting unruly and she did not want to provoke
another riot. Even when Lazaro gave Diane Sawyer temporary custody
of Elian, Reno resisted the notion that the uncle might be
exploiting the boy.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian in early April, because she
assumed Lazaro would hand the 6-year-old over voluntarily to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian last Wednesday night, when she
met with the boy and his relatives at the nun's house in Miami
Beach, because she had given her word that she would wait for a
negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian on Thursday, after the relatives
broke their word and scorned the 2 p.m. federal deadline to turn
him over, because she wanted the scofflaws to have another day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian in the furious aftermath of the
coco loco family giving TV the ``Papa don't preach'' videotape _
widely deemed abusive _ because she said she never saw the tape.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian on Sunday, after lawyers for the
Miami relatives demonized the boy's father with unsubstantiated
smears, because she was still waiting for the appeals court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian after ``60 Minutes,'' on which
Dan Rather gave the father a ``man-to-man'' challenge to weep over
the hostage videotape, because she was Still Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to take Elian on Tuesday, after a pediatrician
engaged by the INS warned her in a letter that ``Elian Gonzalez is
now in a state of imminent danger to his physical and emotional
well-being in a home that I consider to be psychologically
abusive,'' because she thought the situation was too confused.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to take Elian this week because there was some
bad karma attached to the anniversaries of Waco, the Bay of Pigs,
Oklahoma City and Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to take Elian on Sunday because it's Easter.
Then comes Earth Day, Arbor Day, the NBA playoffs and Cinco de
Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Father's Day. Weather permitting. (BOX)

Ho hum: Yankees beat Rangers 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pitchers usually need to be at their best to
beat Orlando Hernandez and the New York Yankees. Kenny Rogers was
hardly that last night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rogers said bluntly, ``I was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers would seem to back up that assessment. Rogers
allowed six runs in the first four innings, and that was more than
enough for Hernandez, who pitched the Yankees to a 6-3 victory
before 43,644 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who once again started slowly and finished strong,
pitched a complete game to give the Yankees their fourth
consecutive victory over the Rangers this season. Including regular
season and playoffs, the Rangers have lost 35 of their past 46
meetings against New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to deal with, because we're always being asked about
it, but we've got nobody to blame but ourselves,'' first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro said. ``The only way the questions will stop is for
us to play baseball, play well and start beating these guys. I
think they're the best team in baseball, but they can be beat. We
can do it. We just have to figure out a way to do it, and we
haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Said left fielder Chad Curtis, ``I've got the solution. We've
got to score more runs than the other team. That's the solution ...
the process I'm not so sure about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis, who spent the past two years with the Yankees, said
what they're doing is no secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good baseball players playing the game the way it was
meant to be,'' Curtis said. ``It's not complicated. It's very
simple. I'm not saying everybody can do it. But it's a simple game.
They don't beat themselves. The run they've had the past four years
is good evidence it's the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are on a pretty good run, too, having won three
division titles in the past four years. That's substantial evidence
they know how to play the game right.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, when they face the Yankees, everything changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers tried to pitch with a stiff back and couldn't do it,
falling behind 3-0 in the first inning. Derek Jeter, the Yankees'
second hitter, gave them a 1-0 lead with a home run to center
field, a blast that was followed quickly by doubles from Paul
O'Neill and Tino Martinez, and Jorge Posada's single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had bad stuff,'' said Rogers, whose fastball rarely
topped 84 mph. ``I wasn't finishing pitches the way I should.
That's the way it goes. You toe the rubber, you go with what you
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler hit a two-run homer off Hernandez in the second
inning, but, after the Rangers blew a big chance in the third, the
Yankees added three more against Rogers in the fourth. Posada's
two-run homer hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my pitches were up,'' Rogers said. ``That was the
key, especially in the first inning. A few pitches were low but
nothing consistent. With New York, you're going to have to win a
game 2-1. It's not that we've played poorly; we just haven't done
the things we need to do to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Like hammer Hernandez when he's struggling. Curtis and Ivan
Rodriguez started the Rangers' third with singles, putting runners
on first and second. But, after four pitches, Hernandez was out of
the inning. Palmeiro was thrown out on a little roller in front of
the plate, moving runners to second and third, David Segui popped
out to left and Ruben Mateo bounced back to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   That was it. After the Yankees scored three in the fourth, the
Rangers managed just three hits over the final six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what ... it's only April,'' Curtis said. ``I'm hoping
we get another shot at those guys down the road. But we've got to
take care of business before then because you know they're going to
be there.'' nn

PINSTRIPE FLU STILL HAS STRANGLEHOLD ON RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For the home team, we offer the following
unsolicited advice:
</P>
<P>
   It's a line from the movie The Natural, uttered with memorable
good intentions by a psychoanalyst that the downtrodden New York
Knights have hired to shake their doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Before the real-life New Yorkers, the Yankees, mercifully depart
the premises today, the Rangers would be wise to follow the
rent-a-shrink's advice and detach themselves from the humbling
reality.
</P>
<P>
   With last night's relatively mundane 6-3 victory, the Yanks have
beaten the Rangers seven in a row, dating back, I think, to the
Truman administration. The Rangers have won only 11 of their past
37 regular-season meetings with New York.
</P>
<P>
   That's not domination. That's almost paranormal.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday night's Satanic ending didn't substantiate it, nothing
will. The foul ball off Luis Alicea's foot, which transformed into
a most opportune New York double play, wasn't on the last Penn and
Teller HBO special, but stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Call it black magic. Call it the Pinstripe Flu. Call the
equipment man and tell him that straitjackets are the Rangers' new
alternate uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' dizzying wizardry has gotten into the Rangers'
heads so much, manager Johnny Oates made the observation, ``As
eventful as last night was, it just seemed that tonight was one of
those methodical nights where you just played a game of baseball
without anything exciting happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody spontaneously burst into flames or changed into a cow, in
other words. In the Monday night game, even home-plate umpire Jeff
Kellogg was sucked into the Yankee vortex _ rendered momentarily
stupid during the 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling here is that Oates didn't help his team's ongoing
malaise by sitting oddly silent during the inning's confusion. Most
baseball managers _ and some men of the cloth, even _ would have
screamed bloody murder to the point of ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Would it have changed the call? No.
</P>
<P>
   But the deeper observation is that when they play the Yankees,
the Rangers have learned to numbly accept their fate. Somebody in a
``NY'' cap is going to slap a timely single, snatch away a would-be
Rangers hit, or turn water into pinstriped wine, whenever the two
teams meet.
</P>
<P>
   The theory here is that, without the customary demonic
intervention, manager Joe Torre's Yankees would still be dominating
the series. They are the best team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But with the added psychological trimmings, the would-be close
games also are going to the Yankees, who scrap, don't quit, and
possess a telling self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers? They are Yankee wannabes, no more than the rest of
the American League pack.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said from the start, from the early days after the Juan
Gonzalez trade, that this would be a Rangers team that would come
along slowly. There are too many new and young faces, plugged into
too many vital and scattered places, to have expected the Rangers
to hit the April ground running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning that there were going to be nights
when we'd struggle,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   His kids will get better, Oates seems to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer that you grow much faster through
failure,'' the manager noted. ``Someone once told me that if you
have sunshine every day, sooner or later you'll have a desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will survive. They'll get better. They will learn the
league and learn not to give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they swallow hard. Even with his home run last night,
newcomer Gabe Kapler's average still roosts at .229. Rookie Ruben
Mateo went 0-for-4 to drop to .241.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to be all right,'' Mateo said. ``I just don't
know when.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be, let me suggest, until the Yankees leave town. nn

MAVERICKS END SKID AGAINST LAKERS

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks wrapped a nice bow around Don Nelson's
final home game as an NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
   They beat LA.
</P>
<P>
   On a night that had a festive, playoff-type atmosphere, the
Mavericks closed out their home schedule with a 112-102 triumph
over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win increased the Mavericks'
record to 39-42 as they snapped a 19-game losing streak against the
Lakers that dated to April 5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great feeling about this game,'' Nelson said. ``We are
playing so well, and I looked forward to this game more than any
game this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a great game, and we won. They are just
playing not only good basketball, but exciting basketball. This is
the way we pictured it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks close their season tonight at 7 in Minnesota
against the Timberwolves (50-31) in what Nelson has said is his
final game as an NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have built a lot of teams, but I don't know that I have been
more proud of a team than this one, because of our start,'' Nelson
said of the 9-23 start. ``Our start was tough, and we got behind
the eight ball, and these guys haven't given up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered last night's game with the NBA's best record,
and were the only Western Conference team that the Mavericks had
not defeated this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks treated this game as if it were their playoff
outing. They hustled, dove for loose balls, even tossed souvenir
basketballs into the stands before and after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley even delivered a hard foul that sent Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal sprawling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 38 points and 20 rebounds, and he was
disturbed that Nelson used some of his players to intentionally
foul him during key moments of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know every team is going to be after us, and we just have
to be ready for it,'' O'Neal said. ``We just have to cut down on
our own mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley led Dallas with 25 points, Steve Nash had 23
points and eight assists, and Cedric Ceballos scored 21 and grabbed
six rebounds. Also for the Mavericks, Bradley had 12 points and six
rebounds, and Dirk Nowitzki and Hubert Davis scored 10 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 58 percent in the first half, but led only
59-57. With the sellout crowd of 18,190 shouting ``Beat LA, Beat
LA,'' the Mavericks stormed back to take an 80-75 lead going into
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks used key free throws and crucial shots by Finley
to put away the Lakers in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan was sensational, and these guys carried it out
again with no preparation and no practice,'' Nelson said. ``We just
met before the game and went over our strategies.'' nn

CARBONNEAU SCORES WINNER AS STARS BEAT OILERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Somebody forgot to tell Guy Carbonneau he
isn't an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   He's 40 for crying out loud. There aren't any other
40-somethings playing in the NHL, much less having an impact in the
Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So when Stars coach Ken Hitchcock challenged his impact players
before Game 4, he didn't really mean Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest player in the NHL listened anyway, doing what he has
done all season. Doing exactly what nobody expects. Tuesday night,
it was score the winning goal in the Stars' 4-3 victory against the
Edmonton Oilers at Skyreach Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone has to be accountable,'' said Carbonneau, who
had a cut by his left eye from being inadvertantly hit by a stick
from his own bench. ``I didn't real think I played well in the
first game here. For whatever reason, the emotion wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   No big deal really. All it did was give the Stars a chance to
close out the Oilers in Game 5 on Friday at Reunion Arena. All it
did was salvage a game the Stars should've won easily had it not
been for the heroics of Oilers winger Bill Guerin. All it did was
send the Stars back to the Dallas with the split they so
desperately craved and a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven, first-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   When Carbonneau skated across the blue line with slightly more
than 15 minutes remaining in the third period, the score was tied
3-3. Two Stars had already wasted two leads. The Oilers were
beginning to get confident. You could almost see them thinking
``Hey, we can hang with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Then with a flick of his wrist, Carbonneau sent a shot flying
toward Oilers goalie Tommy Salo. The shot found a way to sneak
between past Salo on the glove side at 5:01 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carbonneau and Keane felt very accountable for the way we
played (in Game 3),'' Hitchcock said. ``They wanted to be big
factors, and they were.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Hitchcock didn't really mean Carbonneau when he said his
impact players had been outplayed by the Oilers' impact players in
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Carbo probably thought he did,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``That was a big goal by him, and we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was thinking more along of the lines of Mike Modano,
Brett Hull, Nieuwendyk, Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   They needed to do better, he said, if the Stars were going to
win the series.
</P>
<P>
   They responded. The Stars got goals from Modano, Hull and
Matvichuk. Nieuwendyk was flying all night and hit a post on a
breakaway attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good effort from Hull, and Nieuwendyk stepped up,''
Hitchcock said. ``Nieuwendyk made a difference tonight. We came
with a good one-two punch. Getting four goals on the road is pretty
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, part of the resurgence was Hitchcock's doing. He
switched lines in the second period Tuesday night, giving them a
retro look. Modano and Hull were reunited for the first time in a
month, and Nieuwendyk played with Jamie Langenbrunner. These were
the lines the Stars used to win a Stanley Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
   They worked pretty well Tuesday night, too, helping the Stars
overcome a shaky start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good change,'' Modano said. ``Jamie and Joe really
mesh together.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Game 3, the Oilers had a five-on-three power play early.
Hatcher went to the box 50 seconds into the game for slashing.
Matvichuk joined him 1:40 later. Carbonneau, one of the Stars' best
penalty killers, was assessed a 10-minute misconduct on the play
for arguing with the referee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a stupid misconduct. When I came back on the bench, I
watned to try to help the team as much as possible. In 20 years,
what's 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars killed off the 20 seconds of five-on-three and the
remainder of Matvichuk's penalty. They didn't allow a shot. The
penalties obviously didn't sit well because the Stars came back
angry, scoring two goals in 48 seconds not long after.
</P>
<P>
   Hull scored at 5:02 of the first period, chipping in a rebound
of a Scott Thornton shot. The play began when Nieuwendyk pressured
the defenseman trying to get the puck out of the Oilers' end.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 48 seconds later, Matvichuk made it 2-0 with a single
swing of his stick. He took a pass from rookie center Aaron Gavey
and one-timed it past Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the raucous crowd of 17,100 didn't sound so raucous.
You couldn't hear them.
</P>
<P>
   Not a word, not a peep until 9:19 of the period when Guerin
scored the first of his three goals.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive game, an Oilers player had a hat
trick against the Stars. In Game 3, it was Doug Weight. Tuesday
night, it was Guerin.
</P>
<P>
   He scored two goals two minutes and 24 seconds apart in the
first period to erase a 2-0 Stars lead. He added another at 18:06
of the second period to erase what had become a 3-2 Stars lead.
</P>
<P>
   Only two minutes and 51 seconds before, Nieuwendyk had a chance
to extend the Stars lead to 4-2. His shot on a breakaway hit the
post, trickled behind Salo but didn't cross the line.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour stopped Oilers winger Ryan Smyth on a
shorthanded breakaway attempt at 7:26 of the second period. Belfour
finished with 21 saves, and Salo had 14.
</P>
<P>
   Salo probably should've made a save on the Carbonneau shot, too.
It doesn't have the velocity it once did. Carbonneau isn't an
impact player like he once was.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not if you equate impact with goals. He doesn't score as
many of those any more.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he kills penalties, gets in Oilers tough guy Georges
Laraque's face, plays on the shut-down line, grinds on the ice in
the final seconds when the Oilers pull the goalies and plays an
all-around solid game.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and every once in a while, he scores a game-winning
goal. nn

STARS' VICTORY WAS NO IMPOSSIBLE MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ The Dallas Stars' objective when they left
Dallas for this remote outpost in the Canadian northwest was hardly
deemed worthy of calling in the ``Mission Impossible'' crew.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the defending Stanley Cup champs arrived here from
Texas on Friday with a swagger and a comfortable 2-0 lead in this
best-of-seven opening round playoff series and the disheartened
Edmonton Oilers were in complete and total disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, summing
up the situation before Game 3. ``I see us having to win ``a'' game
here. Doesn't matter if it's Game 3 or Game 4. Winning one allows
us to control our own destiny at home, without this coming down to
a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can win one of these two games, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we exhale now?
</P>
<P>
   Stars' general manager Bob Gainey was heading for the phone to
make the call to Tom Cruise and the M.I. gang _ and his team was
looking at the unpleasant prospect of having to leave their bags
packed for the long return trip to Edmonton _ when playoff-tested
Guy Carbonneau, the oldest player on the ice, re-introduced himself
to the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau's quick and deadly wrist shot early in the third
period not only caught Oilers' defender Igor Ulanov and goalie
Tommy Salo by surprise, it sucked the air out of an entire city and
lifted the Stars to a had-to-have it 4-3 victory Tuesday night at a
Skyreach Centre so charged with emotion, it seemed as if the old
arena might actually explode at times.
</P>
<P>
   This series is far from locked up, but the Stars have regained
their two-game advantage with a 3-games-to-1 lead and can end it
with a victory Friday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Praise God and pass the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   That's the essence of the big picture, but there's more, much
more to consider.
</P>
<P>
   After the first two games the Stars looked untouchable. They had
done what they had said they could do, flipping the switch back to
``on'' after ending the regular season on a lifeless five-game
winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oilers, benefiting enormously from the extra day off
between Games 3 and 4, not only regrouped, they seized the momentum
in front of their riotous home crowd by routing the Stars 5-2 in
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Stars won Tuesday night, they did it despite
blowing 2-0 and 3-2 leads, something this team is not supposed to
do. Gone is the once-almost sacred perception that the Stars are an
impregnable defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   It had been over eight years since the Oilers had registered a
playoff hat trick, but they got a pair back-to-back in these two
games, from Doug Weight Sunday and Bill Guerin Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars return to Dallas with their 3-1 lead, but also with
the myth exposed. If they play the way they did in these two games
in Edmonton, They can be had, if not by the Oilers, than down the
playoff road by someone better.
</P>
<P>
   Put that away to ruminate on for another day, because there were
also many positives to be drawn from Tuesday night's shaky victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had challenged the Stars to play ``desperate'' hockey
and to match the intensity level the Oilers had played with in Game
3. In particular the silver-haired coach had appealed to his
prime-time players _ Mike Modano, Brett Hull, Joe Nieuwendyk and
Derian Hatcher _ to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' stars responded with impressive tenacity and
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we got a good effort from Hull, and I thought
Nieuwendyk stepped up,'' Hitchcock said. ``I thought Brett did what
he had to do tonight. He was ready to load it up on every shift but
the real difference was Nieuwendyk. He was a threat all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that had something to do with a blast from the past.
Hitchcock pulled a page out of last year's year's Stanley Cup
manual and put Hull back on a line with Modano and paired Jamie
Langenbrunner with Nieuwendyk, two of his favorite pairs in '99.
The strategy seemed to provide a much-needed spark.
</P>
<P>
   The game wasn't five minutes old when Hull swatted a rebound off
a Scott Thornton shot past Salo for a 1-0 Stars lead. Thirty-eight
seconds later Richard Matvichuk whistled a blast from the left
point that nicked an Oilers' defenseman, skipped once and hit the
back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   For just a moment, you could actually hear yourself think in the
frenzied arena. But only a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We led 2-0,'' Hitchcock said, ``but the game was still going a
thousand miles an hour and we were kind of reeling there. I thought
what settled us down was the third goal. After that we started
playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars had a healthy Sergei Zubov and Jere Lehtinen they
would have a reasonable shot at defending the Cup. How far they can
go is certainly a matter of pure conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, they're simply happy to be going home with their
two-game advantage once again safely tucked in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Cancel the phone call to Mr. Phelps ... for now. nn

STAGE SET FOR FIRST BIG ENTERTAINMENT STRIKE IN DOZEN YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The western contingent of the country's two
largest actors' unions set the stage for what could be the first
major entertainment industry strike in 12 years, voting unanimously
Tuesday to authorize a walkout if a contract is not reached by May.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint National Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild
and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists objects to
a proposal by the television and radio advertising industry to give
actors a flat fee for their work in commercials on cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Actors want to extend the current pay system of compensating
them each time a commercial appears on network television.
</P>
<P>
   They also demand a compensation provision be established for ads
appearing on the Internet and want airings of commercials to be
monitored to ensure an accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, said SAG spokesman Greg Krizman, advertisers count
how many times a commercial runs and compensate actors appearing in
them using an honor system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to end that honor system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike could still be averted if the advertisers return with
a better offer between now and May 1, Krizman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have to exhibit some real good faith bargaining,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Section of the SAG/AFTRA board of directors voted to
authorize the strike Sunday, after rejecting a final offer from the
American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of
National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote of their West Coast counterparts was needed to give
final authorization to the strike, which is scheduled to start May
1.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople representing the negotiators of the two New
York-based advertising organizations could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the AAAA website calls the ``pay-per-use'' compensation the
unions want extend to cable ads ``outdated'' in an April 6 update.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain hopeful that if both sides can accept that the
pay-per-use method is conceptually flawed in today's market, the
economic gulf separating the parties can be bridged.''

THIS TIME, MARINERS VICTIMS OF BATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It won't be too much longer before those keeping score
at Mariners games put in for hazard pay.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle found itself involved in yet another score-a-thon
Tuesday night. Only this time, the Mariners were not the
perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Seattle's offense looked unstoppable in
Toronto, churning out runs like a mint churns out pennies. The M's
scored almost at will, totaling 47 runs in three games against
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But in Chicago, the script played differently. As did the
Mariners themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Mariners found themselves bound, gagged and tied
on the railroad tracks, helpless as the iron-and-steel locomotive
crewed by the White Sox churned furiously closer, Dudley Do-Right
nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did manage to extricate themselves from the
predicament, but only barely, escaping
cool-but-not-completely-frigid Comiskey Park without victory,
without warmth, without even much dignity in the wake of an 18-11
thrashing by the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played good baseball this year,'' Mariners manager Lou
Piniella said. ``Today was really the only time that we were out of
a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this time, we were out of it in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of all this was an 11-run, nine-hit fourth
inning that was every bit as bad for the M's pitching staff as the
weekend in Toronto had been good for the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele entered the inning with a 6-2 lead. He could do
nothing with the White Sox, a fate that also swept up relievers
Jose Paniagua and Paul Abbott. By the time Mark Johnson's second
hit of the inning, a three-run homer, brought the scoring to a
close, the Seattle pitching staff had been folded, spindled and
mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a short night on the field,'' Sele said. ``But it's
going to be a long night at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 runs was the most allowed in an inning by the Mariners
since 1984. It was the most scored by the White Sox since 1987. And
there weren't any rainbows at the end in a game in which the
Mariners pitched ugly _ almost too ugly for words.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle came into the game having given up the fewest runs in
the American League, but it's safe to say the Mariners' status as
league earned-run average kings is on shaky turf this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele had looked vulnerable in the first three innings, but
nothing he'd done in the early going _ three singles, three walks _
prepared the Comiskey Park crowd for what was coming. Sele knew he
wasn't sharp, but even he wasn't prepared for what followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gotten a double play in the third to get me out of
trouble,'' Sele said. ``But I was scuffling all night, trying to
find an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sele, who pitched a masterful, three-hit shutout in his
previous start, there were only questions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton doubled to start the fourth, scoring on a Carlos
Lee single. Greg Norton homered.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, right? Wrong. Seattle still held a 6-5 lead, but it
was obvious that Sele's time on the mound was dwindling at a
furious pace. Singles by Johnson, Ray Durham and Jose Valentin
loaded the bases and forced Sele's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brutal out there,'' Sele said, his lips pursed in the
manner of a perplexed man. ``I didn't give my team a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While true, no one else pitching for the M's did, either.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua took over, got one out on a warning-track sacrifice fly
by Frank Thomas, then intentionally walked Magglio Ordonez and hit
Paul Konerko, forcing in a run. That also forced in Abbott,
although the force was not with the right-hander, just as it was
not with any of the not-quite-Jedi-Knight Mariner pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was stung for three more hits before the inning was over,
the finale being Johnson's first homer of the season, a blast that
buried the Mariners under the rubble it left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a game like this, you have to remind yourself to live in
the present, to pitch in the present,'' Abbott said. ``The bottom
line is this is just one game, and it wouldn't be any different if
we'd lost 2-0. Thinking like that is the only thing that keeps me
sane.''
</P>
<P>
   And what, exactly, drives Abbott insane?
</P>
<P>
   ``Struggling with my main pitch, the changeup, like I have been
the last two or three times out,'' Abbott said with a wan,
weight-of-the-world smile. ``You have a definite mindset when you
have all your pitches, and when you don't have one that you're used
to relying on, then it's like, `Now what do I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Mariners, come back Wednesday and hope that
Gil Meche, the starting pitcher, wasn't absorbing anything that
happened Tuesday night.

BATTLE LOOMS OVER MAYOR'S NEW BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several Los Angeles City Council members recoiled
Tuesday at parts of Mayor Richard Riordan's proposed budget _
including resurrecting a plan to use tobacco settlement dollars for
Rampart corruption payouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be pretty contentious in a few places,'' said
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, a member of the committee reviewing
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor delivered his $4.4 billion budget plan, for the fiscal
year that begins July 1, to the council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget will improve the quality of life for Angelenos and
make this city a much better place for children to pass on to their
children,'' Riordan told the council.
</P>
<P>
   Already at issue was a plan the mayor knew would draw fire:
Raising money to pay the city's anticipated liability from the
Rampart Division police scandal by selling bonds that would be
repaid using roughly $300 million in revenue the county will get
over the next 25 years from the national tobacco litigation
settlement. About $91 million would be raised immediately on the
promise of that long-term income.
</P>
<P>
   The council rejected a similar Riordan initiative earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Hal Bernson objected to plan, saying the tobacco
dollars should be directed to anti-smoking education and health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco settlement should be used for what it was
earmarked for,'' Bernson said. ``I don't think that should be
sidetracked for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs said he thinks it is too early to dedicate
millions for Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've heard yet enough public input on paying
the costs of Rampart. That's the public's money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Councilman Michael Feuer, chairman of the city's ad hoc
committee on the budget, said the mayor's plan is easier to swallow
because it also includes $30 million in cash next year to pay
Rampart claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different strategy and, I think, a much more productive
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget committee will hold 10 days of hearings starting
April 26 to review the budget, which then will be subject to the
approval of the full council.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, council members praised the budget's emphasis on
children and public safety. The budget continues a program to
reduce and cut fees for children participating in recreation
programs, and adds a new police station in Mission Hills and two
new fire stations in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes money for several items proposed this
year by council members, Feuer said, including increased emergency
medical services and more money for sidewalk repairs and
playgrounds accessible to disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Some council members balked at the mayor's proposal to scrap the
L.A. Bridges gang-prevention program. A recent audit by City
Controller Rick Tuttle stated that the program, launched in 1997,
hasn't proved effective and should be closed down.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor wants to use the Bridges' $12 million allotment for
other gang prevention efforts designed to replace the failed
Bridges program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you throw out L.A. Bridges wholesale and start over from
scratch, in a year and a half or two, we'll be in the same place
again,'' Goldberg said.

SURVEY ON CELL-PHONE MANNERS FIND USERS ANSWER THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chirpy ring of the cellular phone echoes off
the bathroom walls, presenting a dilemma _ do you answer the phone,
or nature's call?
</P>
<P>
   Two out of five people do both, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of cell-phone etiquette released Tuesday, 39 percent
of people said they take incoming telephone calls in the bathroom,
though only 31 percent said they would do so while dining in a
restaurant, and 11 percent in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people take affront at people talking on a phone while
eating dinner,'' said Jeffrey Nelson, communications director for
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. ``I can't be
the arbiter of good manners, but I can certainly encourage people
to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Delly Tamer, president of LetsTalk.com, an online cell-phone
retailer that commissioned the survey, said his company wanted to
discern Americans' feelings about where the devices are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's becoming a product everybody can afford,'' Tamer
said. ``So the use in cars, in restaurants, in movie theaters is
much more prevalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, fewer than half of the 557 cell-phone owners
surveyed nationwide said they would take calls in movies or
restaurants. But 76 percent said they would still take calls in the
car, even though a 1997 report in the New England Journal of
Medicine found that talking on a cell phone while driving
quadruples the chances of a crash _ about the same risk as driving
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants and other public places have banned the use of
cell phones, but Nelson said that's an extreme response to
something people should do on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude people are rude,'' he said. ``Putting a new piece of
technology in their hands isn't going to make them any more or less
rude.''
</P>
<P>
   At the landmark Sportsmen's Lodge in suburban Studio City, the
clientele of business people and entertainment executives make cell
phones as commonplace as silverware.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much accepted now,'' said Vesna Saric, who has
been tending bar at the restaurant for a year. ``Everybody's got
them, everybody's connected. One cell phone will ring and everybody
in the bar reaches for their phones. It's pretty funny.''
</P>
<P>
   After being interrupted by a call during a coffee break with a
friend at Starbucks, entertainment attorney Ron Tropp of Woodland
Hills said he only got his phone because he has ``certain clients
who want to reach me anytime, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep it to a minimum,'' he said. ``It's intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Composer, musician and producer Ramin Zamani, also of Woodland
Hills, said he needs his phone for his business, though he ``would
be very disturbed'' if he heard one go off while performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did it twice myself, so it can happen,'' he said,
recalling a couple of instances when he forgot to shut off his
phone in concert halls. He quickly jabbed it off each time.
</P>
<P>
   Ringing phones haven't been a problem at the Los Angeles Museum
of Contemporary Art, said visitor services coordinator Valerie
Partridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had one or two complaints in the past, where someone
was on the cell phone in the gallery and they were loud,'' she
said, so guards asked them to take the conversations outside.
</P>
<P>
   Phone improvements such as greater clarity and sensitivity,
which eliminate the need to shout into the mouthpiece, or silent,
vibrating ringers have erased some of the offenses. But that might
be outweighed by the devices' increasing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Tamer said industry analysts believe 40 percent of American
households have a cellular phone _ a number they say will jump to
70 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
   With that rise might come an increase in the two out of five
cell-phone owners who consider the bathroom part of their coverage
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think about that,'' Tamer said. ``If you
take a call in the bathroom, you'll take a call anywhere.''

VOTERS TO DECIDE STADIUM'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY NENA BAKER AND TESSIE BORDEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Talk about dramatic finishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Cardinals scored in the waning hours of the
legislative session Tuesday, April 18, finessing out of the House a
stadium-financing plan that had been voted down just a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for building a $331 million home for the
Cardinals, using largely money that will be raised through tax
hikes on hotel rooms and rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County voters likely will get the ultimate say this
fall. Gov. Jane Hull is expected to sign Senate Bill 1220 and put
it on the Nov. 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals backers sent an all-out blitz - former Gov. Fife
Symington was pressed into play - and changed the minds of half a
dozen lawmakers to pass the bill out of the House with the minimum
required 31 votes. The team now must win the hearts of voters, who
may be more reluctant to embrace the plan.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona Republic poll of 600 state residents in late December
showed 85 percent opposed to spending tax money for a new stadium
for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And the team's last attempt at a publicly funded facility, the
Rio Salado Crossing Project, failed by a 2-to-1 margin at the
ballot box in Mesa last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we are excited that the people of Maricopa County
get the opportunity to vote on this in November,'' said Mike
Bidwill, the Cardinals' vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful that voters will pass the plan. We have five
months to get a campaign going for them to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money for the plan would be raised by a 1 percent
bed tax surcharge and a 3.25 percent rental car tax in Maricopa
County. At the same time, money generated at the new 73,000-seat
stadium _ including state income taxes from National Football
League activities (a ``jock tax''), as well as sales and
construction taxes - would flow to the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals must contribute $85 million of the estimated $331
million price tag, excluding the costs for land, parking and other
infrastructure. The Fiesta Bowl is committed to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows the Cardinals to retain all NFL revenues as well
as stadium naming rights worth millions. At the same time, the
public authority that will own the facility will pay maintenance
and operation costs, including the Cardinals' game-day expenses.
Those costs are estimated at $420 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wheeler, the Fiesta Bowl chairman, said the funding also
may include a ticket surcharge similar to the surcharge now in
place with Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a stadium, the plan includes new money for state
tourism promotion, Cactus League baseball-stadium enhancements and
youth sports activities _ goodies that worked to entice some
lawmakers who were not inclined to support a stadium bill on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill, Wheeler and Bank One Chairman Michael Welborn, who
headed up a task force charged by Gov. Hull to develop plans for a
new stadium, were reluctant to talk about what might happen if
voters reject the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Wellborn said voter approval for the funding package is Plan B
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally very worried about what might happen if the
voters don't approve it,'' he said. ``Our sports financing group in
Chicago knows a lot of cities that would love to have NFL football.
Cities that have lost these assets have spent in excess of $1
billion trying to bring them back. I can tell you that people in LA
are terribly interested in what's going on with this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles last fall lost its bid to acquire the NFL's 32nd
franchise to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill described the Cardinals' latest plan as a better deal
than Rio Salado Crossing, which called for a general sales tax,
because hotel and rental-car taxes have less impact on Arizona
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bidwill and a brigade of stadium lobbyists had
some tense moments watching the vote unfold.
</P>
<P>
   As the House tally board held steady at 30 yes votes, one vote
shy of passage, Rep. Dan Schottel, R-Tucson, rose and said he was
changing his vote from no to yes.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Schottel told reporters he flip-flopped after
Symington gave him a call to encourage a yes vote, and then called
back to thank him.
</P>
<P>
   Schottel said he'd heard ``from a real governor,'' a clear shot
at Hull, whom conservatives have long thought to be too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't believe it's a good bill,'' said Schottel. ``But
if it brings revenues to Arizona then I can support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, too, contacted lawmakers
from the minority party who opposed the bill in an attempt to win
yes votes. But no Democrats switched their votes in spite of the
lobbying juggernaut that included an e-mail campaign by stadium
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to mention any names, but all of a sudden
lobbyists had a revelation that there was a Sally Gonzales in the
Legislature,'' said Rep. Sally Ann Gonzales, D-Tucson. ``I'm amazed
at how many people were working this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Schottel, five other representatives switched
their votes from no to yes: Rep. Wes Marsh, R-Scottsdale; Rep. Tom
Gordon, R-Peach Springs; Rep. Syliva Laughter R-Kayenta; Rep. Jim
Weiers, R-north Phoenix and House Majority Leader Lori Daniels,
R-Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of letting the public decide the issue outweighed
the concerns that some lawmakers had about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get a flurry of phone calls and letters from people
asking for the right to vote on this,'' Weiers said. ``I don't
think it's going to pass at the ballot, but this way we'll never
have to ask ourselves, `What if?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he changed his vote after hearing from Navajo Nation
tourism representatives who said the statewide tourism promotion
could benefit the reservation, where unemployment is over 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, if the people of Maricopa County want to tax
themselves and their visitors, then let them,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan called the bill's passage a sad day for the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a huge group of stellar lobbyists working
this one issue,'' said Rep. Kathi Foster, D-west Phoenix. ``You'd
think we were curing cancer or stopping world hunger. Something is
seriously wrong when we spend days on a football stadium and I have
to hold off . . . making my schools safe for children.'' &QL;

CLIPPERS LOSE HOME FINALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The plump, low-flying buzzards circling the
Clippers have been served the final home course in this season's
14-67 feast.
</P>
<P>
   They were waved in Tuesday night by the Portland Trail Blazers,
who administered a 116-100 beating before a sellout throng of
18,964 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   As fan depreciation nights go, bowing out against the mighty
Blazers seems as chronologically warped as giving hostages the
bamboo treatment while the treaty is being signed.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 24 points to pace Portland (59-22), which is
poised to open its post-season skirmish vs. Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who will receive this season's benediction tonight
at Seattle, pushed their losing streak to 17 and backed out of L.A.
behind 15 points from rookie Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent contender Maurice Taylor succumbed to a sore ankle
and didn't suit up, missing his final moment with the Clipper
faithful. Derek Anderson, the Clips' other anticipated free-agent
goner, tied Tyrone Nesby for team-high scoring honors by producing
20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a capsule summation of knowledge acquired during his
single season as a Clipper, Anderson said, ``I learned to respect
the game. I always have. But now I realize that some people
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also said that despite what appeared to be a high level
of training-camp optimism, the team's record through 81 games is no
surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because half the people at training camp expected it to
be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's only momentum swing occurred before the game, when
Anderson said he would not completely rule out the possibility of
signing with the Clippers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers Notes: Clipper Keith Closs confirmed the widespread
radio rumors of his involvement in a Sunday night fight outside a
Southland nightclub. The 7-foot-3, 215-pound Closs, who - according
to team sources - was thumped by as many as 20 people or as few as
four, was not exactly declared the fight's victor. ESPN acquired a
videotape that was purported to be evidence of a one-sided fight,
but the network couldn't tell if the exceedingly tall and skinny
man being beaten was - beyond a shadow of a doubt -- Closs. ...One
of the VIP seats flanking Mr. and Mrs. Donald T. (`T' for The
owner) Sterling was occupied by USC coach Henry Bibby. Job
interview? Don't call your bookie. ... Brian Skinner (high sprain,
left ankle) now has missed 48 games. Eric Murdock (sore left ankle)
was in street clothes for the 41st game. ... Odom's punishment for
skipping Monday's practice was not starting vs. Portland.

   DALLAS - In another day or so, the Lakers' full focus will be on
the playoffs, and their level of play will no doubt match the
occasion. But for one night Tuesday, they instead replayed snippets
of nearly every glitch in their game, the kind of kinks they had
long since expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal shot-putted free throws off the iron.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant flung passes into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA's top defense allowed drive after uncontested drive
into the paint.
</P>
<P>
   This looked a lot like the Lakers of late January as they
stumbled through a 112-102 loss to the newly awakened Dallas
Mavericks before 18,190 at Reunion Arena. For the Mavericks, who
snapped a 19-game losing streak to the Lakers, this !ital!was!off!
a playoff game, with the fevered pitch and postgame celebration to
match.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Lakers (67-14), this was an irritating, if
meaningless, loss as they try to maintain momentum for the playoffs
that begin this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to lose any ballgames, you know what I mean?''
Bryant said. ``But there's nothing you can do about it. It's not
going to be destructive, it's not going to destroy us, anything
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be because this loss ultimately means nothing, of
course. For the first time since the Lakers clinched the NBA's best
record two weeks ago, they played like a team that had nothing left
to gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a dangerous situation to be in,'' Rick Fox
acknowledged, ``especially in this league, when you play on an
opponent's home court, where they've played so well the last two
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 15-5 over its last 20 games, the second hottest team
in the league behind these Lakers. But the Lakers' loss was the
product of some uncharacteristic blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was 7 for 20 from the field for 16 points and coughed up
six of the Lakers' season-high-tying 24 turnovers as the Lakers got
sloppy in a high-tempo game.
</P>
<P>
   And the running, gunning Mavericks outscored the Lakers in the
paint 50-36 behind 25 points from Michael Finley, 23 from Steve
Nash and 21 from former Laker Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   And though O'Neal had 38 points and 20 rebounds, he wilted at
the foul line as Mavericks coach Don Nelson again resorted to
intentional fouling, aka, ``hack-a-Shaq.'' It was Nelson who
started O'Neal's year with such harassment back in November. But
O'Neal had since gained a shooting touch at the line.
</P>
<P>
   It disappeared when Nelson ordered intentional fouls three times
in the closing minute of the third quarter. O'Neal missed all six
free throws, and the Lakers went from a one-point lead to a
five-point deficit and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``That
spelled the game right there.... That made the difference in the
quarter. That kind of energy and the energy you lose from missing
free throws really took us down in the fourth quarter, and it took
us a while to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who made 7 of 10 foul shots in the fourth, finished 8
for 19 from the line, and again lashed out at Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concentrating. Like I said, it's hard to get up for
B.S. coaches and B.S. players. He won today. Quote me on that,''
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were not at full strength. Ron Harper rested his sore
tailbone, joining Derek Fisher on the bench and forcing Jackson to
use rookie John Celestand for 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a group of guys that are banged up right now,'' Fox
said. ``You look around, you say we've got some time to get
healthy. But it wasn't anything else other than them playing a
better game than us today.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers' regular season is down to one game, tonight in
San Antonio, giving them a chance to regain a little lost rhythm
and perhaps a win at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game is going to be important regardless,'' Glen Rice
said. ``We do want to end the regular season on a winning note, and
I think that's going to be a positive thing for us. And we have to
put this one behind us. There's nothing we can do about it now.''

KENNEDY'S 8 RBI SPARK ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO -- It took only one swing of the bat, but Adam Kennedy's
trip to the plate in the top of the fourth inning of Tuesday
night's Angels-Toronto Blue Jays game ignited a flurry of hits,
runs and emotion that finally ended in a 16-10 Angels victory
before 13,825 at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's fourth-inning grand slam was only the beginning for
the second baseman, who finished the game with eight RBI, tying an
Angels record accomplished three times previously, the last time
done by Don Baylor in 1979, also in Toronto. Leon Wagner and Lee
Thomas both did it in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also had a bases-loaded triple in the fifth inning --
just five-feet short of another grand slam -- and an RBI-single in
the ninth. The ninth also featured a bench- and bullpen-clearing
melee, sparked when Blue Jays pitcher John Frascatore hit Scott
Spiezio with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus had doubled in a run to give the Angels a 15-4 lead,
which was followed by a trip to the mound by Blue Jays pitching
coach Rick Langford. On the very next pitch after the meeting on
the mound, Frascatore hit Spiezio on the right leg. Spiezio didn't
charge the mound, but exchanged words with Frascatore as he moved
toward first.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams then gathered along the first-base line for some
obligatory pushing and shoving before order was restored.
Frascatore was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bull-(expletive),'' said Angels first baseman Mo
Vaughn, who was in the center of the action. ``We didn't do that to
them when they dropped seven runs on us (Monday). ... We're not the
type of club that takes that stuff lightly. Somebody could get
hurt. You've got to take your beatings like a man. If you can't get
the ball across the plate, find someone else to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Jays clubhouse after the game, Frascatore denied it
was intentional, but Spiezio had trouble believing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew he was going to do it,'' Spiezio said. ``I could
see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Vaughn, manager Mike Scioscia and left fielder Darin
Erstad were the most active when things were heated. Frascatore's
shirt was torn open when he escaped the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all I could do to keep Mo and Erstad back,'' Scioscia
said, adding he thought the pitch by Frascatore was intentional.
``You always like to give people the benefit of the doubt. I sure
hope he wasn't throwing at him. We weren't doing anything to show
anybody up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never do that. They scored seven runs (Monday) night and
came back with 10 tonight. We wouldn't take that approach. But it
looked pretty obvious to me (that it was intentional).''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who was criticized last season for not joining his
teammates in a fight in Cleveland, noticed that Scioscia was right
along side him during the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all out there together,'' Vaughn said. ``I'm sure he's
been in a lot of 'em. That's what a team is. That was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored six runs in the bottom of the ninth, and it
included former-Dodger Raul Mondesi having to be restrained after
being thrown out of the game by homeplate umpire Al Clark. Mondesi
had flied out, but was upset over a strike call that appeared out
of the strikezone during his at-bat. After being thrown out, tried
to get to Clark. When he finally went to the bench, Mondesi tossed
a cooler and equipment onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   None of the fireworks would have happened if it wasn't for the
career night of Kennedy, who had four of the Angels' season-high 19
hits. He came to the plate in the second inning with the bases
loaded and struck out, which gave him that much more motivation
when he batted in the fourth with the bases full again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, definitely, especially in a 1-0 game,'' said Kennedy,
who raised his average to .367. ``I was really trying to have a
good at-bat, and something good happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one inning later, he batted again with the bases full, and
he hit the first pitch he saw off the right-center field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine something like that happening,'' Kennedy said
of batting three times with the bases loaded. ``People have to get
on base in front of you. They had some good at-bats all night
long.''

ANGELS' SALMON STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO -- Tim Salmon started the 2000 season with a home run in
his first at-bat off the Yankees' Orlando Hernandez, but since then
Salmon has not driven in another run. He's hitting .178 overall and
just .050 (1 for 20) with runners in scoring position. Tuesday, he
went 0 for 6 with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon is doing everything he can to snap out of his slump,
including watching videotape. He has looked at tape of himself from
the 1997 season -- the last time he was healthy for a full season
-- when he hit .296 with 33 homers and 129 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else just to reinforce I can hit the ball,'' Salmon
said. ``I'm not breaking anything down or looking at mechanics.
It's just something that when you're in a slump you want to see you
can get a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his problem has to do with how pitchers are pitching
him. Salmon has 13 walks, which, going into Tuesday's game, was
tied for most in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere through the middle of our lineup, other managers are
going to pick one guy and say 'We don't want to see him beat us,'
'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``For some it's Mo (Vaughn), for
some it's Timmy, for some it's G.A. (Garret Anderson). Timmy and Mo
are getting their walks, and G.A.'s getting RBIs. Although (Salmon)
is not as productive as he will be, I don't see any gross
negligence. Timmy's been disciplined. They're trying to expand the
strikezone on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has six RBIs this season; Anderson has 13.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson (2-0) enjoyed the run support in
Tuesday's 16-10 win, but couldn't get out of the sixth inning. He
threw five scoreless innings before getting the ball up in the
sixth, when he gave up consecutive homers to Craig Grebeck, Raul
Mondesi and Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson allowed four runs and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings,
striking out five and walking none. He had retired 14 of 16 batters
entering the sixth, when all of a sudden he lost his release point,
and consequently his pitches were up in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into a groove as quickly as you fall out of it,''
Dickson said. ``I was typical of that tonight. I cruised into the
sixth inning, made some mistakes and they took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson has allowed only one walk in 18 1/3 innings this season,
and leads the American League with an average of 0.5 walks per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been making use of their bench in recent days,
with injuries to Gary DiSarcina, Darin Erstad and Garret Anderson.
DiSarcina's on the disabled list with a bruised left thumb, but the
injuries to Erstad (shoulder) and Anderson (ankle) caused them to
miss only one game each.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine games he has started at shortstop in DiSarcina's
place, Benji Gil is hitting .300 (9 for 30) with three RBIs and two
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro and Edgard Clemente started in the outfield
Monday night and both made nice running catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game's not easy,'' said Palmeiro, who is hitting .444 (4
for 9). ``You prepare the best you can. You hit early, study tapes
and try to stay on top of it. These guys (starters) stay sharp
because they played yesterday. I don't have that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   The SkyDome roof has been closed the past two nights because of
cold and damp weather. Temperature inside the SkyDome the past two
nights -- 68 degrees. Temperature outside the SkyDome Monday -- 39
degrees; Tuesday -- 43 degrees.

DODGERS' HUNDLEY FINDS POWER SWITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley has seen enough of these sub-.200
starts. Gone through enough struggle. Heard enough doubters.
</P>
<P>
   What Hundley wanted more than anything was a fresh start, and
then there was his early .167 average staring back at him.
</P>
<P>
   But on a cool Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, Hundley made like
a man intent on a new beginning, drilling a two-run home run to
propel the Dodgers to a 5-3 victory over the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of just 26,298 saw the Dodgers hit three home runs,
Darren Dreifort pitch six strong innings to even his record at 1-1
and Jeff Shaw close it in the ninth for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs were the way of the night, and they had the lead
bouncing around through the middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell and his modified goatee gave Houston a 3-2 lead in
the top of the sixth, when he hit his fourth home run of the season
halfway up the left-field pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   But leads came and went quickly Tuesday, and the Dodgers
regained the advantage in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel, the prized Mets prospect acquired in the trade
for Mike Hampton, was either overpowering hitters all night or
watching them hit rockets.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, there were rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros drilled a ground-rule double on a bounce into the
left- field stands to bring up Hundley, who promptly belted a drive
to deep center.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was sure it was out, and stood at the plate a long time
watching the ball's flight. Then he noticed Roger Cedeno running
back like he had a play. The ball just did clear his glove at the
wall for Hundley's second home run of the season and a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel (0-2) left for a pinch-hitter after six innings. He gave
up the four runs on seven hits, but struck out 10 to match his
career-high. That would have come last year in his only other
appearance against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White pushed the Dodgers' lead to 5-3 with a solo home run
off reliever Doug Henry, the one-time closer for the Brewers, to
open the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort started for the Dodgers, and aside from a brief bout of
wildness in the second, pitched well.
</P>
<P>
   In his six innings, Dreifort allowed three runs on three hits.
He walked two and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre hit the first home run on the night, his second of
the season in the fourth to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had taken a 2-1 lead with two semi-gift runs in the
fourth, when Dreifort suddenly struggled with his control.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort walked Cedeno to open the inning and then hit Bagwell
on the arm with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti grounded out to second to advance the runners, and
Richard Hidalgo looped a little broken-bat, two-run single to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo missed half of last season after undergoing knee
surgery, but his 12 RBI are second on the Astros to Bagwell and he
has the look of arising star.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers opened the scoring with a run in the second. Karros
walked and was singled to third by Hundley. Beltre's fly to center
was just deep enough to sacrifice the less-than-fleet Karros in for
the first run.

moderating their pitches, playing down irrational exuberance in
favor of counseling balance. ``Financial advertising has gotten
less silly,'' said Marten Hoekstra, executive vice president and

   NY-LINGERING-DINERS (New York) _ Now that ``No Smoking'' and
``No Cell Phones'' icons have become standard signage at New York
restaurants, it may be time for one more admonishment. No
Lingering! The stock market arrows may be pointing down, but
there's still plenty of hungry money out there: demanding diners
and restaurants eager to turn as many tables as possible in a
night. The occasional bum's rush from a white-tablecloth
establishment is not a brand-new phenomenon. But an informal survey
suggests that skirmishes on the contentious border between service
and civility are on the rise.The go-go '00s are no decade for
lingering, especially over dinner. Fortunes are made and lost in
the time it takes to sip a second cappuccino. By Rick Marin.

   FETTISDAGSBULLAR (Undated) _ Spring rolls, Swedish style: The
sweet almond- and cream-filled buns called fettisdagsbullar are
uniquely Scandinavian treats that were traditionally served every
Tuesday from Shrove Tuesday in February until Easter. Their closest
Anglo-Saxon equivalent is the much more modest hot cross bun, which
the English, with their usual reserve, manage to put off eating
until Good Friday. The distinctive essence of fettisdagsbullar,
literally Fat Tuesday buns, derives from cardamom, almond paste,
sugar and whipped cream.

HARRIS' L.A. MEMORIES LINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS - Del Harris is 14 months removed from his dismissal as
head coach of the Lakers, but his emotions _ both negative and
positive _ were still evident Tuesday as he watched his former team
from the other side of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is one of nine assistant coaches under his friend and
Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent four years with the (Lakers), so naturally anytime you
coach a player and have a good experience with the player, there's
something special about him to you as a coach,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won 61 games under Harris two years ago, but he was
fired after just 12 games last season and replaced by Kurt Rambis.
In a remarkable turnaround, they're now the odds-on favorites to
win the championship under coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with the team 19 days, so what happened last year with
the people they had really is not part of my memory bank,'' Harris
said, ``because that was Kurt's year and (Dennis) Rodman's year and
(owner) Jerry Buss' year. And I don't feel I should be any part of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, the best years I had were there. I think
obviously I would have continued to win games, if that's what
you're asking.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Lakers' quick ascension, Harris said: ``Well, of course,
they're maturing. Not to take away anything from what the coaching
staff has done there, but I think they did find out it's a little
harder to win a game when Shaq doesn't play the other night. Try
that 53 times _ that's how many games Shaq missed for me (over two
seasons). ... And Kobe was 18 and 19 years old. And one of those
years Robert Horry played only 13 games.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal's MVP play is not a surprise to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a huge fan of Shaq and had done the best that
I could to promote him as an MVP sort of a player, because I know
he was for us,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been nice to watch, particularly the evolvement of
Kobe,'' he said. ``He's just turned into a magnificent player. And
he was a magnificent 18- and 19-year-old, but he was 18 and 19.
Now, he's 21 and playing like 27. He's just an incredible player.
They both are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Ron Harper was held out of Tuesday night's game to
rest the bruised tailbone he suffered Sunday against Minnesota. His
status for tonight's game is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed rest,'' Jackson said. ``He's under some pain. It's
something I don't think is serious. ... We'll see how he feels
(tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred to win: The Lakers have lost two of three to the Spurs
and might meet them in the second round of the playoffs, but
Jackson said he wasn't placing much significance on tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have everybody available and they don't more than
likely, because (Tim) Duncan's not available, and so what does that
send a message to whom?'' Jackson said. ``There's nothing to be
gained by it. But then there's the value of the game itself. You
play games, you play hard. ... We want to win in the Alamodome,
there's no doubt about it. But to the extent of damaging our
physical capabilities or anything else for a (playoff) series which
may start on Saturday doesn't seem to make any sense when you only
have a day of practice or two days off in between.''

COMPUTER FIRM FILES TO PROTECT ITS ASSETS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Record sales and strong profits were not enough to
keep computer equipment maker Smart and Friendly Inc. out of
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   High Technology Distributing Co., the parent of Smart and
Friendly Inc., has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after
some of the privately held company's creditors moved to take
control of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Solomon, Smart and Friendly's president, said he expects
the company to quickly emerge from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of compact disc recorders and other computer
peripheral devices has been experiencing record sales this year,
Solomon said. Losses last year are the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filing was, in fact, precipitated by our bank syndicate
having declared a technical default under a trade finance
agreement. This entire situation has caught us by surprise,''
Solomon said. ``We are a leader in our industry and are confident
that we have the support of our key technical partners and our key
customers, as required, to hopefully emerge from this in an
expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, just prior to Thursday's filing, the company was
forced to suspend its business.
</P>
<P>
   Its building, equipment and inventory were seized by a group of
banks led by Sanwa Bank, which issued a written statement regarding
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa said it and two other lenders made loans to Smart and
Friendly that were secured by the company's assets, and the bank
moved to seize them after other efforts to collect were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said the company has regained possession of its assets
and expects to being shipping products immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's 50 employees have been laid off during the
slowdown, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, key employees are running the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``As operations ramp up, we certainly will be working to staff
up to appropriate levels,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy Court documents show the company owes $5.2 million to
20 unsecured creditors. The company claims between $10 million and
$50 million in assets.

ODOM DESERVES ROOKIE AWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The L.A. Kings would be in a very different
position today if their power play had worked as well this year as
Steve Francis'. The Houston guard is poised to run away with NBA
Rookie of the Year honors after turning his back on the Vancouver
Grizzlies, who earned his enmity by selecting him with the second
overall pick of the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Francis forced the Grizzlies' hand and they turned him over to
Houston, where he has averaged 18.0 points and 6.6 assists for a
veteran Rockets team that has fizzled this year, falling short of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots for the NBA's regular-season awards are due today and if
we had one, Lamar Odom would be our choice for Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all the arguments for why Odom is not as deserving
as Francis or Chicago's Elton Brand. We don't dispute that the
6-foot-10 forward is averaging fewer points (16.4) than Francis or
Brand (19.9) and fewer rebounds (7.8) than Brand's rookie-leading
10.0.
</P>
<P>
   We're fully aware Odom hasn't been able to strap his team to his
back and carry it past the Bulls or the Rockets in the won-loss
column.
</P>
<P>
   But to focus on the numbers is to forget the most numbing fact
of all, the card that trumps all others as far as we're concerned:
Odom plays for the most cheerless, the most clueless, the most
wretched franchise in the league.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the NBA's version of Cuba, delivered by fate to a place
where players plot and pray to escape one man's economic tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, no other rookie knows the hardships Odom has seen.
</P>
<P>
   How could they? Among the league's leading rookies, only Odom is
a Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old had no idea what an albatross that affiliation
would be until he started wearing it across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he had heard all the horror stories: How owner Donald
Sterling watches every penny, and we don't mean Hardaway; how the
franchise collects lottery picks like lint and eventually gives
them all the brush-off; and how the only thing shakier than the
ground L.A. residents stand on is the turf on which the Clippers
head coach treads.
</P>
<P>
   The trepidation Odom ought to have felt from the outset didn't
hit him until the Clippers lost 23 of 24 games in a January slide
that spilled into February and the head coach, Chris Ford, was
fired and the team's two veteran leaders, Maurice Taylor and Derek
Anderson, commenced using the past tense instead of the future
perfect when talking about their days as Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew in training camp the way things are,'' Odom said
Tuesday, ``but it was a little shocking to actually see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Odom is no stranger to adversity. He bounced
around colleges before landing at Rhode Island and was dogged right
up until the draft by questions concerning his college test scores
and the company he kept.
</P>
<P>
   So it's saying something when Odom calls this season, ``the
toughest stress I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   All the losses and all the punchlines to the L.A. sports scene's
longest running joke take a toll on a player, even as one as
preternaturally positive as Odom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes its toll on you mentally,'' he said before the
Clippers' final regular-season home game, a 116-100 loss to
Portland. ``You're able to block everything out for moments at a
stretch. But of course it gets tome.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an atmosphere like this, your enthusiasm for the game is
going to get tested. But I haven't lost mine. I'm really looking
forward to being a team leader next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers could use a loyal lead dog. Imagine competing in
the Iditarod with Huskies that run off in different directions,
scattering like a broken dream, and you've got a general idea how
Ford, and interim coach Jim Todd felt this year.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was the captain but he got too bogged down in his own
contract morass to be a proper pacesetter. Eventually _ inevitably
_ the atmosphere in Clipperland would grow so unhealthy, it's a
wonder all the players didn't come down with something similar to
San Joaquin Valley Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Plaza Delirium anyone?
</P>
<P>
   If Odom had any symptoms Tuesday, he sure didn't show it. He
appeared in fine fettle before the 81st game of this endless
winter, playfully wrestling with teammate Tyrone Nesby and smiling
as though it was a game he was preparing for and not some awful
grind.
</P>
<P>
   He was happy that somebody in this utterly forgettable season
wanted to remember him as Rookie of the Year. ``I'm not going to
disagree with you,'' Odom said. ``But I think Steve and Elton
deserve it more. I've been a little bit inconsistent. All the
losing started to wear on me and I carried it on the court with me.
I wasn't mentally strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course. No one is.

PEREZ MIGHT BE ODD MAN OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rainouts, snowouts, and now again it could be,
Carlos Perez is out.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's rainout not only means the Dodgers are skipping his
next regular turn in the rotation, but with Eric Gagne's good
outing and Kevin Brown expected back Monday, Perez could find
himself pushed out of the rotation again.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he doesn't know when Perez
will start, and with Brown's return from a broken right pinkie
still uncertain, would rather not speculate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just wait and see. I don't want to spread all this
conjecture and speculation,'' Johnson said. ``The guy had a pretty
good outing and is in a pretty good frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let's not get too far down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was scheduled to pitch Tuesday. But with Monday's rainout,
they moved Darren Dreifort back to Tuesday, skipped Perez and
scheduled Orel Hershiser to start tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed with Perez's first outing, the Dodgers sent him to
Triple-A Albuquerque, but he stayed with the team when Brown broke
his finger. When the Dodgers wavered over whether to activate him,
Perez grew angry and said he wanted out if they did not want him to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Perez did start and went six effective innings against the
Giants, but the Dodgers are not so convinced he has found himself
after last year's 2-10 season that they would start him over a
41-year-old Hershiser with a sore groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a little bit of a groin,'' Johnson said. ``Ideally, it
would have been to push him back until Friday, but I'm going to go
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown cleared: Dr. Robert Zemel has cleared Brown to throw off
the mound. Brown said he would need only one bullpen outing,
probably Friday or Saturday, before returning to the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like I'll need only one outing in the 'pen to be
ready,'' Brown said. ``I was on the DL with cracked ribs in '93,
and that's all it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Tidbits: Team vice president Tommy Lasorda remains a favorite to
be named manager of the U.S. Olympic baseball team. The decision
could come Friday, but Lasorda said he's unaware of the team's
plans: ``I haven't heard anything. I have no idea what's happening.
They know I'm interested.'' ... Monday's makeup game in New York
has been rescheduled to a 1 p.m. start EDT. It was previously
scheduled to start at 7 p.m., but the Dodgers play Sunday in
Cincinnati and Tuesday in Atlanta. Fox Sports Net 2 will televise
the game Monday.

<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Ralphs Grocery Co. is staking its future on
Southern California's growing desire for smaller, more friendly
markets that feature organic foods and other upscale items such as
prime beef and fine wine.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that demand, the company is opening it's 10th Ralphs
Fresh Fare supermarket today at 674 Las Posas Road in Camarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the region's affluent communities, the chain's new
stores are 40,000 square feet, smaller than a regular Ralphs, and
positioned to compete against Gelson's and Whole Foods Markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it offers the best of everything customers are
looking for in a supermarket,'' said Ralphs spokesman Terry O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   The stores were designed to resemble a Whole Foods by using
earthtones and having a natural look. The stores also feature many
of the same organic and vegetarian items as its competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Whole Foods and other upscale stores in
originally planning the chain, but put a Ralphs twist to it,''
O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   Other upscale and niche markets welcomed the competition, but
don't expect the Compton-based Ralphs to cut into their slice of
the natural foods pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that is expanding,'' said Elizabeth
Carovillano, director of marketing for Whole Foods in Sherman Oaks.
``Of course they are going to replicate us. It's the greatest form
of flattery.''
</P>
<P>
   John Correnti, the assistant manager at Trader Joe's across the
street from a Fresh Fare store in La Canada Flintridge, agreed the
new chain hasn't hurt business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a brand name,'' Correnti said. ``Customers will
continue to shop here for certain products before going to Ralphs
to buy toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its competitors, however, the Ralphs Fresh Fare markets
are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, O'Neil said. The
Camarillo store also features a pharmacy and an indoor/outdoor
dining area.
</P>
<P>
   Ralphs, a division of Cinncinati-based Kroger Co., opened its
first Fresh Fare store in West Los Angeles in October 1998. Since
then stores have opened in Mission Viejo, Villa Park, La Canada
Flintridge, Rolling Hills, Pacific Palisades, Palos Verdes, West
Hollywood and Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a smaller store, we try and cater to the customer's
needs,'' said Raissa Huravsky, assistant manager at Ralphs Fresh
Fare in La Canada Flintridge. ``We also lean toward the specialty
and gourmet item.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a typical Ralphs store, Fresh Fare carries organic fruits
and vegetables, prime cuts of meat and seafood and a bakery. The
store also operates a pre-cooked deli section that offers the
customer everything from grilled salmon sandwiches to chicken Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an upscale supermarket that features new items as well as
all the traditional offerings,'' O'Neil said. ``The prices are the
same for milk and apples as a conventional store.''
</P>
<P>
   Huravsky said the response to the new Ralphs has been
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of customers commuting from Glendale and
Pasadena to do their shopping here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Anderson, of Alhambra who stopped by to buy a frozen
dinner and bottled water to take with her to work, said she shops
at Ralphs Fresh Fare because it's convenient and reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``The ready-to-go food is a little too
expensive.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Record sales and strong profits were not enough to
keep computer equipment maker Smart and Friendly Inc. out of
bankruptcy court.

   High Technology Distributing Co., the parent of Smart and

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
PHOENIX _ On second thought, that was never a way for it to end,
with Charles Barkley limping off the court instead of strutting
across it, propped up by crutches rather than standing on his own
two feet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight he'll do it his way, playing a few minutes at the Laptop
in the Rockets' season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a psychological thing, a bonus,'' Barkley said Tuesday
morning at America West Arena. ``I just didn't want my last memory
on the basketball floor to be being carried out. My fantasy is to
walk away on my own. Maybe some people won't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   There would, of course, be nothing new about that, because most
of the world never could understand the simple truth about Charles
Wade Barkley: It's always been about fun.
</P>
<P>
   We can analyze and compartmentalize, put him under the
microscope or break down his DNA to try to determine the tiniest
parts of what makes him so unique.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, it's the whole package. The athlete and the
actor, the competitor and the clown, the unorthodox body and the
unstoppable mouth, the profanity and the profundity, the friend and
the fighter, the brother and the brawler, the celebrity and the
conscience, the quote and the questioner, the little kid inside the
grown man's body who never for a moment forgot that he had been
given a life of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night I pray and say, `I don't know why you chose me,
but thanks,''' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 123 days since he came down in that horrible, awkward
fall in Philadelphia that wrecked his left leg and abruptly ended a
brilliant career, he has had time to relax and reflect on what he
would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   You take the on-court shenanigans with the off-the-floor
embarrassments, and what you get is a portrait of a human being
with flaws. In other words, except for his basketball ability, not
so different than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Jordan, his contemporary and close friend, there
was always the sense of a photographer's airbrush being used to
cover up the slightest blemish to a preconceived, pre-packaged,
perfect Madison Avenue image.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is who he is, warts and all. The guy next door who wins
the lottery and doesn't take on airs, doesn't change his
personality, just takes full advantage of the opportunity that has
been dropped in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has had a better life than me; I believe that,'' he
said. ``Basketball owes me nothing. I owe basketball everything.
The game has given me everything. When I came into the league, my
goal was to make a million dollars a year, play for 10 years and
take care of my mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm 37 years old, rich beyond my wildest dreams and have
been all over the world. I've met presidents and kings.''
</P>
<P>
   And along the way he became Prince Charles, part superstar, part
celebrity royalty as the NBA went on a meteoric rise in popularity.
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird fueled the takeoff and Air Jordan
eventually lifted the game in terms of marketing and promotion
throughout the '80s and '90s. But it was Barkley _ Sir Charles, the
Chuckster _ who was the trail of fire and billowing smoke off the
launching pad, providing the down-to-earth thrust. In his two
appearances on the U.S. Olympic team in 1992 and 1996, it was
Barkley _ not Jordan, not Magic, not any of the others _ who was
the most popular Dream Teamer with the crowds in Barcelona and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley never set out to be the unofficial voice of the NBA
players through his career. But he figured early on that if he had
to deal with the media, he would do it on his own terms. There was
never a topic or an issue that he would duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me a question, and I'll give you an answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you didn't like it. Even if it made you flinch.
</P>
<P>
   You get all of him, including the contradictions. The player who
was always most apt to break a play called from the bench spent so
much time trying to be a part-time coach. The player who was among
the least likely on the floor to make a 3-point shot was the one
who loved _ to the exasperation of his coaches _ to let one fly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rockets' shootaround Tuesday morning, after four months
of missing practice, he grabbed the ball, took up a spot down in
the low post and started pointing and telling teammates what to do.
</P>
<P>
   After flirting with the idea of making a swan-song appearance in
Phoenix, he sat on the bench Tuesday night, wearing a brown suit
and the look of a man trying to hold on to fleeting memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would like to go out like Michael, making the last
shot to win a game, a championship,'' he said. ``But that's not
possible, and all I want to do is go out there for a few minutes
and try to do something. I'd like to just make a basket.''
</P>
<P>
   A slam dunk would be possible if maybe a half dozen teammates
hoisted him up to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything,'' he said. ``I just want to be out there one more
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He has played in All-Star Games and the NBA Finals, the Olympics
and in countries all over the world, and now it is a brief
appearance on a farewell night in Houston that is most special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my mother and my grandmother and about 20 friends from
around the country coming in, and that means a lot,'' he said. ``I
have loved the way the people in Houston have treated me. I wasn't
sure what the reaction would be after we went to war with the
Rockets in two playoff series when I was in Phoenix. But it's been
nothing but great. I wish I could have played my whole career in
either Phoenix or Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   A career that is down to one final night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sad when anybody comes to retirement, whether you
work in an office or whatever. But I think for an athlete it's even
harder. I've talked to Dan Marino and Wayne Gretzky and John Elway
and, of course, Michael, and they all told me: `Retirement
(stinks).'
</P>
<P>
   ``After this game, I won't ever play basketball again. I don't
think I'll be going to the YMCA to play, though maybe I'll join a
church league and beat up guys to stroke my ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I brought to the game was toughness and charisma and
emotion. You always knew when I was happy, sad, mad or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   That bald head, that round face was like an exposed nerve
ending, acting, reacting, never showing anything except his
feelings, his raw passion. For life, for games, for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   He leaned back in his seat, made a wide sweep with his right
arm, looked out onto the court and up into the seats where the
crowds once cheered his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said the athlete, the actor, the warrior, the
clown, ``this is just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Always was with Charles Barkley.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ It would seem there was nothing else for which to play.
So the Rockets guards played H-O-R-S-E.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Francis on an alley-oop. Shandon Anderson on a flip in
traffic. Cuttino Mobley from 25 feet with a man in his face.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the weekend, the Phoenix Suns played to hold off
the San Antonio Spurs for the home-court advantage in their
first-round playoff series. The Rockets played for giggles. They
drove and bombed and sent a message to another playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   With their guards never looking back, the Rockets blew past the
Suns in the closing minutes 107-98 on Tuesday night at America West
Arena, their sixth win in seven games, including four against
playoff teams. And they had a grand time doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked like junior-high guys,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``There's no pressure on us. Our guys really feel
they can beat anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really got it rolling. We had some great, great
performances. Shandon is getting so comfortable in our system and
with the double teams. He's not only making 3s; he's driving the
seams and taking the ball to the basket. Steve played a tremendous,
solid game. He took the shots that were there and moved the ball
around. And Cuttino gave us a big lift off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   With their carefree attitude allowing them to stroke easily from
all corners of the court, and Charles Barkley back on the bench in
a suit, Anderson, Francis and Mobley combined to score 86 points.
</P>
<P>
   They made a combined 29 of 47 shots. The rest of the Rockets
were 5-of-23 for 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said before the game to be aggressive and came out and got
some shots up,'' Anderson said. ``They had to have this game.
There's no pressure on us. We just go out and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the Rockets with 35 points, making 12 of 20 shots.
Francis had 27, making 10 of 12 shots, with eight assists and seven
rebounds. Mobley had 24 points with five assists and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were led by Penny Hardaway, who had his third career
triple double _ and first in six years _ with 20 points, 12 assists
and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Suns never could slow the Rockets' gunners or match
their swagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everybody one-on-one, went right to the hole,'' Suns
coach Scott Skiles said. ``We tried to double, but they passed the
ball around and made shots. When we came out of the double teams
and tried to challenge, they shot-faked it. We'd jump by them, and
they would run to the hole again.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 81, the Rockets suddenly recovered,
outscoring the Suns 12-2 in the next three minutes, Anderson's
fifth 3-pointer giving the Rockets a 93-83 lead with 5:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough, even with that much time left, for the Rockets
to spread the floor and work the clock, knowing there would be no
way for the Suns to defend the guards one-on-one in the shot
clock's final ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Suns slipped back to within 96-90 with 2:10 left,
the Rockets did what they had all night. Mobley beat Hardaway to
slip inside for a layup. And with 1:12 to play and two seconds
remaining on the shot clock, Anderson rose from 25 feet to nail his
career-high sixth 3-pointer, matching his career-best scoring night
and giving the Rockets a 101-92 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like if we penetrated, we could kick the ball out and
get some easy shots, and we did just that,'' Anderson said. ``We're
playing for next year. Our core guys are healthy and will be back,
and we're playing for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But a last chance to prove something to themselves against a
playoff team seemed to be slipping away like the 17-point lead that
had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   But until that late run, it seemed certain that eventually the
Rockets would need some scoring help from someone other than
Francis, Anderson and Mobley. During a 7-2 late-third-quarter run
that cut the lead to nine, Mobley even got stuck waiting for a dead
ball to allow him back into range.
</P>
<P>
   Francis hit a jumper to push the lead back to 11. But with two
minutes left before the fourth quarter, the Rockets' guards had
combined to make 22 of 32 shots while the rest of the team had made
just four of 22.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost inevitable that unless someone did something to
help the cause offensively, the Rockets' guards would slip just
long enough for one of the Suns to catch fire and for Phoenix to
make the run.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson found his shot, and the Suns' 9-1 run brought
them to within 74-71 heading into the fourth quarter. After
Francis' jumper with 2:24 left in the quarter, the Rockets had two
turnovers and missed two shots while Robinson poured in seven
points.
</P>
<P>
   After controlling almost the entire game, the only play the
Rockets executed was a pass from Barkley to the Gorilla mascot for
a dunk set up to give the Phoenix crowd an opening to salute him.
But just 75 seconds later, the rest of a Rockets lead that had
reached 17 was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had been sparring evenly with the Suns, trading the
lead as they always seem to at America West when Mobley stepped out
to nail the first 3 he had tossed up. Anderson was already gunning
from the 3-point line to help the Rockets keep pace. But once
Mobley added his trigger finger, the Rockets almost shot the Suns
out of the game in the first half.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Let the search begin for another scapegoat. Enron
Field appears to have been exonerated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As much as they might like to blame their pitching woes on the
ballpark that welcomes home runs the way the Statue of Liberty
welcomes immigrants, the Astros are going to have to come up with
another way to defend their home-runs-allowed total, which is among
the highest in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Three home runs accounted for all but one of the Los Angeles
Dodgers' runs in a 5-3 victory over the Astros on Tuesday night at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Enron Field,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``We keep getting hurt by the long ball, and we have to stop doing
that. We can't keep making that many mistakes and still expect to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who have allowed 22 home runs this season, including
seven in the first four games of this road trip, lost their third
game in a row and their eighth out of 13 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The club has not won a series since taking two of three in the
season-opening series at Pittsburgh and is off to its worst start
in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is keep battling,'' Astros second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``If we start panicking now, we're going to be in some
serious trouble. We just haven't been able to get into a groove,
and we still haven't had everyone out there together for any period
of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Singling out the pitching as the cause for the poor start would
be erroneous, considering the Astros have the lowest team batting
average (.225) in the NL. They were held to five hits Tuesday by a
trio of Dodgers, including starter Darren Dreifort, who worked six
strong innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Jeff Shaw survived a ninth-inning threat _ the
Astros brought the tying run to the plate three times _ to notch
his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in each of his outings this season, Octavio
Dotel pitched well at times but not well enough to win. He tied a
career high with 10 strikeouts but surrendered the lead twice in a
span of two innings before exiting the game after the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a terrific game,'' Astros catcher Tony Eusebio said
of Dotel, who surrendered two homers. ``He just made a couple of
mistakes here and there. If he keeps pitching the way he's
pitching, he's going to win a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel matched up well with Dreifort, but the Astros righthander
wasn't quite as mistake-free as his mound opponent, who allowed
three runs on just three hits. No surprise there; Dreifort's
above-average fastball and power sinker/slider combination is a
pretty good recipe for success _ particularly for a righthanded
pitcher _ against the Astros' lineup, which is predominantly
righthanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort is tough,'' Dierker said. ``The only thing that
really keeps him from going to the top of the field is control. He
has a great arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel looked dominant in the first inning, striking out the side
around a single by second baseman Mark Grudzielanek. But a leadoff
walk to Eric Karros proved costly in the second when Adrian Beltre
drove him home with a sacrifice fly to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, whose offense consisted of a Jeff Bagwell single
through the first three innings, showed an opportunistic side of
their own in taking the lead in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodger Roger Cedeno drew a leadoff walk and moved to
second on Dreifort's errant pickoff throw. Bagwell was hit by a
pitch, and Richard Hidalgo drove both runners home with a single to
center. Cedeno has scored at least one run in seven of his last 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, who is often guilty of trying to pull every pitch, did
a commendable job of taking Dreifort's offering on the outside
corner of the plate and poking it through the middle of the
diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied the score on Beltre's second homer of the
season, a solo shot into the left-center-field bleachers, but the
Astros reclaimed a one-run lead when Bagwell rocketed an 0-1 pitch
from Dreifort over the left-field wall in the sixth inning. It was
Bagwell's fourth home run.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Biggio, who singled in the eighth inning, extended
their hitting streaks to 10 games apiece. Dodgers left fielder Gary
Sheffield, who was 0-for-3, saw his hitting streak snapped at 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' 3-2 lead didn't last long. Todd Hundley put the
Dodgers on top with a two-run homer in the bottom of the sixth.
Dotel has allowed five home runs this season, tying Chris Holt and
Jose Lima for the team lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the mistake that killed me,'' Dotel said of Hundley's
home run. ``We just need to start getting a little more luck. When
we get some, maybe we'll start winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers center fielder Devon White added an insurance run with a
seventh-inning solo homer off Doug Henry, who has allowed a home
run in four of his seven appearances this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not playing well, you usually seem unlucky,''
Dierker said. ``We played pretty well (Tuesday). We just have to
keep playing well until we start winning some games.''

HUNDLEY FINDS POWER SWITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley has seen enough of these sub-.200
starts. Gone through enough struggle. Heard enough doubters.
</P>
<P>
   What Hundley wanted more than anything was a fresh start, and
then came a sore knee and an early .167 average staring back at
him.
</P>
<P>
   But on a cool Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, Hundley made like
a man intent on a new beginning, drilling a two-run home run to
propel the Dodgers to a 5-3 victory over the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of just 26,298 saw the Dodgers hit three home runs,
Darren Dreifort pitch six strong innings to even his record at 1-1
and Jeff Shaw close it in the ninth for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice all-around game for the Dodgers, but the most
encouraging aspect was the bat of Hundley. This from a catcher
coming off a disappointing first season with the Dodgers that saw
him struggle to throw out runners and bat just .207.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember last year,'' Hundley said. ``It's gone. I
hear about last year. It's buried in a box. See ya, bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers offense had been fueled largely by the bats of Gary
Sheffield and Shawn Green. But on a night that saw Sheffield's
12-game hitting streak snapped and Green not reach base for the
first time this season, others got into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel, who struck out a career-high 10 in his only other
start against the Dodgers, was at it again Tuesday. Dotel struck
out 10 more, but when he wasn't overpowering, he was getting
rocked.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre drove in the first run with a sacrifice fly and
then hit his second home run, a solo shot to tie it at 2-2 in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was in command for most of the night, but a brief bout
of wildness in the fourth led to a pair of Houston runs. He walked
ex-Dodger Roger Cedeno and then hit Jeff Bagwell with a pitch to
open the inning. Richard Hidalgo's broken-bat single scored both
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's fourth home run in the sixth gave Houston a brief 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt real good, real comfortable,'' Dreifort said. ``I just
had that little bit of wildness in the fourth. I was pressing too
hard to get the leadoff hitters out and I was all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   In his six innings, Dreifort allowed three runs on three hits
and two walks. He struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort threw the ball exceptionally well,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the sixth saw Eric Karros hit a ground-rule double
and Hundley's home run to almost dead center.
</P>
<P>
   A slow start for Hundley was starting to appear in his rearview
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt my knee in (the first series) in Montreal, tried to
make adjustments to my swing, and it was just a downward spiral
from there,'' Hundley said. ``Then you start to press.''
</P>
<P>
   Devon White hit a solo home run off reliever Doug Henry in the
seventh to push the Dodgers' lead to 5-3, and another solid effort
by the bullpen this time from Terry Adams, Mike Fetters and Shaw -
helped end the club's brief two-game losing streak.

SONICS WIN, AVOID LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - The Sacramento Kings and Seattle Sonics played a
game of hot potato Tuesday, and the Lakers were the potato.
</P>
<P>
   Neither wants any part of the NBA's best team in the first round
of the playoffs, but the Sonics want to avoid them most. Their
119-112 victory in overtime sends them to Utah to face the
second-seeded Jazz, handing the Kings to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Lakers look forward to playing the Kings. Despite
winning the season series against Sacramento 3-1, few teams played
L.A. tougher. The Lakers had to rally for each win, including
Friday's 121-114 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (44-37) present a number of problems with their speed
and shooting ability, and no one on the Lakers is a good fit
against Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Kings don't have anyone to stand up against
Shaquille O'Neal, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the first game we have no wins, they have no wins, we
have no losses, they have no losses so it's a new ball game,'' the
Kings' Nick Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you have to contain the big fella, and Kobe's
playing well. You know they're going to get their share of shots.
But we have to limit everybody else and not let other guys beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (45-36) outscored the Kings 12-5 in the extra period,
getting eight points from Gary Payton, including a crucial jumper
with 55 seconds left to put Seattle ahead 115-109.
</P>
<P>
   Payton finished with 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the last baskets, we won and we're fine,'' Payton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis added 22 points and 13 rebounds and Vin Baker, who
has battled personal problems recently, had 23 points and nine
rebounds off the bench. Baker was removed from the starting lineup
last week after the Sonics had lost nine of 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious we're going to have to pick it up against the
Lakers,'' said Kings guard Jason Williams. ``But we're ready for
them and we can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists but
made just 8 of 26 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had 23 points on seven 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   How badly did the Sonics want to avoid L.A.? Seattle coach Paul
Westphal stopped just short of calling the Lakers the best team
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. has really put up one of the best records in history, and
you can make an argument that it's the best record because of the
competition,'' Westphal said. ``The Western Conference this year
has been unbelievable from top to bottom, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their achievement, you can't just act like it's nothing. They
put the numbers up. I think the Kings and the Sonics both feel if
we can avoid playing the Lakers as long as possible, that's
better.''

   Venice, Calif., is as good a place as any to stay young forever.
The sun shines 11 months a year, the temperature never strays too
far from perfect, and the famous (or infamous) boardwalk is home to
more than its share of eccentrics, surfers, bikini-clad roller
skaters and body worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Walford, professor emeritus of pathology at the University
of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, would have to be
considered one of the eccentrics. Walford lives in a one-story,
redbrick industrial building one block from the beach. The windows
are boarded over. The entrance is in back, off an alleyway, through
a wrought-iron gate.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Walford waits behind his desk. He has a shaved head and
a dramatic mustache of the kind more commonly seen adorning the
members of outlaw motorcycle gangs than scientists.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of 50 years, Walford has dedicated his life
and his research to the belief that threescore years and 15 is
woefully short for a human life span and that we should all live
decades longer. And he's had some success.
</P>
<P>
   His most important work has focused on the relationship between
eating and longevity. In a seminal series of experiments beginning
in the 1960s, Walford studied the effect of depriving laboratory
mice of calories and discovered that the less they ate within
reason the longer they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The research convinced him that it might be worthwhile to apply
the same lessons to himself. So since the early 1980s, he has
followed what he describes as a near-starvation diet. Walford
believes that his diet of a mere 1,600 or so calories a day _ about
a third to a half less than a man his size would normally consume _
will give him the best possible chance of living to 120.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 8 inches and 134 pounds _ some 15 pounds less than he
weighed as a college wrestler _ the 75-year-old professor still has
a muscular physique, the product of every-other-day weight workouts
at a local gym. He visits his UCLA laboratory a few times a week to
work on a ``crucial experiment'' he hopes will give him an
immunological answer to postponing the toll of time.
</P>
<P>
   Walford's new research is based on the fact that in mice and
humans, the immune system malfunctions during aging, losing the
ability to distinguish between healthy cells and invasive pathogens
such as bacteria and viruses. Eventually the system begins to mount
so-called autoimmune attacks against the body itself.
</P>
<P>
   Walford has long theorized that this is a root cause of the
regrettable side effects of aging, and he still hopes to find out
if he's right. To test the theory, he is raising mice with
defective immune systems in an ultraclean environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a normal environment, they'd just die of infection,'' he
says. ``But I want to see if they have correspondingly less
autoimmunity and how that influences their survival in a world
without pathogens.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mice live longer, Walford will have provided formidable
support to his immunological theory of aging, which might have
dramatic benefits for future generations. After all, as he has
pointed out, if human aging were completely preventable, and
disease eradicated, the average life span might be about 300 years.
Everyone would eventually die from accidents, but those who are
lucky might live to be 600.
</P>
<P>
   Walford's dream of extending his own life span became tangible
in the early 1980s, when he and his then-student Rick Weindruch
demonstrated that middle-aged mice could also benefit from caloric
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, says Weindruch, now at the University of
Wisconsin Medical School, other researchers had subjected obese
young mice to sudden caloric restrictions. One day the mice ate to
their hearts' content; the next day they were on a strict diet. The
results, as often as not, were prematurely dead mice.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch and Walford took year-old mice and over the course of
two months eased them into a restricted-calorie diet. The mice
lived up to 20 percent longer than their peers. The work persuaded
Walford to severely cut his own caloric intake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy was toying with the idea before,'' Weindruch says. ``This
made him serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Walford has kept to his starvation diet for nearly 20 years. On
a typical day, he has a low-fat milk shake, a banana, some yeast
and some berries for breakfast. Lunch is a large vegetable salad,
and dinner is fish, a baked sweet potato and vegetables. His daily
calorie count comes to about half the 3,000 calories per day many
Americans eat.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   Walford's apartment, which he shares with Swami, a bluepoint
Himalayan cat, resembles a New York artist's loft and is cluttered
with memorabilia of his life and travels, much of which seems
devoted to the female body. Al Hibbs, Walford's friend who is now a
retired NASA space scientist, says Walford's concern with living
forever may be linked to a ``so many women, so little time''
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been married for 20 years and is the father of
three children, Walford has been single since 1972. ``Now he likes
to jump from woman to woman,'' Hibbs says, ``although they seem to
be the same women. He keeps rotating among them.''
</P>
<P>
   Walford says there may be some truth to the
so-many-women-so-little-time theory, but he prefers a broader
explanation: He has always had too many projects going at one time,
and women just happen to be a part of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seemed there were so many things to do in life that
the first thing to do was live longer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Among his projects is a book about his experiences in Biosphere
2, a huge sealed greenhouse in the Arizona desert that was hyped as
the most ambitious closed ecosystem in history. He expects the book
will take at least five years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   He's also working on a Biosphere documentary based on 80 hours
of videotape he took while inside. He's collaborating with Natasa
Prosenc, a Fulbright scholar and a video artist. She's the expert
documentarian, Walford says, but he's taking a course in multimedia
and has built a ``mini-post-production studio'' in the room next to
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's hoping the genetically engineered mice he's
raising in a pathogen-free environment will help uncover more
secrets of the aging process. That raises the obvious question:
Would Walford live in a hermetically sealed, pathogen-free plastic
bubble, if that's what it would take to add 20 or 30 more years to
his life?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd do it for a while. Sure. I mean, look around you,''
he says, laughing and pointing to the windowless office, living
room and video-art studio shut off from the outside world. ``I
could live in here for a long time and keep pretty happy doing all
the stuff that I do.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Kids tire of their toys, college students weary of cafeteria
food, and sooner or later most of us lose interest in our favorite
TV shows. The bottom line is that humans are easily bored.
</P>
<P>
   Why? What prevents us from sustaining high levels of enthusiasm
for macaroni and cheese night after night? Why do long-winded
sermons seem so long-winded?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies buried deep in our nerve cells, which
automatically damp down their initial excited response to stimuli
every subsequent time a stimulus occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Those neurons also enhance responses to things that change _
especially that which changes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   We probably evolved this way because our ancestors got more
survival value, for example, from attending to what moved in a tree
(such as a panther) than to the tree itself.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, as a reaction to a static environment, turns down the
level of neural excitation so that a new stimulus (such as that
panther) stands out more. It's the neural equivalent of
extinguishing a porch light to see the fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   Sensory boredom has many uses. Ever notice how a foul-smelling
room loses its bite after a half-hour or so, even if you haven't
opened a window? That's because the excitation levels of olfactory
neurons, or smell receptors, decrease with each repeated
stimulation, so you notice the offensive odor less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Prove it to yourself with the following three experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slice a fresh onion in half, and hold it under your nose. The
first whiff will be pretty intense, but sniffs two, three, four and
five should become progressively milder, even though the onion
remains as potent from the first inhale to the last. (Keep tissue
handy for onion tears.)
</P>
<P>
   Continue long enough, and you might stop noticing the offending
vegetable altogether as your brain gets used to the odor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperature effects can also produce some amazing phenomena.
Grab a thermometer and three large bowls. Fill the first bowl with
cold water and ice, the second with water at room temperature
(roughly 70 degrees Fahrenheit), and the third with water hot
enough to be uncomfortable but not scalding (110 degrees Fahrenheit
will do the trick).
</P>
<P>
   Place your left hand in the cold bowl and your right hand in the
hot one. Leave both hands in the bowls for about 30 seconds. Then
place both hands in the room-temperature water. After about 30
seconds, the hand from the cold bowl will begin to feel warmer than
the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of hot and cold don't derive directly from
temperature but from the difference between the temperature your
thermal receptors have gotten used to and the warmth or coolness of
objects stimulating them. Since your right hand had adapted to the
hot water, the room-temperature water seemed cool by comparison,
while the reverse was true for your left hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary behavioral responses can also exhibit neurological
boredom. Sneak up on a friend and yell octopus in her ear, and
you'll get a startled reaction. But octopus your friend a few
minutes later, and you'll see much less of a jump (although some
other type of behavior may emerge).
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon, called habituation, takes place in the brain
but doesn't require a specific change in the behavior of sensory
nerves. Your friend hears the word octopus but doesn't jump,
because she's habituated.
</P>
<P>
   Startle yourself out of ennui with more novel information on
sameness and the brain at www.discover.com/brainworks.

<P>
   Kids tire of their toys, college students weary of cafeteria
food, and sooner or later most of us lose interest in our favorite
TV shows. The bottom line is that humans are easily bored.
</P>
<P>
   Why? What prevents us from sustaining high levels of enthusiasm
for macaroni and cheese night after night? Why do long-winded
sermons seem so long-winded?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies buried deep in our nerve cells, which
automatically damp down their initial excited response to stimuli
every subsequent time a stimulus occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Those neurons also enhance responses to things that change _
especially that which changes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   We probably evolved this way because our ancestors got more
survival value, for example, from attending to what moved in a tree
(such as a panther) than to the tree itself.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, as a reaction to a static environment, turns down the
level of neural excitation so that a new stimulus (such as that
panther) stands out more. It's the neural equivalent of
extinguishing a porch light to see the fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   Sensory boredom has many uses. Ever notice how a foul-smelling
room loses its bite after a half-hour or so, even if you haven't
opened a window? That's because the excitation levels of olfactory
neurons, or smell receptors, decrease with each repeated
stimulation, so you notice the offensive odor less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Prove it to yourself with the following three experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slice a fresh onion in half, and hold it under your nose. The
first whiff will be pretty intense, but sniffs two, three, four and
five should become progressively milder, even though the onion
remains as potent from the first inhale to the last. (Keep tissue
handy for onion tears.)
</P>
<P>
   Continue long enough, and you might stop noticing the offending
vegetable altogether as your brain gets used to the odor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperature effects can also produce some amazing phenomena.
Grab a thermometer and three large bowls. Fill the first bowl with
cold water and ice, the second with water at room temperature
(roughly 70 degrees Fahrenheit), and the third with water hot
enough to be uncomfortable but not scalding (110 degrees Fahrenheit
will do the trick).
</P>
<P>
   Place your left hand in the cold bowl and your right hand in the
hot one. Leave both hands in the bowls for about 30 seconds. Then
place both hands in the room-temperature water. After about 30
seconds, the hand from the cold bowl will begin to feel warmer than
the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of hot and cold don't derive directly from
temperature but from the difference between the temperature your
thermal receptors have gotten used to and the warmth or coolness of
objects stimulating them. Since your right hand had adapted to the
hot water, the room-temperature water seemed cool by comparison,
while the reverse was true for your left hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary behavioral responses can also exhibit neurological
boredom. Sneak up on a friend and yell octopus in her ear, and
you'll get a startled reaction. But octopus your friend a few
minutes later, and you'll see much less of a jump (although some
other type of behavior may emerge).
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon, called habituation, takes place in the brain
but doesn't require a specific change in the behavior of sensory
nerves. Your friend hears the word octopus but doesn't jump,
because she's habituated.
</P>
<P>

sameness and the brain at www.discover.com/brainworks.

 &HT;    When Dow's a bull, investors get unbearable
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a good thing when the stock market plummets
like it did Friday because it shuts up some of these
self-proclaimed market experts for a couple of days. I get tired of
all these Dullionaires yapping about their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   If both Dow and Jones have to move into the Salvation Army,
that's OK with me as long as it stops the stockaholics around town
from running their gums about their earnings. Pick another subject.
Tell me about your dog. Tell me about your sex life. Share a chili
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sick of all these people talking about how to play the stock
market. Everywhere you go these days, people are giving financial
tips and yapping about how well off they are.
</P>
<P>
   In this Hawaiian shirt, do I look like I care?
</P>
<P>
   Why, just the other day at the gym downtown, a college-age gal
wearing a ``Theta'' shirt was explaining how the market works. It's
pretty simple, by her estimation. You buy stocks at $4, and they go
up to $8. That's it. ``I buy stocks at $4, and they go up to $8.''
That's what she was telling the gal riding the stair-stepping
machine next to her.
</P>
<P>
   No mention of ever buying stocks at $4 and them going down to
$2. You can hear me cheering when they drop to $2, because maybe
it'll thin out traffic on the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   One good thing about Smart Growth? It encourages developers to
build up, not out. That way, when the market goes completely into
the dumper, these people will have enough tall buildings to jump
out of. If you leap out of a two-story building after your 401(k)
turns up worthless, all it'll do is screw up your knees. So close
the window and sit down and find another subject to bore us with
besides your net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Dullionaire I was talking to at the gym over
the weekend. I mean, this guy was still blowing and going about his
market prowess after the Nasdaq had dropped nearly 10 percent the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever gotten in a conversation with a guy who crows
about how well off he is and you want to see him have to take in
ironing? This was one of those guys. He said he bought a bunch of
Dell stock, and it went up so much that he bought his house with
cash. He said the real estate people were real happy about that
because they didn't have to fill out any paperwork. He was sure to
emphasize that he drives a Porsche. This guy said he was doing so
well that he eats every meal out.
</P>
<P>
   That's great, I said, but my wife is a wonderful cook. ``Yeah,
well, my old lady's French,'' the Dullionaire shot back. Whatever
the heck that's supposed to mean.
</P>
<P>
   I hate people trying to impress me with their bank statements.
When I hear it, I want to say, ``OK, suit boy, if you're so well
off, write me a check for $10,000. Or at least take me to Ray's
Steak House for an appetizer.''
</P>
<P>
   You know those little numbers they run across the bottom of the
TV screen that show how much your stock is worth? I'm the kind of
guy who cheers when they get real small. I love it when Alan
Greenspan makes a speech. Go, Alan, go. Every time Alan shows up
running his mouth, a passel of annoying yuppies lose their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get any better than that.

 &HT;    Hop into our advice for the best-tasting chocolate bunny
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If you're hopping down the grocery trail looking
for the best-tasting chocolate Easter bunny, hippoty-hoppity, help
is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   To separate the standard-issue chocolate bunnies from those
truly worthy of a place in your Easter basket, we conducted a blind
taste test of 10 chocolate Easter bunnies. A panel of 15 chocolate
lovers carefully tasted each bunny to find the yummiest.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the bunnies were chocolate; one was a mixture of peanut
butter and chocolate. The taste-testers first compared the nine
chocolate bunnies. Once they had selected their winner, they
decided if they preferred their favorite chocolate bunny to the
peanut-butter version.
</P>
<P>
   The Reese's peanut-butter bunny won, with 10 of the tasters
choosing it over their favorite chocolate bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine purely chocolate bunnies, Dove chocolate stood above
the rest, receiving eight of the 15 votes. Palmer and Brach's tied
for second place, each garnering three votes, and Russell Stover
came in third.
</P>
<P>
   Though our taste-testers did not know what brands of chocolate
they were trying, a majority of them immediately recognized the
taste of the Hershey's bunny and the Reese's bunny.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we learned, though, is that one man's favorite
chocolate is another man's chocolate-bunny roadkill. Every bunny
had its supporters and detractors.
</P>
<P>
   So, to help you make an informed decision when you traverse the
grocery aisles lined with hundreds of chocolate bunnies, here are
comments from our taste-testers.

 &HT;    Let's boil up them crawfish
 &HT;    By Jana Collier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's only one way to eat a crawfish _ at a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Though they do have more legs than something you'd normally try
to eat, crawfish are easy to cook and make a great focus for any
outdoor party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole fun of the thing _ the atmosphere and
everything,'' said Mike Mayfield, who owns the seafood division of
Waco Custom Meats &AMP; Seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Broadfoot of Houston, a veteran crawfish boiler, agrees.
``You have to have a party for crawfish,'' he said. ``It's just so
much fun that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark and my brother-in-law, Chip Saegert, recently held a big
crawfish boil at Chip's Houston home. They boiled 160 pounds of
crawfish, along with corn, potatoes and mushrooms, for about 50 of
their friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of having a crawfish boil at your house,
here's a guide from Mark and Chip and the folks at Waco Custom
Meats &AMP; Seafood.
</P>
<P>
   THE CRAWFISH
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish season runs from January to June, but the prime time
for the crustaceans is April and May. That's when the supply is
greatest and the crawfish are biggest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the crawfish supply is significantly down nationwide,
primarily due to a poor yield in Louisiana. However, Waco Custom
Meats gets most of its crawfish from Texas farms, and those farms
are currently producing well, Mike said. How long those farms
continue to produce will depend on the heat and rain, he said,
noting that the price is up this year because of the low supply.
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish must be cooked live, so storing them properly is
crucial to a successful boil.
</P>
<P>
   At Waco Custom Meats &AMP; Seafood, which supplies crawfish to many
Central Texas restaurants, a special cooler was built just for
crawfish. The mudbugs should be kept at a temperature of 38 to 40
degrees _ cold enough to stay fresh, but not cold enough to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Chip bought their crawfish at a Houston grocery store a
few hours before their boil and stored them in ice chests until
time for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   To tell if a crawfish is alive or dead, pick it up before it's
cooked and look at the tail: If its tail droops when handled, it's
dead; if the tail curls under its body, its still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Some crawfish must be ``purged'' or cleaned before cooking, but
it isn't always necessary. Mike said most Texas farmers clean their
crawfish in aerated, fresh water tanks before shipping, so they do
not need to be purged. Crawfish that have not been cleaned, though,
will need to be purged to remove mud sediment, fish bait and other
impurities.
</P>
<P>
   To purge the crawfish, Mark said he rinses them first with clean
water and then sprinkles salt over them while still in the ice
chest.
</P>
<P>
   TURNING UP THE HEAT
</P>
<P>
   Most people boil their crawfish in propane-fired pots, which can
be bought at stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot. For smaller
amounts of crawfish, you can use a large stockpot on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the pot, fill it about a half to three-fourths full
of water and add plenty of spices. At Waco Custom Meats, they use
Chef Geoffrey Michael's Cajun Red seasoning and the ultra-hot Swamp
Fire seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said he uses a large bottle of Zatarain's liquid shrimp and
crab boil and half of a large bottle of powdered shrimp and crab
boil for each pot he boils. He also adds one to two sticks of
butter, which he says makes the crawfish easier to peel, and about
5 lemons, halved.
</P>
<P>
   Many people cook corn and potatoes with their crawfish. Mark
also adds mushrooms, and Sondra Waits of Waco Custom Meats &AMP;
Seafood said she's seen people add whole garlic cloves. Some people
also add onions.
</P>
<P>
   Sausage and shrimp can be cooked with the crawfish, which is
nice for those who don't care for crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said he puts his vegetables in a mesh lingerie bag. This
keeps the vegetables from floating up to the top where they can
sometimes get too spicy. Depending on the size of the potato
pieces, you might want to add those first to give them a little
extra time to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Once the water in the pot is boiling and the spices are added,
throw in the crawfish and vegetables. The crawfish should cook
about 15 minutes. After they've cooked, Mark turns off the heat to
let them soak for another 15 minutes before serving.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLACE
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish should be eaten outdoors _ they're way too messy for
inside.
</P>
<P>
   My brother-in-law Chip actually built two large tables to set up
on his deck. He made them taller than most tables, so people could
stand and eat their crawfish as they were poured out on a
tablecloth of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The eating area should be well-stocked with paper towels and
napkins and extra seasonings for those who like their crawfish very
spicy.
</P>
<P>
   Having tables set up outside makes cleanup easy. Once the
party's over, just remove the leftover food and newspapers and hose
down the tables and ground.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUNCHIES
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes crawfish, and, in particular, children are
often turned off by the idea of eating something that looks like
the star of last night's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   My 7-year-old Claire and 4-year-old Rachel finally tasted some
crawfish tails, but they certainly didn't eat enough to constitute
a meal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why many people add sausage or shrimp to the crawfish
pots. Chip and Mark also fried a turkey, which was a nice addition
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   My sister, Shannon Saegert, assembled a large table of crackers,
vegetable trays and dips, along with praline bars and
crawfish-shaped cutout cookies, iced with red icing and decorated
with silver dragees for eyes. In addition, Shannon's friend, Betty
Broadfoot (Mark's wife), baked a batch of crawfish bread that
turned out to be the biggest hit of the party.

 &HT;    Tasty crawfish recipes
 &HT;    By Jana Collier

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Here's a basic recipe for boiled crawfish from the
Texas Marine Advisory Service and the Texas A&AMP;M University Sea
Grant College Program.
</P>
<P>
   BOILED CRAWFISH
</P>
<P>
   12 to 15 pounds of live crawfish
</P>
<P>
   1 package (3 ounces) crab and shrimp boil mix
</P>
<P>
   1 cup salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-gallon stew pot, bring water, crab boil, salt and pepper
to a boil. Add crawfish and boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat
and let crawfish soak for 10 minutes. Soaking allows the meat to
absorb flavors, so don't shorten the soaking time. Drain and serve
immediately. Makes 4-5 servings.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe for crawfish bread was the hit of my sister and
brother-in-law's party. Betty Broadfoot made it, following a recipe
from chef Emeril's cookbook ``Every Day's a Party.'' Crawfish bread
is a popular food at New Orleans' annual Jazz Fest, and those who
had been to Jazz Fest proclaimed this recipe exactly like that
served at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFISH BREAD
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups warm water (about 110 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups bleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped yellow bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds peeled crawfish tails
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pound sharp cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Monterey Jack Cheese with jalapenos, grated
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine yeast, sugar and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in the bowl
of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the warm water. With
the mixer on low speed, beat the mixture for about 1 minute to
dissolve the yeast. If the yeast mixture doesn't begin to foam
after a few minutes, it means it's not active and you will have to
start over with fresher yeast.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and 1 teaspoon of the
salt. Add it 1/4 cup at a time to the yeast mixture, mixing on low
speed until the dough lightly comes together. Increase the speed to
medium and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides of the
bowl, forms a ball and starts to climb up the dough hook.
</P>
<P>
   Coat a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil.
Put the dough in the bowl and turn it to oil all sides. Cover the
bowl with plastic wrap, set aside in a warm, draft-free place and
let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
Add the onion, bell pepper, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and
the cayenne. Cook, stirring for 4 minutes. Add the crawfish and
cook, stirring, for 5 minutes until they are soft. Remove from the
heat, drain off any excess liquid from the pan and set aside to
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dough from the bowl and turn it onto a lightly
floured work surface. Push it down, then using your hands, pat it
out to flatten it. Pick it up, dust the work surface with flour and
return the dough to the work surface. Roll it out to a
20-by-15-inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cheese in a medium-size mixing bowl. Sprinkle half
of the cheese over the upper half of the rectangle of dough,
leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spoon the crawfish mixture evenly over
the cheese. Top with the remaining cheese. Fold the other half of
the dough up over the filling, forming a half-moon shape, and pinch
the edges tightly to seal completely. Fold the edges over, seal
securely, and then crimp. Carefully transfer the dough to a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper. With a sharp pointed knife, make
three slits on top, about 6 inches apart. Brush the surface of the
dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the kosher salt and
black pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm,
draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the plastic wrap and bake the bread until golden brown,
30 to 35 minutes. Let cool slightly. Cut crosswise into 12 equal
portions and serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a great recipe for leftover crawfish tails from my
sister, Shannon Saegert. If you don't have leftovers, you can buy
packages of frozen crawfish tails.
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFISH FETTUCINE
</P>
<P>
   2 onions
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch green onions
</P>
<P>
   1 bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 sticks butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds crawfish tails
</P>
<P>
   1 jar picante sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Velveeta
</P>
<P>
   1 cup half and half
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces Fettucine
</P>
<P>
   Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pepper and cayenne to taste
</P>
<P>
   Saute vegetables until soft. Add flour, parsley, crawfish and
spices. Cook 15 minutes. Add picante, Velveeta and half and half.
Cook fettucine separately and add to crawfish mixture. Top with
Parmesan cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This is another way to use leftover crawfish tails. If you don't
have leftovers, you can buy frozen bags.
</P>
<P>
   CRAWFISH CARDINAL
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons scallions
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   Salt, white pepper and red pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds crawfish tails
</P>
<P>
   Oven toasted and buttered French bread
</P>
<P>
   In large skillet, blend butter and flour, stirring two minutes.
Add scallions, milk and wine. Bring to a simmer. Stir in tomato
paste and seasonings. Add crawfish and simmer 10 minutes. Serve
over toasted, buttered French bread slices.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Food of New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, my sister served cookies cut into the shapes of
crabs and crawfish along with Southern Praline Bars. The crawfish
cookie cutter was really a lobster shape, but it worked perfectly
as a crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   CUTOUT COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup margarine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk or cream
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Cream butter. Beat in sugar. Beat in egg, milk and vanilla. Stir
in flour. Chill in freezer. Roll on slightly floured board to
1/8-inch thickness. Cut into shapes and place cookies on ungreased
cookie sheet. Bake 8 minutes at 360 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ICING
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons margarine, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/8- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Shake of salt
</P>
<P>
   Red food coloring
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk, or more
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup powdered sugar, or more
</P>
<P>
   Silver dragees for decorating
</P>
<P>
   Put margarine, vanilla, salt and food coloring in mixing bowl.
Add milk and powdered sugar. Beat on high with electric mixer until
creamy. Keep adding additional milk and powdered sugar until icing
is of a good spreading consistency. Spread on cooled cookies. Place
two silver dragees as eyes on each crab or crawfish shape. Allow to
dry before stacking.
</P>
<P>
   These Southern Praline Bars were delicious and easy to make. I
found the recipe in ``Talk About Good II, A Toast to Cajun Food,''
a cookbook by the Junior League of Lafeyette, La.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN PRALINE BARS
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups flour, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Melt shortening
in large sauce pan, then put remaining ingredients in and stir
well. Spread in 13-by-9-inch greased and floured pan. Bake at 350
degrees for 30 minutes. Cool slightly in pan, then cover with
Praline Frosting.
</P>
<P>
   PRALINE FROSTING
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners sugar
</P>
<P>
   chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter and brown sugar; add cream. While over heat, stir in
confectioners sugar and beat until smooth. Pour over warm cake and
top with chopped pecans. Cut into squares.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO EAT A CRAWFISH
</P>
<P>
   1. Hold the crawfish in your left hand, placing the head between
your thumb and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grab the tail with your right hand.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place your thumb under the ``belly'' of the tail and wrap
your forefinger over the top of the tail.
</P>
<P>
   4. Twist and pull. The tail should pop off.
</P>
<P>
   5. Peel off the first ``ring'' or so of the tail shell. Now you
should be able to extract the meat from the remaining shell.
</P>
<P>
   6. True cajuns also suck the spicy juice out of the head before
discarding it.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Experts debate benefits of beer
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Red wine is the alcohol source most famous for its
apparent ability to ward off certain types of heart disease. But
some researchers are suggesting that a cold beer every once in a
while has some health benefits of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects of beer consumption may not seem like the
biggest issue facing America, but there's plenty of drinking going
on, according to the beer industry. After soft drinks, coffee and
milk, beer is the most popular beverage in America. In 1998 alone,
Americans spent $60 billion on 196 million barrels of brew. The
average per capita consumption that year was 22.2 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Morris Chafetz, president of the Health Education Foundation
in Washington, D.C., says the health consequences of drinking beer
are no different than those of any other food product. There's the
potential for good and the potential for bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any substance, including water and oxygen,
that would be good for you if abused,'' Chafetz said. ``I've been
in the field 40 years. I've studied all over the world. I'm telling
you that moderate usage has many health benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate about the health benefits of beer was jump-started
this spring when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
launched an anti-milk campaign using the slogan ``Got Beer?'' The
campaign, which has since been pulled from college campuses after
protests from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, touts beer as
nutritionally superior to milk.
</P>
<P>
   PETA officials admit their real aim was to highlight what they
perceive as the cruel treatment of cows bred for commercial milk
production. To make their point, though, PETA officials sited
medical studies that suggest beer is not the bad beverage some
would have you think.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people in the medical profession don't buy PETA's
analysis, but Chafetz isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't suggest anyone go home tonight and pound a 12 pack,
but he says people who drink alcohol moderately _ including beer _
have fewer heart attacks and fewer debilitating strokes. There's
also the social aspect of moderate alcohol consumption, especially
for older adults, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it's the use of alcohol or the fact that they
can socialize better (because of the alcohol),'' Chafetz said.
``They're less depressed in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have believed for a number of years that the
antioxidants in red wine, called flavonoids, help counteract plaque
buildup in heart arteries. But some in the medical profession are
now saying that any type of alcohol is beneficial, not just red
wine.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Harvard Medical School, led by Dr. J. Michael
Gaziano, found that a drink or two a day can cut a person's risk of
having a heart attack in half. In the study, it did not matter what
type of alcohol people drank. Wine, beer and liquor were equally
effective.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gaziano, alcohol raises the body's level of HDL
(high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), the good cholesterol that
helps keep arteries free of dangerous buildups.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors surmise that people who drink red wine may see more
health benefits than beer drinkers because of their drinking
habits. People who drink red wine tend to have a glass or two in
the evening and don't binge, according to the study. Beer drinkers,
on the other hand, may average a drink a day, but that's only
because they're more likely to slam a six-pack Friday night after
drinking little to none during the week, Chafetz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study concluded that heart patients should not go
out of their way to drink for health reasons, but it's not
medically necessary for them to give up alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Cortes, a nutritionist with Providence Healthcare
Network, said there are some vitamins in beer and some studies
point to other benefits. But before indulging, people should think
about the negatives consequences as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's a personal choice,'' Cortes said. ``In
moderation, it probably won't harm their health, but they need to
consider that it could lead to addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Because beer is made from fermented grains, it provides B
vitamins. A 12-ounce can has about 9 percent of the recommended
daily dosage of vitamin B-6 and 9 percent of niacin. Cortes said
beer also contains trace minerals chromium and phosphorous, which
can help a person keep a healthy, stable metabolism. Niacin aides
in maintaining healthy nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these benefits, however, the alcohol in beer also
interferes with the body's ability to utilize some B vitamins,
vitamin C, zinc and magnesium.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, a person who drinks beer on a regular basis or
abuses it tends to develop nutrient deficiencies that can lead to
nerve damage or other problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janelle Walter, a professor of family and consumer science
at Baylor University, said there are plenty of food products that
can provide what little nutritional value comes in a 12-ounce can
of beer. The alcohol is not digested in the stomach, so the liver
is left to process what is treated as a toxin by the body. Heavy
alcohol use can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's really anything medically redeeming
about beer,'' Walter said. ``It has very little in it other than
alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's mainly water, but as Walter points out, the
alcohol is treated as a toxin by the body. To flush the toxins, the
body uses water. Drinking too much beer, then, can cause
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Beer, which is 11 percent alcohol by weight, also comes with a
lot of calories, about 150 per can. Alcohol has seven calories per
gram, compared to carbohydrates, which have four calories per gram.
Fat has nine calories per gram.
</P>
<P>
   That means if you cut back on the cold beer, you might also cut
down your waist size, Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, one problem we don't have is getting enough
calories in our diets,'' she said. ``Drinking beer is going to give
you weight problems.''
</P>
<P>
   PETA's campaign points out that beer has no fat or cholesterol.
Milk is ``loaded'' with fat and has 20 mg of cholesterol in every
8-ounce serving, according to PETA's studies. A can of beer also
has a half gram of fiber, 12 milligrams of sodium and three grams
of complex carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Chafetz said he does not condone the abuse of beer or any other
substance. Drinking and driving is bad, he said. Someone who
consumes so much alcohol that they lose control of their faculties
is drinking irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term effects of consumption are anything but bad,
he said. His studies, for example, show that only 10 percent of
chronic alcoholics have cirrhosis of the liver, meaning there is
little connection between alcohol and liver damage. He added that
while alcohol can impair judgment immediately after a person
drinks, there are no proven long-term negative effects on the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Whether people like it or not, he said, the reality is that beer
actually makes many people feel better, kind of like Prozac or
aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to people becoming addicted to beer or other
forms of alcohol, it's the person, not the substance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy jumps off a building and kills himself, we don't say,
'Why did we build the building?''' Chafetz said. ``We question why
the person was self-destructive.''

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the discussion about Confederate flags and symbols in
South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi, I haven't seen anything
about the flag situation in Arkansas, President Clinton's home
state. Is the Confederate flag flown over the Capitol in Little
Rock? Does the state flag include any Confederate symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Confederate flag isn't flown over the Capitol, said Renie
Rule of the Arkansas secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   The state flag does incorporate a symbol that nods at Arkansas'
Confederate history, but it's not conspicuous. The flag has a
diamond-shaped design bordered by a wide blue band. Within the band
are 25 stars signifying that Arkansas was the 25th state to enter
the Union. The word ARKANSAS is in the center of the flag, with one
star above it and three below. The book ``State Names, Seals, Flags
and Symbols: A Historical Guide'' cites a 1913 act of the Arkansas
Legislature, amended in 1923, stating that the star above the
letter ``R'' represents the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   As the act notes, from May 1, 1861, to May 23, 1865, Arkansas
was ``part of and under dominion of the Confederate States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've had the opportunity to see Elton John in several
concerts over the past few years. While performing, he drinks from
a can of Diet Coke. But I've also noticed that on occasion the
label has been blanked out so the name doesn't show. What's up with
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Diet Coke remains his drink of choice, insiders say. Even on
the occasions when the label isn't visible, it's still Diet Coke,
we're told. A fan who has attended all of Sir Elton's Atlanta
performances said he could recall the can being masked on only one
occasion: a private concert when the singer was hired by webMD to
perform for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the name Ku Klux Klan? It's an odd
combination of words and their spellings.
</P>
<P>
   A: It apparently comes from the Greek word kyklos, from which
comes the English word ``circle,'' plus Klan (clan), spelled with a
K for the sake of alliteration. The KKK was formed as a social club
by a group of Confederate Army veterans in Pulaski, Tenn., in the
1860s. Although it was disbanded in 1869, local branches remained
active for another few years. It has revived and declined several
times since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do other countries conduct census surveys on a regular basis?
What's the history of the census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States is by no means the only country counting
its residents. In fact the United Nations, which encourages all
nations to conduct complete, periodic censuses, publishes manuals
of recommended census procedures and works to establishes standards
so it can collect accurate world statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Early censuses date to ancient Rome. In 1086, 20 years after
William the Conqueror defeated England, his officials enumerated
the country's land, people and property in the Domesday Book.
</P>
<P>
   The first modern census _ one that was complete, direct and
periodic _ was conducted by the United States in 1790. Britain has
conducted a modern census every year since 1801, except in 1941,
during World War II. France took its first modern census in 1836.
Others following included Belgium, 1846; Italy, 1861; Germany,
1871; India, 1871-72; Russia and Egypt, 1897; and Japan, 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of John Hinckley, the man who shot President
Ronald Reagan? Is he still in jail?
</P>
<P>
   A: John W. Hinckley Jr. isn't in jail. Since he was found by a
jury to be not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of
Reagan and three others in 1981, he has been locked up at St.
Elizabeths Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There's a recent development in the case, however, that is
continuing to evolve. Hospital officials are recommending that
Hinckley, 44, be granted ``conditional release'' for unsupervised
visits with his parents on one weekend day each week. The parents
live within the 50-mile radius of the hospital, required as one
element of the conditional release. Over the past six months,
Hinckley has visited several Washington-area shopping malls,
restaurants and bookstores under the supervision of hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office, which opposes the hospital
officials' plans, has asked Senior U.S. District Judge June Green
for a hearing. Green has expressed skepticism over the years about
claims that Hinckley is making progress.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent essay in Time, Patti Davis vigorously opposed the
proposed brief releases of the man who shot her father. She asks:
``Is Hinckley less insane now? Is he no longer violent?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura offered any public opinion
on the South Carolina flag controversy?
</P>
<P>
   A: The subject came up in February on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
when three govenors _ Ventura, an independent; Roy Barnes of
Georgia, a Democrat; and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican _
were asked if they favored removing the emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura declined to comment. Following his lead, Barnes said,
``I think it's wrong for all of us who are outside to go in and
give advice.'' Ridge endorsed removing the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A small creek runs behind our home. With the possibility of
water restrictions looming again this summer, I'm wondering: Is
there any danger in using this creek water, which probably includes
runoff from yards and subdivision storm drains, to irrigate our
family vegetable garden?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the stream is fast-flowing, it probably will be safe to
use it for that purpose. But if it's sluggish, like it would be
during a drought, anything coming from runoff would be concentrated
and shouldn't be used. If you decide that the creek is flowing fast
enough for the water to be acceptable, it is recommended that you
irrigate from it in the middle of the week, because people tend to
put out pesticides on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip: Don't use the creek water as an irrigation source
right after a rain, when the runoff is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While we were touring the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, we
were told that the Vehicle Assembly Building is one of the largest
in the world in cubic feet. What's larger?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Kennedy Space Center says the building encloses 129.4
million cubic feet of space. The Boeing Co.'s factory building in
Everett, Wash., is considerably larger, with a volume of 472
million cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, consider the Pentagon, which is often called the
largest office building in the world: It has a volume of 77 million
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) some years ago
said she celebrated her birthday with several cakes, one of which
was decorated with a ``black flag.'' What is a black flag?
</P>
<P>
   A: A red, black and green flag symbolizing African nationhood
was adopted in 1920 by the Universal Negro Improvement Association
and African Communities League. Many African nations chose those
same colors later for their national flags, but the 1920 version _
credited to Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the UNIA-ACL _ is said to be
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey followers said red was chosen to represent ``the blood
which men must shed for their redemption and liberty,'' green ``for
the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland,'' and black for ``the
color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the flag can be found online at
http://unia-acl.org/history/flagstore.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has the U.S. government been counting heads for a
census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first U.S. census began on Aug. 2, 1790, and lasted about
18 months. Enumerators on horseback had to ride through the
countryside to count most of the population. Many people refused to
cooperate, because they didn't know why the government needed
information about them (some things haven't changed, have they?).
</P>
<P>
   When the tally was complete, it showed the nation had a
population of 3,893,874.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that a barrel of crude oil contains 42
gallons. How many gallons of gasoline would be refined from that
same barrel of oil?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because of the reduction in density of many crude components
during processing, that 42 gallons yields 44 gallons of
``finished'' refinery products, of which gasoline amounts to 19 1/2
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder (in gallons): distillate fuel oil, 8.61; jet fuel,
4.20; residual fuel oil, 2.77; petroleum coke, 1.60 gallons;
asphalt and road oils, 1.39; liquified gases, 1.43; petrochemical
feedstocks, 1.22; miscellaneous, 2.98; finished aviation gasoline,
0.08; and kerosene, 0.25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Q&AMP;A item about salary and perks of members of
Congress cited the National Taxpayers Union as the source of
information. I'm very interested, because I think what Congress
members get is outrageous. I never heard of the Taxpayers Union
before. What does it do, and how can I get more information about
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an advocacy group that calls itself ``the (nation's)
largest grass-roots taxpayer organization, with more than 300,000
members across all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1969, the organization says it works for
constitutional amendments to curtail deficit spending and restrict
tax increases; lower taxes for all people; ensure taxpayer rights;
eliminate wasteful and inefficient government spending; reduce
spending, bureaucracy and regulation at all levels of government;
and require accountability from elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Information: National Taxpayers Union, 108 N. Alfred St.,
Alexandria, VA 22314 (703-683-5700), or online at www.ntu.org.

<P>
   Q: I recently vacationed in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and saw many
restaurants advertising ``Calabash seafood buffet.'' What do they
mean by ``Calabash''? How is that different from any other seafood?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calabash is a fishing village just across the North Carolina
line, about 25 miles from Myrtle Beach. As Stephen Greene of the
Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce explains, restaurants in
Calabash started a tradition of deep-frying locally caught fish,
crabs, shrimp and oysters in a lightly seasoned cornmeal batter and
serving them _ along with home-style vegetables, hot breads, pies
and cobblers _ in an all-you-can-eat buffet. The concept was so
popular thatrestaurants in Myrtle Beach began to copy it, bringing
it to both sides of the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Washington Post had an article April 5 about an
adventurer who planned to fly a World War II-era open cockpit plane
to the North Pole. The plane was to depart that day from
Gaithersburg, Md. Can you update me on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The project started on schedule when the pilot, Gustavus
McLeod, took off from Gaithersburg in his own plane, a 1939 Boeing
PT-17 Stearman. If successful, he will be the first person to pilot
an open-cockpit plane to the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod's 3,500-mile itinerary, which originally was to take 12
days: Hamilton, Elliot Lake, Jerraldton Lake and Pickle Lake, in
Ontario; Church Hill, in Manitoba; Rankin Inlet, Taloyuak, Resolute
and Weather Station Eureka, in Nunavut; 86 degrees north latitude
(ice caps); 90 degrees latitude (geographic North Pole).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenberg, McLeod's spokesman in Alexandria, Va., told Q&AMP;A
April 12 that the pilot had encountered a problem ``with a $1.50
gasket throwing the flight off for another day or so.'' The trouble
occurred when the temperature suddenly dropped from 9 degrees below
zero to 26 below on the leg between Pickle Lake and Churchill. The
gasket broke, with oil leaking from the engine.
</P>
<P>
   As of that afternoon, McLeod was awaiting a new gasket to be
delivered from Oklahoma City. If it worked, and a short test flight
was successful, Rosenberg said, McLeod's quest would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
   News releases are posted online at www.northpole2000.com.
National Geographic is filming the project for a future TV special,
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the U.S. government footing the bills for flights, lodging
and meals incurred in connection with Elian Gonzales' father and
the rest of the Cuban entourage being in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. A State Department representative said all costs involved
are being paid by the Cuban government. The only role played by the
United States was to facilitate arrangements, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV show said Easter began as a pagan holiday in orchards or
groves and consisted of fertility rituals. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't know about the orchards and groves, but it did have
pagan beginnings associated with fertility. While the origin of the
English name Easter is uncertain, some scholars trace it to Eastre,
the Anglo-Saxon goddess who presided over the vernal equinox.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient spring festivals had a resurrection theme _ new life
afer the winter _ and fertility obviously played a part, which
explains how eggs came to be included as symbols. Another symbol
that evolved was the hare, symbol of fertility in ancient Egypt,
which in North America was replaced by the Easter bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to be in California in July. Do you know the date and
site of this year's U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you hope to be a spectator, you'll need to move your trip
up a bit. The tournament will be June 15-18 at Pebble Beach Golf
Links in Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The test dummies used in automobile crash testing could weigh
as little as 10-15 pounds. But to be realistic, shouldn't they be
much heavier, say in the 180-pound range?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dummies with the weight you mention are intended to simulate
children. But in fact the dummies cover a much wider range. Those
manufactured by Applied Safety Technologies Corp., for instance,
range from a newborn infant to what's termed a 95th percentile
male. Sample weights: Hybrid II 6-year-old child, 33.3 pounds;
Hybrid II 50th percentile male, 164 pounds; Hybrid III 5th
percentile female, 106-110 pounds; and Hybrid III 95th percentile
male, 223.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The dummies simulate what happens to a human inside a vehicle
when a crash occurs, and have evolved into quite realistic
``people.'' One of the newest is the Hybrid III 5th percentile
female, made of vinyl and stainless steel and dressed in
fashion-forward Capri-length pants with a form-fitting cotton knit
top and military-issue size 8W shoes. She is stuffed with
instruments so researchers can determine what might happen in a
crash involving a typical small female. Her cost is an estimated
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dummies' specifications are mandated by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. They are intended to gauge head,
neck, chest, spine, leg and other injuries both from impact and
from air bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed information on Applied Safety Technologies' ``human
surrogates'' can be found online at www.astc.net. Other companies
also make crash test dummies, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While watching the Masters on TV, I noticed that several
golfers were violating what I consider one of golf's oldest
customs, which is the wearing of a collared golf shirt. David
Duval, specifically, could be seen wearing a crew neck. Is that now
permissible at Augusta National Golf Club?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no policy requiring collared shirts, said Augusta
National's Glenn Greenspan. The only dress code requirement of the
PGA Tour is long pants on players, he added, and that's the
guideline used at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who invented the VCR, and how did it develop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The concept was the brainchild of independent American
inventor Jerome H. Lemelson (1923-97), who amassed more than 500
patents, including essential parts of the camcorder, cordless
telephone, fax machine, data- and word-processing systems, and
industrial robots.
</P>
<P>
   While the development of videotape recorders began in the 1940s,
the first such device capable of recording a television picture of
broadcasting quality on magnetic tape didn't come along until 1956.
That recorder, developed by Charles P. Ginsberg, Charles E.
Anderson and Ray Dolby, and manufactured by the Ampex Corp. of
Redwood City, Calif., was demonstrated simultaneously in Redwood
City and Chicago on April 14, 1956. The first tape, 2 inches wide,
moved at a speed of 15 inches per second; a single 14-inch reel
accommodated a 65-minute recording.
</P>
<P>
   VCRs as we know them today evolved soon afterward. Japan's Sony
Corp. marketed the first open-reel videotape recorder for home use,
the TCV-2010, in 1966. It required a separate camera, set up on a
tripod, and a separate microphone to record sound. The Betamax,
which was sold in the United States by Sony, followed in 1975. It
was built into a console that also contained a Sony color TV set.
The tape was contained in a plastic cassette to make it easy to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   NRA video: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the National Rifle
Association's online video about gun control laws in Australia,
saying it apparently had been removed from the NRA's Web site
(www.nra.org). But the video still can be viewed online at
NRA-Live, a subset of the Web site that requires Shockwave
software. The Shockwave requirement can be bypassed, however, by
using this address:
http://nraila.org/research/20000329-BanningGuns-001.shtml. It
contains a link to the Australia video and other videos and should
work for most Internet users.

 &HT;    Reiner proud of accomplishments
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Carl Reiner is proud of many things, and he'll
gladly talk about all of them. But ask him about his son, Rob, and
he won't shut up. Ask him about World War II, and you'll be there
forever. Not that you'd mind.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Reiner, 78, sat for a while to talk about his
54-year career, Mel Brooks, comedy today, his role in ``Gidget Goes
Hawaiian'' _ as well as son Rob and WWII.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote (the `The Dick Van Dyke Show') for myself,'' he said.
``I was in the role Dick Van Dyke eventually played. Nobody would
buy it. And that's the best thing that ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was recast a year later with Van Dyke in the lead and
Reiner as head writer, making cameo appearances as Alan Brady, Van
Dyke's tyrannical, egomaniacal boss. The show became a huge hit,
running from 1961 to 1966 and providing Reiner with seven of his 12
Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That show hasn't been off the air since it first started,''
Reiner said, with Nick at Night and TVLand picking up where
syndication left off. It's the achievement Reiner says he's most
proud of, ``mainly because without that show I wouldn't be here
today, and I got enough money to buy a house. It's on Rodeo Drive,
and I still live in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He muses about the 2,000-Year-Old Man, a comedy classic that
Reiner and Mel Brooks _ a friend and fellow writer for ``Your Show
of Shows'' _ ``did for fun, at parties. We never dreamed of putting
in on a record,'' Reiner recalled. ``We'd been doing it for years.
I'd be the interviewer, and he never knew where I'd put him. I'd
make him a submarine captain, an artist ... I always tried to put
him to the wall, but the more panicked he got, the funnier he
became.''
</P>
<P>
   A party attended by Hollywood's elite finally got the routine on
the road to a recording: ``George Burns said if we didn't record
it, he'd steal it,'' Reiner laughed. ``Edward G. Robinson wanted to
take it to Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   An update of the schtick, ``The 2,000-Year-Old Man in the Year
2,000,'' won a Grammy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for today's comedy, Reiner sees comics as simply doing their
job: ``Comedy changes as the world changes,'' he said. ``Society
changes and comedians notice it, and they're the ones pointing it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name one project he wishes he'd avoided, Reiner rubs
his face and begins to weave the tale of ``Gidget Goes Hawaiian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered me this thing, and I said, `No! It's a horrible
script.' They offered me more money and I still wouldn't do it.
Then they said they were doing it in Hawaii ... I hadn't been there
since the war. Television wasn't doing much with movies those days,
and I figured nobody I knew would ever see it. So I went. I played
Gidget's father. It's a terrible picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I keep getting letters from people who catch that thing
on television.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Hawaii gave Reiner a chance to revisit his old war
haunts. He was an Air Force radio operator and a teletype operator
in the Signal Corps before being assigned to Maurice Evans' Special
Services Entertainment Unit, touring the South Pacific in a G.I.
revue.
</P>
<P>
   World War II was an amazing time to be alive, Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew we had to be a part of that war. Somehow we all
knew there was something terrible going on, even if people didn't
know the subtleties of what would happen if we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner was given relatively safe assignments: His brother, he
said, ``was assigned to all the places that would kill him. Omaha
Beach, Sicily, North Africa ... He was in 11 major battles and came
out alive. In war, the best thing to be is lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his oldest son, Rob, Reiner pays perfunctory homage to
the show-biz achievements _ acting (``All in the Family'') and
directing (``The Princess Bride,'' ``Spinal Tap'') _ before
launching into a passionate discourse on Proposition 10, a
California law that taxes cigarettes and uses the funds for health,
nutrition and child care for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened the New York Times yesterday and there's a picture of
my son,'' Reiner said. ``It was a story about using celebrities to
further causes. Usually the causes are already in place: Rob's is
the only example of someone who took his own idea and built on it
... He took two years of his life to research and work for that. He
says going back to making movies will be like playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner gets together with friends from the early days of his
career, including Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get together once or twice a week, watch movies and ball
games,'' he smiled. ``We're just like anybody else. At our age, we
like to talk about our health and our grandchildren.''

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the discussion about Confederate flags and symbols in
South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi, I haven't seen anything
about the flag situation in Arkansas, President Clinton's home
state. Is the Confederate flag flown over the Capitol in Little
Rock? Does the state flag include any Confederate symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Confederate flag isn't flown over the Capitol, said Renie
Rule of the Arkansas secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   The state flag does incorporate a symbol that nods at Arkansas'
Confederate history, but it's not conspicuous. The flag has a
diamond-shaped design bordered by a wide blue band. Within the band
are 25 stars signifying that Arkansas was the 25th state to enter
the Union. The word ARKANSAS is in the center of the flag, with one
star above it and three below. The book ``State Names, Seals, Flags
and Symbols: A Historical Guide'' cites a 1913 act of the Arkansas
Legislature, amended in 1923, stating that the star above the
letter ``R'' represents the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   As the act notes, from May 1, 1861, to May 23, 1865, Arkansas
was ``part of and under dominion of the Confederate States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've had the opportunity to see Elton John in several
concerts over the past few years. While performing, he drinks from
a can of Diet Coke. But I've also noticed that on occasion the
label has been blanked out so the name doesn't show. What's up with
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Diet Coke remains his drink of choice, insiders say. Even on
the occasions when the label isn't visible, it's still Diet Coke,
we're told. A fan who has attended all of Sir Elton's Atlanta
performances said he could recall the can being masked on only one
occasion: a private concert when the singer was hired by webMD to
perform for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the name Ku Klux Klan? It's an odd
combination of words and their spellings.
</P>
<P>
   A: It apparently comes from the Greek word kyklos, from which
comes the English word ``circle,'' plus Klan (clan), spelled with a
K for the sake of alliteration. The KKK was formed as a social club
by a group of Confederate Army veterans in Pulaski, Tenn., in the
1860s. Although it was disbanded in 1869, local branches remained
active for another few years. It has revived and declined several
times since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do other countries conduct census surveys on a regular basis?
What's the history of the census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States is by no means the only country counting
its residents. In fact the United Nations, which encourages all
nations to conduct complete, periodic censuses, publishes manuals
of recommended census procedures and works to establishes standards
so it can collect accurate world statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Early censuses date to ancient Rome. In 1086, 20 years after
William the Conqueror defeated England, his officials enumerated
the country's land, people and property in the Domesday Book.
</P>
<P>
   The first modern census _ one that was complete, direct and
periodic _ was conducted by the United States in 1790. Britain has
conducted a modern census every year since 1801, except in 1941,
during World War II. France took its first modern census in 1836.
Others following included Belgium, 1846; Italy, 1861; Germany,
1871; India, 1871-72; Russia and Egypt, 1897; and Japan, 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of John Hinckley, the man who shot President
Ronald Reagan? Is he still in jail?
</P>
<P>
   A: John W. Hinckley Jr. isn't in jail. Since he was found by a
jury to be not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of
Reagan and three others in 1981, he has been locked up at St.
Elizabeths Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There's a recent development in the case, however, that is
continuing to evolve. Hospital officials are recommending that
Hinckley, 44, be granted ``conditional release'' for unsupervised
visits with his parents on one weekend day each week. The parents
live within the 50-mile radius of the hospital, required as one
element of the conditional release. Over the past six months,
Hinckley has visited several Washington-area shopping malls,
restaurants and bookstores under the supervision of hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office, which opposes the hospital
officials' plans, has asked Senior U.S. District Judge June Green
for a hearing. Green has expressed skepticism over the years about
claims that Hinckley is making progress.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent essay in Time, Patti Davis vigorously opposed the
proposed brief releases of the man who shot her father. She asks:
``Is Hinckley less insane now? Is he no longer violent?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura offered any public opinion
on the South Carolina flag controversy?
</P>
<P>
   A: The subject came up in February on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
when three govenors _ Ventura, an independent; Roy Barnes of
Georgia, a Democrat; and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican _
were asked if they favored removing the emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura declined to comment. Following his lead, Barnes said,
``I think it's wrong for all of us who are outside to go in and
give advice.'' Ridge endorsed removing the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A small creek runs behind our home. With the possibility of
water restrictions looming again this summer, I'm wondering: Is
there any danger in using this creek water, which probably includes
runoff from yards and subdivision storm drains, to irrigate our
family vegetable garden?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the stream is fast-flowing, it probably will be safe to
use it for that purpose. But if it's sluggish, like it would be
during a drought, anything coming from runoff would be concentrated
and shouldn't be used. If you decide that the creek is flowing fast
enough for the water to be acceptable, it is recommended that you
irrigate from it in the middle of the week, because people tend to
put out pesticides on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip: Don't use the creek water as an irrigation source
right after a rain, when the runoff is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While we were touring the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, we
were told that the Vehicle Assembly Building is one of the largest
in the world in cubic feet. What's larger?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Kennedy Space Center says the building encloses 129.4
million cubic feet of space. The Boeing Co.'s factory building in
Everett, Wash., is considerably larger, with a volume of 472
million cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, consider the Pentagon, which is often called the
largest office building in the world: It has a volume of 77 million
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) some years ago
said she celebrated her birthday with several cakes, one of which
was decorated with a ``black flag.'' What is a black flag?
</P>
<P>
   A: A red, black and green flag symbolizing African nationhood
was adopted in 1920 by the Universal Negro Improvement Association
and African Communities League. Many African nations chose those
same colors later for their national flags, but the 1920 version _
credited to Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the UNIA-ACL _ is said to be
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey followers said red was chosen to represent ``the blood
which men must shed for their redemption and liberty,'' green ``for
the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland,'' and black for ``the
color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the flag can be found online at
http://unia-acl.org/history/flagstore.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has the U.S. government been counting heads for a
census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first U.S. census began on Aug. 2, 1790, and lasted about
18 months. Enumerators on horseback had to ride through the
countryside to count most of the population. Many people refused to
cooperate, because they didn't know why the government needed
information about them (some things haven't changed, have they?).
</P>
<P>
   When the tally was complete, it showed the nation had a
population of 3,893,874.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that a barrel of crude oil contains 42
gallons. How many gallons of gasoline would be refined from that
same barrel of oil?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because of the reduction in density of many crude components
during processing, that 42 gallons yields 44 gallons of
``finished'' refinery products, of which gasoline amounts to 19 1/2
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder (in gallons): distillate fuel oil, 8.61; jet fuel,
4.20; residual fuel oil, 2.77; petroleum coke, 1.60 gallons;
asphalt and road oils, 1.39; liquified gases, 1.43; petrochemical
feedstocks, 1.22; miscellaneous, 2.98; finished aviation gasoline,
0.08; and kerosene, 0.25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Q&AMP;A item about salary and perks of members of
Congress cited the National Taxpayers Union as the source of
information. I'm very interested, because I think what Congress
members get is outrageous. I never heard of the Taxpayers Union
before. What does it do, and how can I get more information about
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an advocacy group that calls itself ``the (nation's)
largest grass-roots taxpayer organization, with more than 300,000
members across all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1969, the organization says it works for
constitutional amendments to curtail deficit spending and restrict
tax increases; lower taxes for all people; ensure taxpayer rights;
eliminate wasteful and inefficient government spending; reduce
spending, bureaucracy and regulation at all levels of government;
and require accountability from elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Information: National Taxpayers Union, 108 N. Alfred St.,
Alexandria, VA 22314 (703-683-5700), or online at www.ntu.org.

<P>
   Q: I recently vacationed in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and saw many
restaurants advertising ``Calabash seafood buffet.'' What do they
mean by ``Calabash''? How is that different from any other seafood?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calabash is a fishing village just across the North Carolina
line, about 25 miles from Myrtle Beach. As Stephen Greene of the
Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce explains, restaurants in
Calabash started a tradition of deep-frying locally caught fish,
crabs, shrimp and oysters in a lightly seasoned cornmeal batter and
serving them _ along with home-style vegetables, hot breads, pies
and cobblers _ in an all-you-can-eat buffet. The concept was so
popular thatrestaurants in Myrtle Beach began to copy it, bringing
it to both sides of the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Washington Post had an article April 5 about an
adventurer who planned to fly a World War II-era open cockpit plane
to the North Pole. The plane was to depart that day from
Gaithersburg, Md. Can you update me on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The project started on schedule when the pilot, Gustavus
McLeod, took off from Gaithersburg in his own plane, a 1939 Boeing
PT-17 Stearman. If successful, he will be the first person to pilot
an open-cockpit plane to the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod's 3,500-mile itinerary, which originally was to take 12
days: Hamilton, Elliot Lake, Jerraldton Lake and Pickle Lake, in
Ontario; Church Hill, in Manitoba; Rankin Inlet, Taloyuak, Resolute
and Weather Station Eureka, in Nunavut; 86 degrees north latitude
(ice caps); 90 degrees latitude (geographic North Pole).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenberg, McLeod's spokesman in Alexandria, Va., told Q&AMP;A
April 12 that the pilot had encountered a problem ``with a $1.50
gasket throwing the flight off for another day or so.'' The trouble
occurred when the temperature suddenly dropped from 9 degrees below
zero to 26 below on the leg between Pickle Lake and Churchill. The
gasket broke, with oil leaking from the engine.
</P>
<P>
   As of that afternoon, McLeod was awaiting a new gasket to be
delivered from Oklahoma City. If it worked, and a short test flight
was successful, Rosenberg said, McLeod's quest would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
   News releases are posted online at www.northpole2000.com.
National Geographic is filming the project for a future TV special,
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the U.S. government footing the bills for flights, lodging
and meals incurred in connection with Elian Gonzales' father and
the rest of the Cuban entourage being in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. A State Department representative said all costs involved
are being paid by the Cuban government. The only role played by the
United States was to facilitate arrangements, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV show said Easter began as a pagan holiday in orchards or
groves and consisted of fertility rituals. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't know about the orchards and groves, but it did have
pagan beginnings associated with fertility. While the origin of the
English name Easter is uncertain, some scholars trace it to Eastre,
the Anglo-Saxon goddess who presided over the vernal equinox.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient spring festivals had a resurrection theme _ new life
afer the winter _ and fertility obviously played a part, which
explains how eggs came to be included as symbols. Another symbol
that evolved was the hare, symbol of fertility in ancient Egypt,
which in North America was replaced by the Easter bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to be in California in July. Do you know the date and
site of this year's U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you hope to be a spectator, you'll need to move your trip
up a bit. The tournament will be June 15-18 at Pebble Beach Golf
Links in Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The test dummies used in automobile crash testing could weigh
as little as 10-15 pounds. But to be realistic, shouldn't they be
much heavier, say in the 180-pound range?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dummies with the weight you mention are intended to simulate
children. But in fact the dummies cover a much wider range. Those
manufactured by Applied Safety Technologies Corp., for instance,
range from a newborn infant to what's termed a 95th percentile
male. Sample weights: Hybrid II 6-year-old child, 33.3 pounds;
Hybrid II 50th percentile male, 164 pounds; Hybrid III 5th
percentile female, 106-110 pounds; and Hybrid III 95th percentile
male, 223.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The dummies simulate what happens to a human inside a vehicle
when a crash occurs, and have evolved into quite realistic
``people.'' One of the newest is the Hybrid III 5th percentile
female, made of vinyl and stainless steel and dressed in
fashion-forward Capri-length pants with a form-fitting cotton knit
top and military-issue size 8W shoes. She is stuffed with
instruments so researchers can determine what might happen in a
crash involving a typical small female. Her cost is an estimated
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dummies' specifications are mandated by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. They are intended to gauge head,
neck, chest, spine, leg and other injuries both from impact and
from air bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed information on Applied Safety Technologies' ``human
surrogates'' can be found online at www.astc.net. Other companies
also make crash test dummies, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While watching the Masters on TV, I noticed that several
golfers were violating what I consider one of golf's oldest
customs, which is the wearing of a collared golf shirt. David
Duval, specifically, could be seen wearing a crew neck. Is that now
permissible at Augusta National Golf Club?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no policy requiring collared shirts, said Augusta
National's Glenn Greenspan. The only dress code requirement of the
PGA Tour is long pants on players, he added, and that's the
guideline used at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who invented the VCR, and how did it develop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The concept was the brainchild of independent American
inventor Jerome H. Lemelson (1923-97), who amassed more than 500
patents, including essential parts of the camcorder, cordless
telephone, fax machine, data- and word-processing systems, and
industrial robots.
</P>
<P>
   While the development of videotape recorders began in the 1940s,
the first such device capable of recording a television picture of
broadcasting quality on magnetic tape didn't come along until 1956.
That recorder, developed by Charles P. Ginsberg, Charles E.
Anderson and Ray Dolby, and manufactured by the Ampex Corp. of
Redwood City, Calif., was demonstrated simultaneously in Redwood
City and Chicago on April 14, 1956. The first tape, 2 inches wide,
moved at a speed of 15 inches per second; a single 14-inch reel
accommodated a 65-minute recording.
</P>
<P>
   VCRs as we know them today evolved soon afterward. Japan's Sony
Corp. marketed the first open-reel videotape recorder for home use,
the TCV-2010, in 1966. It required a separate camera, set up on a
tripod, and a separate microphone to record sound. The Betamax,
which was sold in the United States by Sony, followed in 1975. It
was built into a console that also contained a Sony color TV set.
The tape was contained in a plastic cassette to make it easy to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   NRA video: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the National Rifle
Association's online video about gun control laws in Australia,
saying it apparently had been removed from the NRA's Web site
(www.nra.org). But the video still can be viewed online at
NRA-Live, a subset of the Web site that requires Shockwave
software. The Shockwave requirement can be bypassed, however, by
using this address:
http://nraila.org/research/20000329-BanningGuns-001.shtml. It
contains a link to the Australia video and other videos and should
work for most Internet users.

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: Finally, a WCW pay-per-view that clicks
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first pay-per-view of the WCW's Vince Russo-Eric Bischoff
era, ``Spring Stampede,'' was a hit by most accounts. The show had
good action, but better than that, the story lines actually came
off as planned and carried over into Monday's show _ momentum that
WCW pay-per-views haven't been able to achieve lately.
</P>
<P>
   The premise was that all titles were up for grabs. Jeff Jarrett
beat Diamond Dallas Page for the world title, Scott Steiner beat
Sting for the U.S. title, Terry Funk won the hardcore title, Chris
Candido won the cruiserweight title and Shane Douglas and Buff
Bagwell won the tournament for the tag team title.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great show considering Russo and Bischoff had only one
week to change the lineup and build some heat into the matches.
Sting's story line carried into Monday's ``Nitro,'' which was
another solid effort and could continue to pull viewers away from
WWF's ``Raw is War.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of viewers, Russo is talking about moving ``Nitro''
back to the 9-11 p.m. slot on Monday nights to compete head-to-head
with ``Raw.'' It's much too premature for that. ``Nitro'' needs to
get its ratings back in the 4.5 range. Last week ``Raw'' had a
6.2-to-3.1 advantage, down from the previous week's 6.9-2.5.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to ratings, the WWF is reporting 875,000 buys
for its ``Wrestlemania 2000'' pay-per-view. That's approximately 15
times as many buys as the WCW ``Uncensored'' pay-per-view. Despite
this, wwf.com has a survey for viewers to fill out because, ``The
World Wrestling Federation is always trying to improve the quality
of its Pay-Per-Views. You can help us achieve that goal by taking a
few moments to complete this brief survey.'' The survey wants to
know which show you ordered, if you had any problems ordering and
if you were satisfied with the show. But it also asks for your
name, address and e-mail. Is this for consumer relations or just to
sell your information to telemarketers?
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of misleading, wcw.com had a link on their site
titled ``April 17th - Madden: Goldberg Returns!'' Goldberg was not
at Spring Stampede or Nitro and on Monday the link said ``...Sorry,
Goldberg Didn't Arrive!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lot of talk this week about two WCW wrestlers seemingly headed
in different directions: the troubled Scott Hall and the in-demand
Mike Awesome. A handful of wrestlers are rumored to have talked to
Eric Bischoff about firing Hall. Although Bischoff has on-air
control, Brad Siegel has the power over WCW contracts at the
moment, so don't expect anything to happen soon. Meanwhile, Mike
Awesome's move from ECW has been full of intrigue. Last Monday at
his debut, Bischoff ordered Awesome to renounce his ECW world title
and trash the ECW before destroying Kevin Nash. After a
conversation with former ECW stars Shane Douglas and Bam Bam
Bigelow, he did neither, which did not endear him to his new boss.
In the midst of all this, there was Awesome back in an ECW ring on
Thursday to lose his title to none other than the wrestler who gave
him his title when he left the ECW, current WWF wrestler Tazz. Why
two former ECW wrestlers were there to settle the ECW's issue is
beyond me. Before an overflow crowd in Indianapolis, Tazz beat
Awesome for the belt thanks to help from Tommy Dreamer. Expect Tazz
to give the belt to Dreamer soon.
</P>
<P>
   _ One person who will not miss Awesome is Spike Dudley. Here's
what Dudley had to say via his web site, spikedudley.net: ``Without
getting into too much detail let me say this. I busted my (butt)
for three months, literally busted my leg and will sit out close to
a year in order to get a guy that signed a three-year deal with my
company over. That person walked out without any warning or without
thought towards the people that put him into a position to leave. I
wish I could say it didn't bother me, but it does. Call me
narrow-minded for putting my morals in front of my checkbook. All I
can do is speak for myself and say that after what Paul E. and ECW
has done for me I couldn't imagine walking out on them with such
little class or dignity. On the other hand, I never thought
(Awesome) was that good and his departure will not 'hurt' ECW in
any way (trust me, I know).''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bret Hart's new book, ``The best there is, The best there was,
The best there ever will be,'' was released last week. Initial
reports are the book sold more copies in its first week than than
DDP's.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Macho Man'' Randy Savage was sighted backstage at a recent
WCW house show. Rumor is he was trying to get a spot on the
``Spring Stampede'' card, but he did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rumors of Mick Foley getting in the ring for the WWF anytime
soon is just that ... rumors. Foley may have some time on TV in the
near future, but expect him to be in an official role like a
commissioner of the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sick bay for the WWF is almost full. While ``Stone Cold''
Steve Austin appears on his way back at the ``Backlash''
pay-per-view (but not in the ring), the Undertaker is expected to
remain sidelined with a torn chest muscle until June. The British
Bulldog has no timetable for his return. Grand Master Sexay is
making a speedy recovery from minor knee surgery. Kane should be
back from his broken hand injury this weekend. But the news is not
so good for Billy Gunn. His rotator cuff surgery was completed, but
WWF announcer Jim Ross says Gunn is ``in considerable pain'' and
four to six months away from returning to the ring. The injuries
have caused a problem of a different sort, mainly where do Austin
and Undertaker fit in when they return. The Rock is the top face
and Triple H is the top heel, positions they have taken from Austin
and Undertaker. Many expect Austin to become a heel and turn on The
Rock at ``Backlash,'' but that would form a very odd pairing of
Vince McMahon and Austin, who feuded for nearly two years. WWF fans
may not accept it.
</P>
<P>
   _ One new face for the WWF is a former WCW heel, Scott Vick,
a.k.a. Sickboy. He may form a tag team with Val Venis, although his
gimmick is still in the works. Also Mideon has been spending all of
his time in the gym working to reshape his body (cut the gut and
bulk up his legs). He could work his way to a big role if he makes
it back.
</P>
<P>
   _ WWF might be able to add another WCW star to its roster soon,
Juventud Guererra. His contract is up this year and WWF along with
ECW are expected to make a big push for the underused WCW
high-flier.

 &HT;    Ohio students still fearful in wake of Columbine tragedy
anniversary
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When two troubled young men opened fire on their
classmates and teachers a year ago in Littleton, Colo., they knew
nothing about students Kelly Tipton or Elizabeth Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of miles away and a year after the tragedy at
Columbine High School, Tipton, Gannon and other students in the
Dayton area still are fearful and suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Gannon, a junior at Wayne High School, said a power
outage last fall caused the lights to go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were passing around homecoming pictures, and it suddenly
got dark,'' Gannon said. ``My first thought was that something was
about to happen. I was scared and didn't know what to do so I
followed my first instinct, which was to dive under a table.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Tipton, a senior at Fairborn High School, said before a
year ago she never paid much attention to strangers passing through
the halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one day about two weeks ago I looked out of a classroom
and saw this strange-looking adult in the hallway in a long black
trench coat,'' she said. ``It kind of freaked me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Life has basically returned to normal at local high schools a
year after the Columbine shootings, but the tragedy deeply shook
students at Wayne and Fairborn, and doubtless it shook other
schools in the Dayton area as well.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 11 students interviewed by the Dayton Daily News is
convinced that the shootings that happened at Columbine High School
could just as easily have happened at their school.
</P>
<P>
   All of them have gone back to high school kids' traditional
spring month focus of proms and graduations and senior outings and
spring breaks and who's going out with whom.
</P>
<P>
   But televised images of carnage and panic, and the details of
how Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 classmates and a
teacher before killing themselves is a dark spectre lurking at the
backs of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some schools have even held shooting drills,''
Gannon said. ``We've got fire drills and tornado drills and now we
have to have somebody's-coming-to-shoot-up-your-school drills. You
have to figure out how to do the commando crawl out to the woods to
save your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to say to yourself, 'Wow! How did society get to
this point?'''
</P>
<P>
   PARALLELS EASY TO FIND HERE
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold attacked their fellow
students at Columbine High School in the Denver suburb of
Littleton. Littleton and Columbine have a lot in common with towns
and high schools in the Dayton area. Eric Harris actually lived in
Huber Heights as a toddler and went to elementary school for a
while in Beavercreek.
</P>
<P>
   The correlations were too close for comfort for some local
school districts. Officials at Beavercreek High School, probably
the closest local match to Columbine, declined to be interviewed or
to allow students to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Clements, principal at Fairborn High School, went to
Colorado on vacation last summer and spent some time at Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood on the hill overlooking Columbine in the area where
people had erected memorials,'' Clements said. ``I was struck by
the fact that just the physical appearance of the school is a lot
like my school.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine was a massive school with nearly 2,000 students in a
campus separated into several buildings on a broad campus.
Fairborn, which has about 1,800 students, has a similar layout.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayne campus in Huber Heights also is divided into several
buildings, and the school is one of the largest in Ohio with about
2,300 students, Principal Diane Ivory said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think it's too big,'' Ivory said. ``Most of the
research out there supports the idea that smaller schools are
better for the students. When students feel there are no people who
really know them, there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we just have to do the best we can doing things to make
kids feel like they're in a smaller school since we can't really
break the school up.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NEED TO BE RESPECTED
</P>
<P>
   Like Columbine, Fairborn and Wayne have a mix of ethnic groups
and races within the student body. The student's said that was
another thing that brought the Littleton tragedy home for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they were targeting people was what upset me,''
said Jessie Dysinger, a senior at Fairborn. ``They targeted the
athletes or they targeted the black students or they targeted the
people who looked a certain way. If you look around here, you see
all the same groups they were targeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and principals at both schools said a significant
percentage of their communities are Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
employees, and the base draws a broad racial mix of people who are
used to relocating and fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   Sonal Singhal, a sophomore at Wayne, said learning to get along
with people who seem different is just a part of growing up in
Huber Heights. ``There's always going to be something about you
that is different, and you're always going to run into people who
don't understand you,'' Singhal said. ``You just have to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the motivation for Harris and Klebold seemed to be that
they classified themselves as outsiders. They and other of their
friends separated themselves from the mainstream at Columbine by
dressing in trench coats and calling themselves the Trench Coat
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Though the students and principals said no such drastic cliques
developed at their schools, there are students at Wayne and
Fairborn who don't always fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hunt, a junior at Wayne, said he's more aware now of the
need to treat people with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always see people getting picked on, and it makes you want
to say, 'Hey, you'd better chill on that.' People are always going
to tease and pick on people, but you can't let it go too far,''
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   NO GUARANTEES OF TOTAL SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Clements said Fairborn hired extra guards for the hallways
immediately after the Columbine shootings, mostly to reassure
students and parents that the school was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got calls from parents wanting me to guarantee them their
children would be 100 percent safe here at school,'' Clements said.
``I had to tell them that was impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivory said Wayne always has been proactive about security, and
that Columbine didn't change things much. Students are required to
wear identification cards on lanyards around their necks this year
to get on campus, but that change was in the works before Columbine
and students don't always wear them.
</P>
<P>
   Students and administrators agree that tightened security is not
the answer, however. They say the best way to prevent future
Columbines is through improved parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harris and Klebold planned what they were going to do for a
long time and nobody did anything to stop them,'' said Courtney
Johnson, a junior at Wayne. ``Were their parents in a stupor
somewhere that they didn't know their kids were making bombs in the
garage?''

   KEYLIME-PIE _ FLORIDA CITY, Fla. _ On the edge of the sawgrass
wilderness, where the road to the Everglades National Park takes a
hard left turn, there's an overgrown produce stand with the odd
name ``Robert Is Here'' painted across the roof like a Rock City
barn. Robert is Robert Moehling, the thicket-bearded proprietor,
whose easy smile and roomy midsection suggest that he enjoys his
work. Among the bins of oranges and kumquats, he offers passing
tourists almost anything that can be made with Key limes: honey,
syrup, curd, cookies, fudge, milkshakes, marinade, marmalade, dip,
salsa, salad dressing, mustard, hot sauce, barbecue sauce,
moisturizing cream _ not to mention the people's choice, Key lime
pie. Of all the products under the big shed, the most exotic may be
Key limes themselves. Robert's were actually grown within an hour's
drive of the Keys. You can't say that about many Key limes these
days; almost all of the sour little suckers are imported from
Mexico and the Caribbean. (Aucmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   KEYLIME-PIE _ FLORIDA CITY, Fla. _ On the edge of the sawgrass
wilderness, where the road to the Everglades National Park takes a
hard left turn, there's an overgrown produce stand with the odd
name ``Robert Is Here'' painted across the roof like a Rock City
barn. Robert is Robert Moehling, the thicket-bearded proprietor,
whose easy smile and roomy midsection suggest that he enjoys his
work. Among the bins of oranges and kumquats, he offers passing
tourists almost anything that can be made with Key limes: honey,
syrup, curd, cookies, fudge, milkshakes, marinade, marmalade, dip,
salsa, salad dressing, mustard, hot sauce, barbecue sauce,
moisturizing cream _ not to mention the people's choice, Key lime
pie. Of all the products under the big shed, the most exotic may be
Key limes themselves. Robert's were actually grown within an hour's
drive of the Keys. You can't say that about many Key limes these
days; almost all of the sour little suckers are imported from
Mexico and the Caribbean. (Aucmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

right. You've got country ham.'' A nervous pause. ``So what do I DO
with it,'' Baron asked. I guess country ham is an aquired taste
like the sushi of Baron's homeland. But here in the South, we
celebrate it, especially in the spring, when fall hams have put on
their six months or so of flavor. (Walker, Atlanta

&HT;     ANNE KLEIN IS MAKING A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Anne Klein's youthful design team, Ken Kaufman
and Isaac Franco, have survived a change in ownership and three
years of effort to get the line back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pair were hired, the once quite chic company, which
was always mentioned in the same breath as Ralph Lauren and Donna
Karan, not only lost its star designer, Louis dell'Olio (who was
unceremoniously fired by the previous owners), but its focus too,
as Patrick Robinson and then Richard Tyler managed to alienate the
Anne Klein customer.
</P>
<P>
   Franco and Kaufman have every respect in the world for
dell'Olio's ability to dress the American woman with a kind of
timeless classicism that, in hindsight, looks fresh and new. What
the two have managed to do with the Anne Klein line is to keep that
classicism and make it modern and sexy at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The pair recently brought their spring/summer collection to Saks
Fifth Avenue for a style show celebrating the Susan B. Komen
Foundation's Race for the Cure. The clothes we saw were
representative of the direction the pair are taking the company _
staying within the parentheses of American sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy on suitings _ these done in soft shades of lavender,
wheat, banana, pink and celadon silks, linens and sheer, stretchy
wools _ the line also featured beading, lingerie lace and Indian
sari trims. The latter, featured on a group of charcoal-gray
separates including an ankle-length wrap skirt, virtually ``blew
out the door,'' laughs Franco, 35. ``We have nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   Each collection features a real zotz of color. For spring, a
chili-red the pair call Flame, is worked up in linen and in shiny
Napa leather on a shirtlike jacket with hook-and-eye closures. The
sexiest piece in the show, a one-shoulder siren dress of sequins,
was in this fabulous shade.
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Isaac (they have been working together so long, they
finish each other's thoughts) met shortly after Kaufman, 36, began
working for knitwear firm Waranco, designing knitwear for Geoffrey
Beene and Pringle of Scotland Cashmere. Fresh out of New York's
Fashion Institute of Technology, he hired an assistant _ Franco,
who had just graduated from Parsons School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   The two went together to Bob Mackie for two years and then off
to Italy to work with Valentino and then Anne Klein. Their
collaboration works as if it were on mental ball bearings,
effortlessly, with the two designing not only Anne Klein's five
separate clothings lines (Anne Klein, AK Initials, Anne Klein 2,
A-Line and Anne Klein Suits which will launch in the fall) but also
directing the designs for shoes, swimwear and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What Kaufman and Franco are concerned with, besides creating
well-priced clothes, is to return a ``voice'' to Anne Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our voice is a youthful spirit,'' says Kaufman. ``Our customer
is not a demographic, a size or an occupation. She has a sense of
style and a taste level.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``taste level'' is in line with the original creative
spirit, which came directly from Anne Klein herself. ``When we
first joined the company,'' explains Franco, ``we went back into
the archives to see Anne's original sketches from the late '60s and
early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not about `career sportswear.' It was about
collectible clothes, things which you could carry over for years
instead of looking in your closet and saying, `What was I
thinking?' She wasn't about costumes. Neither are we.''

&HT;     THE TOAST OF NEW YORK BREWPUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTER, N.Y. _ _ For the first time in three years, an
Albany-area brewpub is not the toast of upstate New York
microbreweries.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock Brewing Co., based in Kingston, was awarded the
Matthew Vassar Cup at the third annual Hudson Valley Microbrew &AMP;
Fine Food Festival. In addition to winning the coveted cup,
Woodstock head brewer Nat Collins also won a gold medal for his
Braveheart Scotch Ale.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Pub &AMP; Brewery captured the cup at the inaugural competition
in 1998, while Big House Brewing Co. in Albany won the award last
year. The prizes were awarded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This year's competition held here at a ski resort was markedly
different from the first two, which were held at the Culinary
Institute of America in Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one breweries, each bringing three beers that were
savored and rated by a panel of certified beer judges, entered.
Thirteen breweries took part in 1998; 14 last year.
</P>
<P>
   High Point Wheat Beer Co., from High Point, N.J., was the only
non-New York state brewery at the event. High Point brewer Greg
Zaccardi claimed runner-up honors with Ramstein Blonde, a
traditional hefeweizen. High Point is the first exclusive wheat
beer brewery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze medal went to Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown for its
Rare Vos. Ommegang is the only brewery in the country that produces
only Belgian-style beers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Woodring, founder of the Hudson Valley Home Brewers Club,
one of the largest such groups in the nation, organized the
festival. Matthew Vassar, for whom the best brewery cup is named,
founded Vassar College more than a century ago with capital he
acquired in the brewing industry.
</P>
<P>
   This year's gold-medal beer, the Braveheart Scotch Ale, was
awarded a bronze medal at the first competition. It has a deep
copper color and a relatively high alcohol content, approximately 9
percent. In the tradition of Scotch-style ales, Braveheart is
sweetly malty and full-bodied. It is also exceptionally clean.

&HT;     SYBASE REBOUNDS FROM TOUGH TIMES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two years after laying off 1,000 workers and
restructuring its core business, Sybase Inc. is reaping the
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the first quarter of 2000, excluding accounting
adjustments for last year's purchase of Home Financial Network
Inc., rose to $19.5 million (22 cents a share) from $8.5 million
(10 cents) a year ago. That beat per-share expectations of 13
cents, the average estimate of four analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Including the accounting adjustments, earnings rose to $6.7
million (8 cents) from $5.9 million (7 cents). Revenue rose 9.1
percent to $227 million from $208 million.
</P>
<P>
   To top things off, the company reported cash reserves of $363
million.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company many had left for dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reengineering this company for over two years,''
said John Chen, chairman, president and CEO of Sybase. ``It hasn't
been easy. What with the whole dot-com environment growing around
us, keeping our core team upbeat and intact hasn't been a walk in
the park. It's been more like a walk through Central Park . . .
after dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen has reason for optimism these days, having captained one of
the most dramatic turnarounds in recent software history.
</P>
<P>
   Once a database powerhouse, Emeryville, Calif.-based Sybase fell
on some hard times in the mid-1990s. An ill-fated licensing
agreement with Microsoft, a poorly received software upgrade and
continual pressure from Oracle Corp. led to a string of annual
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing came to a head in 1998 when then-CEO Mitchell
Kertzman left after a short tenure to take a job with a division of
arch-rival Oracle. It seemed that Sybase had seen its finest days.
</P>
<P>
   Enter John Chen, a respected former executive for Siemens
Nixdorf AG, in Munich, where he served as president and CEO of
Siemens Nixdorf's $3 billion Open Enterprise Computing Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began to study our history and sales model, I realized
the space we were in was saturated and our customers were looking
for a new level of services,`` said Chen in an interview with The
Examiner. ``At that time, I realized we were not category winners,
but we had a strong in-store base.''
</P>
<P>
   So he rolled up the sleeves and started to clean house. First to
go were about 1,000 workers. Next came a reorganization of
operations into embedded applications and other technology-based
divisions that took their core business beyond database software.
It was a classic diversification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized we had to really change,'' said Chen, ``which
included identifying a high-growth market and cleaning up the
balance sheets. Unfortunately, all those things all happened at the
same time. We didn't have the luxury of taking things sequentially.
But it's all been rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   In financial terms, the rewards have become sizable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest-ever operating-income first quarter in the
history of the company, going back 15 years ago,'' said Chen, whose
company now boasts 4,214 workers worldwide. ``I would also venture
to say this is the highest cash balance we've ever had. And this is
also the first quarter in a very long time that we have appreciated
revenue growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said the company plans to use its cash reserves for
acquisitions and expansions, continuing to grow its business plan
beyond the world of databases.
</P>
<P>
   Sybase agreed last December to acquire closely held Home
Financial Network, of Reston, Va., for $130 million and combine it
into a new company to target the online financial-services market.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Chen's plan to make consulting, technical
support and other services represent more than half of the
company's sales, shielding it from the fickle swings of the
software business.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting large corporate customers, the company has had a good
amount of success in Asian markets over the past two years, where
corporate restructuring following the region's financial crisis has
fueled a need for databases and services.
</P>
<P>
   Internet banking, as well as the wireless database market, will
be two focal points for the company as it moves forward, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Sybase shares closed up $3.31 at $21.88 before the company
announced earnings. In after-hours trading, the stock gained
another $2.13 to hit $24. The company's shares have now more than
tripled since hitting a 52-week low of $7.13 in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing pretty good,'' said Chen, who was happy to see
some sanity return to the markets in recent days. ``I think the
market correction was a good thing. It reminds people that cash is
king and real revenue rules. Let's go back to being a market ruled
by the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Sybase said that it settled two lawsuits brought
against the company, its officers and directors over the company's
restatement of its 1997 financial results. Both settlements are
subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sybase didn't disclose the terms of the settlements. The
settlements won't hurt the company financially, Sybase said.

&HT;     HIGH SCHOOL GEEKS TALK ABOUT STOCK OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At first glance, Aaron Stone's resume reads like
a blueprint for Silicon Valley success.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years as a freelance consultant. A partnership with
friends. A dot-com start-up. It's all there.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a major obstacle looms on the horizon: high school
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Stone, and his partner, Phil Polanski, are 18
years old, and they go to Palo Alto High School, right smack in the
heart of Silicon Valley. They're also the co-founders of
Impressitron.com, a Web site consultancy that is ``a solution for
start-ups that are having trouble getting their Web sites up and
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the duo's story is a common one at the school
affectionately known as Paly High, where stock options and
start-ups are as common as readin' and 'rithmetic. Stone, among
others, is featured in the documentary ``Paly High: Between
Classes.'' While much of the teenage, cliquey angst is instantly
recognizable to anyone who did time at an American high school, the
business savvy of the student body is pure valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely more aware of money and making money than
when I was in school,`` said Jona Frank, the San Francisco
filmmaker who produced ``Paly High'' for KQED's ``Bay Window''
series. ``It's very much a game to them, about playing with the
Internet and the stock market. It's fun to them. It's just the way
they amuse themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Stone's estimates, there are probably a couple of
hundred students at the school who intern or work at tech-related
companies in Silicon Valley. On top of that, a number of other
students have started companies of their own at Paly High, all
hoping to catch the tech wave of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Pang, a 17-year-old senior, got his feet wet in the Web
world working summers at Alteon Websystems in San Jose. Like many
of his valley colleagues, stock options were part of his pay
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really lucky to work for a company that believed in
distributing the wealth among everyone, not just the top brass,''
said Pang, sounding twice his age.
</P>
<P>
   While Frank's documentary touches on the business exploits of
Paly High's students, it delves deeper into the social interactions
among the school's various social groups. Shooting in black and
white, Frank lets the students narrate their own realities,
discussing the cliques, music and clothes they and their peers use
to define themselves at the 1,400-student school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is about what happens in between the structured time
of school,'' said Frank. ``Different students pointed out to me
that a skater might be partnered with a jock in science class, but
they would not eat lunch together. Lunch time, after-school time,
social time is when people form their own cliques. This is the time
that most interests me because it is the in-between time that
reflects people's personalities and their search for identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Paly High's tech set spends its in-between time in the
``robotics team'' lab. Sequestered on one side of the campus, the
self-proclaimed geeks work together to build a 130-pound robot
that's entered in a nationwide competition held in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Stone and Polanski met. And that's where the
techies spend most of their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the time of the competition, a six-week period
beginning in January, I would say we spend upwards of 50 hours a
week here,'' said Stone. ``There are times when we'll spend entire
days or more here.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time together, a number of the robotics team members
realized they were all doing Web work on the side. That's when the
entrepreneurial bug took a bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just noticed that, as a group, we were more effective at
selling our talents,'' said Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski credits the high school with much of his technology
talent, comparing it unfavorably with his former school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did go to San Mateo High School my freshman year,'' said
Polanski, who will join Stone at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo this
fall. ``Technology there was really behind. They only had six
computers that were really slow and were crashing all the time.
Then I came here, and we have 25 Pentium III 500 (MHz) machines
hooked up to the district's T1 line.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank sees the proximity to Silicon Valley as the primary reason
some students are so involved with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so present in their lives. Most of their parents are
involved in technology,`` said Frank. ``I think if there's a
downside, it's just about having to think about money while being
young.''
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, it's not so bad being a techie anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status of what it means to be a geek has changed,'' said
Frank. ``Their
</P>
<P>
   self-confidence is better and there's more of them. They feel
more supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still looked upon as the techy, nerdy types. But
because of the success of people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs,
they're also looked upon as people whose skill will pay off for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pang, who will attend UC-Irvine in the fall, says he's missed
out on the partying but isn't too worried about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have missed out on a lot of social events to pursue my
career,'' he said, pointing out that he'd try to make up for lost
time on a trip to Europe this summer. ``During all my vacation
times, I spent them at the company instead of getting drunk down in
Santa Cruz or something. ``But as they say on `Buffy': `Geeks are
in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who runs a San Francisco production company called Camp
Pokomoke, has built a career around the social environments of
young people. For the past two years, she has been working on a
photo book on adolescent social groups, called ``High School.''
She's also shot and produced a short film called ``Catholic
School,'' which won acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival in 1999.

&HT;     PAC-10 PROBES CAL FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ A Pac-10 investigation into allegations of
academic fraud against two former Cal football players was
apparently prompted by complaints from their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year wide receivers Michael Ainsworth and Ronnie
Davenport are the subject of the probe to determine whether they
received credit for a class they only attended the last few weeks
of the 1999 spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has confirmed that an investigation is under way,
without divulging any findings.
</P>
<P>
   Football coach Tom Holmoe said a thorough in-house investigation
last spring failed to find any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ainsworth and Davenport have since flunked out of Cal and are
enrolled in junior colleges in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Holmoe said the in-house probe followed ``rumors'' from older
players on the team regarding Ainsworth's and Davenport's academic
performance. He acknowledged that some players resented the lack of
work ethic shown by the two wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Pac-10 investigation _ as well as the in-house
Cal probe _ involved allegations that both players got credit for
an ethnic studies course called ``Crossroads: California and the
World'' even though they didn't actually enroll in the course until
two weeks before the end of the semester.
</P>
<P>
   The course's teacher, Alex Saragoza, has told university
officials that the two were in the class even though they may not
have officially signed on until late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Cal officials say it's fairly common for students to add courses
late in the semester, for reasons including paperwork foul-ups or
waiting list problems for popular classes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lester, Cal's faculty athletics representative and a
professor of chemistry, said the school's investigation found
nothing out of the ordinary in the Ainsworth-Davenport case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what was done was the appropriate addition of
classes,'' he said. ``These guys followed protocol. They had been
in the class. They just added it. They were not registered for
whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester said that professors often ``frowned'' on the late adds,
but said they were acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Holmoe cited the example of another player who recently was
notified he was getting an F in a class. In this case, the player
had inadvertently enrolled in the wrong class and has been
attending another class even though he wasn't officially enrolled.
Now, with just a few weeks left in the semester, he is adding the
class he's actually been attending and dropping the course he never
intended to enroll in.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Muldoon, Pac-10 spokesman, would only confirm that the
investigation was under way. He did note that such probes were
fairly common, with the conference following up on academic
compliance issues on a ``constant basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The case offers a rare glimpse into the chemistry on last year's
Cal football team and dissension prompted by the two wide
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ainsworth and Davenport were often the subject of disciplinary
actions, doing extra running drills for a variety of infractions.
Ainsworth was suspended for one game for violating a team rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys resented the way they acted,'' Holmoe said.
``There were some tremendous kids on the team last year that had
sacrificed a lot. . . .Academically and athletically, the players
ask a lot of each other and when players don't join in, that makes
it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal's investigation was conducted by Gloria Nevarez, the
athletic department's director of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   If the conference discovers any improprieties, the case could be
forwarded to the NCAA, where possible penalties could include
forfeiting games from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Associate athletic director Bob Driscoll said the school was
expecting the Pac-10 to clear the school of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've talked to a number of people and have come to
the same conclusions we did,'' he said. ``There's nothing there. If
they had something they certainly would have brought it forth.
We're pretty confident about this one.''

   There must be a place in the Bible where Jesus or one of the
Hebrew prophets inveighs against reveling in other people's
misfortunes; the precise passage does not come to mind. And yet how
can one not indulge a certain pleasure in the wipeout of the
dot-com stocks during the past few weeks?
</P>
<P>
   The odious stock jockey James Cramer, co-founder of
TheStreet.com, has canceled vacation this week to watch his equity
positions erode. Just a few months ago, Jim wanted me to pay $100 a
year to visit his Web site and read his dribblings on the market.
Now, I can read them for free.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com's hot stock, which made paper millionaires of
those journalists clever enough to leave the dying
newsprint-and-ink business I work in, is now ``under water,''
meaning it is worth less that its initial offering price. It was
initially offered at $19; now it is worth $6. Paper millionaires no
more.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Schadenfreude Crash. Do you know the term? ``The
malicious enjoyment of the misfortunes of others,'' according to
the dictionary. It is not a pretty emotion _ we don't live in a
world of exclusively pretty emotions _ but it is a real one.
</P>
<P>
   How could you not feel battered by those ubiquitous, guileless
newsmagazine cover stories, A) cursing you for not being a
Web-savvy 23-year-old billionaire, B) damning you for not investing
our life savings in the latest lookalike-idea.com (this assumes you
are too stupid to notice that Peapod, WebVan, Streamline, and
HomeRuns are all in the same business), and C) assuring you that if
you, like, assemble cars for a living, you're a sap. In the future,
no one will drive a car! We'll all be traveling on Mr. Gore's
information highway!
</P>
<P>
   So let the ``tarantulas of resentment'' _ Nietzche's phrase,
effectively recycled by Tom Wolfe in his recent novel, ``A Man in
Full'' _ scutter forth! Where's my friend, the former surgeon
general C. Everett Koop? Glub, glub . . . he's under water, too!
From a high of $45, Drkoop.com is now trading at $2. The good
doctor and his henchperson, TV doc Nancy Snyderman, have been
bailing out on the way down: he's sold about $1 million worth,
she's dumped $2.6 million worth since the beginning of the year.
Would you were so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Joke stock of the year Healtheon MD has lost 84 percent of its
value. IVillage is off 88 percent. Stamps.com _ they never sent me
my free stamps! _ off 89 percent. Since its recent public offering,
Martha Stewart's multimedia empire has lost about $1.5 billion in
value. It is all too sad to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   What did I do in the new economy, you ask? I bought two stocks:
New York Times, at a substantial discount because they own the
Globe, and Phillip Morris, partly as a classic value play _ the
company's non-cigarette holdings are supposedly worth more than $18
a share, where I came in _ and partly for ideological reasons. The
feckless greed of the politicians and plaintiffs' lawyers preying
on Big Tobacco turns my stomach. Fine, the tobacco execs are no
choirboys _ what of it? I smoked; I screwed up my health. Whose
fault is that?
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. I'm up 16 percent in Phillip Morris, so I've
outperformed both the Dow and Fidelity's Magellan Fund in recent
months. The classic newspaper stocks like Times Mirror, Knight
Ridder, and New York Times _ despite its ill-advised investment in
Thestreet.com _ have held up pretty well. Alas, the same cannot be
said for our esteemed Web competitors, who predict the demise of
boring old newspapers several times a day. Did someone mention
Salon.com? If present trends continue, that stock will soon have
the approximate worth of Confederate currency, circa 1866.
</P>
<P>
   I recognized the market top about four months ago, when I
received an unsolicited job offer to join a dot-com. Just as J.P.
Morgan started to sell when he heard his shoeshine boy talking
about the stock market, I knew we had reached a turning point. The
dotcoms were so desperate, they wanted me! I advised a few friends
to start trimming their positions, but I doubt they listened. After
all, what do I know?

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Liz Murray is standing on the stage of the auditorium
of PS 95 in the Bronx, telling 400 fifth- and sixth-graders about
her life. Several of the children are holding pieces of paper,
ready to snare her autograph. One girl has a strategic plan (which
she will later successfully execute) to pull out a strand of
Murray's hair.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old in faded jeans, worn sneakers, and flannel shirt
_ though statuesque and poised _ isn't the typical adolescent pop
icon, which one might expect given the audience adoration. She's
not a basketball star or a rock singer or an actress (though Minnie
Driver would be perfectly cast in the movie that will inevitably be
made about Murray one day.)
</P>
<P>
   The truth is far more spectacular. The daughter of two cocaine
addicts, Murray dropped out of school in the ninth grade, lived on
the streets of New York from the age of 16 until 18, slept on
subway trains and park benches, and finally, through sheer force of
will, reversed her fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Murray is headed to Harvard, accepted as a freshman
the year the university reported a record number of applications.
``It's surreal,'' says Barbara Franceschini, who was Murray's
teacher in the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The story gets even more surreal. As word has gotten out about
her accomplishments (she won a prestigious New York Times College
Scholarship last year, which led to a segment about her in December
on ABC's ``20/20''), Hollywood honchos, always ready to glorify
despair, have taken her under their wing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, she's been a guest on ``The Montel
Williams Show,'' Candice Bergen's ``Exhale'' talk show on the
Oxygen network, and ``Leeza'' with Leeza Gibbons. Thursday, NBC's
``Later Today'' show will air a live segment about her on a show
celebrating extraordinary young people.
</P>
<P>
   Through her connections with the celebrity she now calls
``Candice,'' she has met actress Sigourney Weaver and playwrights
Wendy Wasserstein and John Guare; Guare took her last week to see
the Broadway production of ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the girl who picked food out of trash cans and did her
homework in stairwells is checking her voice mail on her cell phone
and asking a reporter if she can ``expense'' the taxi she's
flagging down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely wild,'' says Murray of the arc _ from homeless
to Harvard to Hollywood _ that her life has made. ``For a long time
I was just stuck in one place, saying, `You were there, and now you
are here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But ask Franceschini and Helene Lorinsky _ two teachers in the
audience who taught her in elementary school _ and they'll say
nothing would surprise them about the girl they used to call
Elizabeth. ``She was very special,'' Franceschini recalls.
</P>
<P>
   They taught her at PS 261 in the Bronx, a windowless school so
decrepit it was declared a health hazard and closed the year Murray
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Her teachers describe her as a tough and stoic child who was
placed in the intellectually gifted class, talented at math, and so
driven to work hard she chose to play Brutus in the class
production of ``Julius Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in her classroom, Franceschini pulls out a stuffed toy
penguin from under a desk and explains it is a cherished gift from
Murray the year she graduated elementary school. Murray gave it to
her because Franceschini had read the book ``Mr. Popper's
Penguins'' to the class, and because her maiden name was Popper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had told her how much I loved penguins,'' Franceschini said,
``and Elizabeth wrote letters and made phone calls to zoos to find
where she could get me one. When she couldn't, she gave me this. I
don't know where the girl who had no money found the money for it.
It was so touching.''
</P>
<P>
   There were hints, big hints, that something was wrong at home.
Murray's mother once showed up at school in a nightgown, with feces
on her shoes. During one period, Elizabeth wore the same pair of
pants to school every day for months. But her teachers didn't have
the whole story. They knew her mother had been in and out of
hospitals, but not that she was an alcoholic, or that her parents
did cocaine in the kitchen, without trying to hide their habit. Nor
did they know that the apartment where she lived with her parents
and sister was filthy, not helped by the presence of two cats and a
dog which no one walked or cared for. (Murray would have to step
over piles of feces covered with maggots to get to her bedroom.)
</P>
<P>
   On good days, Elizabeth's mother read her Dr. Seuss stories and
listened to old records; her father _ he is ``extremely
intelligent'' _ would quote from 1940s novels but ``then go into
the kitchen and shoot up drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither parent was a provider. At the age of ``8 or 9,''
Murray recalls, she worked bagging groceries at a 24-hour
supermarket. ``I was the only one putting food in the fridge,'' she
tells the hushed schoolchildren in the PS 95 auditorium. She also
pumped gas for tips at self-service gas stations. Money was so
tight her mother once sold her sister's winter coat to get some
cash.
</P>
<P>
   After her parents separated when she was 13, her father ran out
of money and lost the apartment. Murray went into a city youth
facility for a few months but couldn't bear to stay there: ``It was
dehumanizing, and I'm too full of spirit.'' She went to live with
her mother and godfather. ``They were old drinking buddies,''
Murray explains. But that didn't last long, since her mother was
diagnosed with AIDS and tuberculosis; she died in December 1996.
(Her sister, Lisa, stayed on at the godfather's till finding her
own apartment last year.)
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth grade, Murray dropped out of school. To pass the
time and lift her spirits, she often went to libraries to read
``Hamlet'' and Shakespeare's sonnets. She quotes by memory a
favorite poem by Edgar Allan Poe, called ``Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From childhood's hour I have not been
</P>
<P>
   As others were; I have not seen
</P>
<P>
   As others saw; I could not bring
</P>
<P>
   My passions from a common spring.
</P>
<P>
   From the same source I have not taken
</P>
<P>
   My sorrow; I could not awaken
</P>
<P>
   My heart to joy at the same tone;
</P>
<P>
   And all I loved, I loved alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 16, Murray hit the streets. Sometimes, she'd sleep
at friends' houses, ``until I'd hear their parents talking in low
voices and I knew I was wearing out my welcome,'' she says later
that day in an interview. Other times, she slept on park benches or
subways, panhandling for spare change to get on the trains.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to return to high school came at the lowest point
of her life _ the day she saw her mother's coffin at the cemetery,
a donated pine box with her name misspelled in Magic Marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality really hit me,'' she tells the children. ``Everything
I knew about had messed up. And I understood it was important to
push myself, that I'd either make it good for myself . . . or
submit to everything that was happening and live a life of
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   One teacher she contacted recommended the Humanities Preparatory
Academy, a small progressive school in Manhattan known for working
with students who are lost in the conventional school system.
Despite the fact that her transcript was ``one big blank,'' says
Perry Weiner, the school's co-director, her intelligence impressed
officials, and she was accepted.

VIOLENT CRIMINAL CASES TAKE THEIR TOLL ON JURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sixteen months after his jury service ended, Edward
Wack still carries an unwanted memento of the month he spent in
Middlesex Superior Court: a detailed, indelible memory of the
medical examiner's photos of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley's
suffocated, decomposing corpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember them pretty clearly,'' the 33-year-old
engineer says
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley can understand that
sort of post-trial trauma. She was stunned recently to learn of a
former classmate's nervous breakdown after serving as a juror on a
gruesome murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often ignore the fact that the jurors we are picking are
ordinary bankers and teachers who, within an hour, may be hearing
about a brutal murder or the rape of a child,'' Coakley said. ``I
think we do not pay enough attention to the stress that it subjects
them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley is one of a number of law enforcement officials, judges,
and court administrators who believe that jurors asked to make
decisions in violent court cases should be offered at least some
form of post-trial counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the government, are asking jurors to subject themselves to
(troubling testimony). This is something we can do in return,''
Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference of Massachusetts judges last Friday, many agreed
that, at a minimum, judges should meet privately with jurors after
they have returned their verdict to give them an opportunity to
discuss their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic evidence and testimony in cases such as the one
involving Curley, a Cambridge boy murdered while trying to resist
two men who were attempting to sexually assault him, isn't the only
potential problem for jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The very measures designed to ensure a fair trial for defendants
_ sequestering jurors, prohibiting them from talking about the case
during the trial _ can add to the mental and emotional pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spent the whole day listening to this gruesome testimony.
It bottles up inside you and you want to talk about it, but you
can't,'' said Wack, who was on the panel that convicted 22-year-old
Salvatore Sicari of Curley's Oct. 1, 1997, murder.
</P>
<P>
   Wack is not alone. A 1998 survey by the Virginia-based National
Center for State Courts indicates that nearly half of jurors on
cases lasting 11 days or more reported ``disturbing memories,''
while nearly a third said they felt ``numb and detached'' after the
case was over.
</P>
<P>
   And the longer the case, the more of a toll on jurors. In cases
lasting 20 days or more, 96 percent of jurors experienced stress,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   More than 26 percent of the jurors surveyed said that
``something should have been done'' to make their experience less
emotionally taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well documented in a clinical research sense that jury
service can be very stressful. After a criminal trial, jurors have
been observed having problems sleeping and coping with stress,''
said Robert Brink, director of the Flaschner Judicial Institute in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The institute cosponsored the conference in Randolph at which
more than 200 Massachusetts judges learned the results of a
two-year study aimed at making trials more juror-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation, according to Superior Court Judge Peter M.
Lauriat, was that, at a minimum, judges should speak with jurors
after stressful cases and warn them about what might lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have judges meet with them and tell them about some
of the feelings they are likely to experience: the nightmares,
flashbacks, self-doubts,'' Lauriat said. ``If it becomes extreme,
they should be encouraged to seek professional assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are no official court resources for post-trial
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need there, and we need to address it,'' Lauriat
said. Though resources are scarce, he said, it might be possible to
expand the state court clinic _ which offers counseling to new
defendants _ to include jurors who believe they need help.
</P>
<P>
   State Jury Commissioner Frank Davis said there have been
discussions about putting a psychologist on the court payroll or
hiring one on a freelance basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said he does not see juror stress as a major problem.
Those who might be emotionally fragile, he said, are screened out
during jury selection. The vast majority, he said, get through the
experience without any long-term emotional damage.
</P>
<P>
   The judges who attended the conference also agreed to study
further whether jurors should be allowed to talk about ongoing
cases. It's an issue that sharply divides the legal community, with
some fearing that jurors will become wedded to positions before
they've heard all the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions that emerged from the two-year study included
allowing jurors to take notes, a practice allowed by some judges;
giving jury instructions in ``plain English;'' and permitting
jurors to ask witnesses questions, a practice that some federal
court judges follow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just before sundown Tuesday, as his father and his
grandfather had done before him, Rabbi Naftali Horowitz led a small
group of Jews into the Blue Hills to draw fresh water for making
matzo.
</P>
<P>
   They will gather in the basement of Brookline's Beth Pinchas
synagogue, mixing that water by hand with special flour from New
York, kneading and perforating the dough, and baking it for not
longer than 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time-honored method of making unleavened bread for
Passover, a practice guided for millennia by tradition and Jewish
law.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike their ancestors, the vast majority of Jews in
America and throughout the world will not eat fresh, hand-made,
rough, round matzo when they gather for the first seder, the ritual
dinner that begins the eight-day Passover holiday commemorating the
Jewish exodus from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will eat matzo that is machine-made and square,
with every piece looking and tasting the same and the package
featuring a well-known brand name such as Manischewitz.
</P>
<P>
   Now, research by a Brandeis University scholar reveals that the
dramatic transformation of matzo from a locally hand-crafted ritual
product into an international food commodity was the result of a
collision between the modernizing forces of industrialization in
America and the change-resistant strictures of the ancient Jewish
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it was round, and now it's square. Once it was varied,
and now every matzo is the same. It was a quintessentially local
product, and now it's become a brand,'' said Jonathan D. Sarna, a
historian of American Judaism who has been researching the
Americanization of matzo. ``How on earth did they persuade Jews to
buy this stuff, and how did they get the rabbis to say it's OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers, Sarna said, are classically American, as matzo
manufacturing was affected by the same economic forces that
reshaped the manufacture of many consumer products at the turn of
the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Behr Manischewitz, the founder of the well-known Passover
products company, created a new market by patenting machines that
could make matzo more economically and for wide distribution, and
he successfully turned change to his advantage, promoting a product
that had always been hand-made with the slogan ``no human hand
touches these matzos.''
</P>
<P>
   But the answers are also peculiarly Jewish, because the
modernization of matzo was almost blocked by the religious
authorities governing a tradition resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern European rabbinic authorities in the late 19th century
were adamant that machine-made matzo is unacceptable _ a position
some Orthodox rabbis still hold today _ and Manischewitz was forced
to spend years and dollars courting a new group of religious
authorities in what was then Palestine before winning the
rabbinical stamp of approval necessary before Jews would purchase
his matzo.
</P>
<P>
   The debate continues today. Despite the fact that hand-made
matzo can cost up to $25 a pound, compared with less than $2 per
pound for machine-made matzo, the Butcherie, a kosher grocery in
Brookline, has seen increasing sales of hand-made matzo in recent
years, and sold out this year's supply days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are commanded to eat matzo during Passover to honor their
ancestors who fled Egypt in such haste that they did not have time
to allow their bread to rise.
</P>
<P>
   In colonial America, matzo was generally baked in ovens in the
basement of synagogues, as Congregation Beth Pinchas does today.
But by 1886, when Behr Manischewitz emigrated from Prussia to
Cincinnati, most matzo in the United States was being made in local
Jewish bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1888 Manischewitz, who had been a ritual slaughterer in
Prussia, opened his own matzo factory, taking advantage of his
experience negotiating the complex regulations governing Jewish
ritual foods.
</P>
<P>
   Manischewitz and his son won more than 50 patents, including one
for a conveyor belt system that ensured that matzo did not bake for
longer than the 18-minute limit spelled out in Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to all of these innovations, Manischewitz could produce
more matzo, more cheaply, with less breakage, and with a much more
regular and pleasing appearance than had ever before been
possible,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   But Manischewitz ran into a problem _ the opposition of European
rabbis who raised religious and economic objections.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis said matzo, according to Jewish tradition, must be
made with human intent, which machines can't have. And, they
argued, machines would displace an important source of seasonal
employment for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Needing rabbinic approval and unable to get it in Europe,
Manischewitz aggressively courted the emerging rabbinate in
Palestine. He sent two of his sons to study there, and both married
into prominent Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the Manischewitz family established a yeshiva,
a school for training rabbis, and gave annual donations of money
and matzo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the Internal Revenue Service took the Manischewitz
company to court over its practice of deducting as a business
expense contributions to the yeshiva, and it is here, Sarna said,
that the interplay between business, philanthropy, and faith
becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   In tax court documents, Manischewitz argued that its
contributions would help ``overcome the impression . . . that
American machine-made matzos are not kosher.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax court sided with the company, ruling that, ``although
there can be little doubt that the contributions to the seminary
were prompted by a complex of motives . . . (there were) reasonably
evident business purposes to be served.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most obvious evidence that industrialization alone
would not have forced the transformation of matzo is the fate of
challah, the bread that Jews eat each sabbath, which is locally
made and varies in form and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is not used to the kind of uniformity that we see with
matzo,'' said Rabbi William Hamilton of Congregation Kehillath
Israel in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process with matzo represents the confrontation
between Judaism and modernity,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Manischewitz is now part of a large private food distributor,
RAB Holdings, and the company sells a variety of Jewish products,
including matzo that is salted or unsalted, whole wheat or plain,
egg, and, of course, yolk-free egg. The matzo, some of which is not
kosher for Passover, now comes in big squares, thin tea sheets, and
bite-sized crackers.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the variety of machine-made matzo from savory garlic
to apple cinammon lining today's supermarket shelves, the debate
that almost prevented Manischewitz's success continues today among
the most observant Jews. A small but growing segment of Jews is
purchasing expensive and hard-to-find shmurah matzo, which is
prepared with purpose and is supervised from the time the wheat is
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Ruboy, one of the Butcherie's owners, said consumers
offer a variety of reasons for buying the old-fashioned matzo,
including, ironically, yet another trend in American consumerism,
the preference for premium products.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some families it's traditional, for others it's
fashionable, and for other people it's a very religious thing to
have,'' he said.

A TALL TALE ON A MAINE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEALS ISLAND, Maine _ Tricia Carver, a 6-foot-tall girls
basketball phenomenon, is more than familiar with the Tall Barney
theory.
</P>
<P>
   A broadshouldered blonde with swimming-pool blue eyes, the
Jonesport-Beals High School senior has a reach that made coaches
from competing high schools throw up their hands in despair.
</P>
<P>
   As the Royalettes advanced toward the state championships this
spring, the island celebrated Carver, the third of three
extraordinarily talented sisters. And a few older relatives _ the
ones steeped in five generations of Beals Island folklore _
silently thanked Carver's nearly 7-foot-tall forebear: Tall Barney
Beal, a legendary 19th-century strongman. Carver has a tolerant
affection for the stories of her great-great-great-grandfather, who
was so strong, according to local lore, that he once killed a horse
by punching it in the head. But she's leery of attributing the
town's athletic record to anything as far-fetched as a giant's gene
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun legend to have. You don't want to dispute it,''
said Carver, 18, from a house still decorated after the
championship win. ``As far as supporting the theory, I don't know
what you could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Beals Island, where 10 generations of Beals have made
their living on the sea from the time they were children, it
doesn't take long to find stories of abnormal physical strength _
tales of iron spikes being bent, rocks being lifted for sport, and
motor transmissions being tucked under the arms.
</P>
<P>
   And that mystique of physical prowess has survived in the arena
of high school basketball. Players from Beals, population 700, have
been amazing mainland observers with their strength and toughness
for years, and Jonesport-Beals High School, with its 120 students,
has won nine state championships in boys basketball and three state
championships in girls basketball. Since the early '90s, four women
from Jonesport-Beals have gone on to play Division 1 athletics in
college, an astonishing number for a school of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems incredible that they produce these athletes year
after year after year. You'd think every now and then they'd take a
year off,'' said Rick Amero, who coaches the Monmouth High School's
girls basketball team, and has faced the Royalettes in tournaments.
Said John Holyoke, who has covered the high school basketball
tournament for the Bangor Daily News: ``What they always said is
that they come down to Bangor, and they bring a bunch of men to
play against boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is still a community that values the kind of
physical strength that is not found in downtown gyms. While
shrugging off the idea that she is a Tall Barney throwback, Carver
brings up the phenomenon of her neighbor, Mitchell Beal, who is
said to have once kicked an 80-pound punching bag so hard that its
chain broke and it flew across the room. Beal, who stands 6-foot-5,
says he is ``nothing like as strong as they say (Tall Barney)
was,'' but tipped his hat to another neighbor, Findy Alley, who was
known during his lifetime for folding 50-cent pieces in half using
two fingers. It isn't unusual on this island, Beal added, for men
to have a ring size of 12 or 14. (``Enormous,'' said a Boston
jeweler, whose typical male client wears a size 9 or 10.)
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with Tall Barney, who was born to an island boatbuilder
in 1836 and grew to such proportions that women hid their best
chairs when they saw him coming, lest he destroy them by sitting
down. Estimates of his height range from 6-foot-7 to over 7 feet;
he slept with his feet sticking out of the window, the story goes,
and when he sat on a chair, his fingertips brushed the floor. For
the most part, Tall Barney folklore centers on heavy things he
lifted. There was the time he lifted a dory, or fishing boat, full
to the rim with clams; there was the time he pushed a wheelbarrow
loaded with a cord of wood. As the story goes, he hoisted two full
barrels of flour under his arms and sauntered down the street. When
he drank, especially in the company of his friend ``Short Barney''
Beal, Tall Barney grew more antic. He is famous for killing a horse
barehanded _ because the horse's owner had angered him, or, in
another rendering, because on a drinking binge in Portland he had
declared that he was going to hit the next thing he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years after the last islanders who knew Tall Barney
died, the only written compilations of the genealogy and folklore
are the work of Velton Peabody, a descendant of Tall Barney's who
left the island in 1965 to become a newspaperman and returned last
year with his accent nearly gone. In his efforts to spread the word
about Tall Barney, Peabody has pointed out that seven of the 13
girls on Jonesport-Beals's championship team this year could trace
their ancestry to Tall Barney. Marcia Beal Brazer, an Ogunquit
filmmaker, is working on a documentary about Tall Barney's
contribution to the school's athletic record.
</P>
<P>
   Avery Kelley's theory is that islanders are so familiar with
their own peculiar qualities that they don't even notice them.
``People here never did realize they was two-three times stronger
than the ordinary man, and it's a hard job to make them believe
it,'' said Kelley, 59, a great-great-grandson of Tall Barney's. He
offers Mitchell Beal as an example. ``He's a monstrous big guy, and
he thinks everybody's as strong as he is and as tall as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legends hold less sway for most of the island's
long-term residents, said Colleen Haskell, the high school
principal, who arrives at school many mornings to find 10 boys
playing basketball outside. The more common account here _ where
most houses are flanked by a pile of lobster traps and a basketball
hoop _ has to do with the work ethic of a seafaring community.
Coaches from other schools have long speculated that island players
practiced in hip boots until the season started, so when they
switched to sneakers they could jump higher. Others credit boredom.
Glenn Libby, the girls basketball coach, said when he was a
teenager he and his friends would play ``for two or three hours,
twice a day,'' shoveling snow off the courts in the winter and
playing with gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you do in the winter in Maine,'' said Haskell. ``And
the winters in Maine are long.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that, as the seafaring life changes, the Tall Barney
legend has outlived its usefulness. Edward Ives, who taught
folklore at the University of Maine for 44 years, said that many
towns up and down the coast have spun stories about local
``strongmen,'' but that the legends could lose their relevance in a
culture where ``we don't need to be that strong anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Carver, Tricia's father, turned away college basketball
recruiters because all he wanted to do was go to sea. But he, like
many of the island's fishermen, worries that government catch
limits will make fishing into a business that doesn't reward
strength. Already, he said, the boys are more likely to turn on
their computers than compete to see who can lift the biggest rock,
as his friends did when he was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, in those days, strength was one of those things they
measured each other by,'' said Carver, 46. ``Now those things are
done hydraulically.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mitchell Beal, 38, wonders whether his young son _
a copperheaded boy in pajamas _ will live a life that demands the
physical power he will grow into. The strongest man on Beals Island
tapped the side of his head. ``It's all up here now,'' he said.

   After washing our hands, a friend and I opened the specially
designed carton and removed the 14 booklets that constitute the
2-pound Timothy McSweeney's Issue No. 4. ``If none of the stuff
inside is any good,'' he said as we eyed the lovely and peculiar
covers, ``it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   McSweeney's is tricky to describe, much less pigeonhole. To be
grossly reductive, the writing tends to be smart and funny, hip but
not snide, mostly fiction, essays, and letters. The editor, Dave
Eggers, is author of the memoir ``A Heartbreaking Work of
Staggering Genius,'' and his writing sets the quarterly's tone and
often outshines other contributors. (The booklet titled ``Notes and
Background and Clarifying Charts and Some Complaining,'' is his
doing and is laugh-out-loud good, with, appropriately for this
issue, an author's bill of rights on book design and a memorable
line that reads, ``IF YOU ARE SENDING POETRY: please do not.'')
</P>
<P>
   The boxed set is not only a quiet triumph in concept and design
(even the page numbers look good), it's pretty on the inside. The
range of material is broad and unruly, from a letter on nationalism
to alternate takes on ``The Egg'' by Sherwood Anderson and ``The
Trial'' by Franz Kafka. Twelve of the issue's booklets consist of
just one piece by one author, 11 of whom provided artwork for their
covers _ from professional designs to a child's scrawl.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the set are ``Notes'' and a booklet of ``Shorter
Stories'' by several writers. Amid company that includes Rick
Moody, Haruki Murakami, Lydia Davis, George Saunders, and Sarah
Vowell, the pick of the litter may be Denis Johnson's ``Hellhound
on My Trail,'' a three-part play that springs from a workplace
investigation about a woman, a man, and a proposition involving a
jar of jam. There's not a dull bit of dialogue among six characters
in nearly 70 brisk pages.

(www.mcsweeneys.org and www.mcsweeneys.net), check there for a list

   Not infrequently, The Atlantic Monthly will run a story that
makes you impatient for the cross-fire and, potentially, some
rearrangement of the truth that will come from letters to the
editor. Such is the case with the May cover story, ``The War
Against Boys,'' by the controversial Christina Hoff Sommers, author
of the 1994 book ``Who Stole Feminism?'' and W. H. Brady Fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers scoffs at the much-publicized notion that girls are
shortchanged in American schools, and presents evidence that
``shows boys, not girls, on the weak side of an education gender
gap.'' Among her conclusions: ``The typical boy is a year and a
half behind the typical girl in reading and writing; he is less
committed to school and less likely to go to college.'' She
maintains that girls participate more than boys do in
extracurricular activities other than sports, and that boys are
more likely to be held back or drop out, become involved in crime,
use alcohol and other drugs, and have a diagnosis of
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers bases her provocative assertions on data from such
sources as the US Department of Education and the National Center
for Education Statistics. She makes a compelling case for the claim
that boys need more attention in school, but in doing so sounds
just as one-sided as some of the people she criticizes.
</P>
<P>
   In her first paragraph, Sommers suggests that the US women's
soccer team symbolizes ``the spirit of American girls'' and
Columbine High School is an analog for boys, an idea that is sure
to inflame. She reports that in 1997 five times as many boys killed
themselves as girls, while glossing over the fact that
significantly more girls attempt suicide than boys. All of this
makes a reader eager to hear from calmer voices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Sommers's objections to studies conducted by Harvard's
Carol Gilligan and other researchers are justified (she takes them
to task for flawed methodology, politicized arguments about
``demoralized teenage girls,'' and/or for not making data public),
someone's got explaining to do. But Sommer's tone is irksome, her
language hyperbolic. She refers to the ``manufactured crisis of
diminished girls'' and says that Gilligan's central thesis these
days is ``that boys are being imprisoned by conventional ideas of
masculinity.'' Let the letters roll.

   April's MAMM (published 10 times a year and subtitled ``Women,
Cancer and Community'') is a special issue on complementary and
alternative medicine. The opening letter from editor Gwen Darien
refers to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
last June showing that 28 percent of Massachusetts women with
early-stage breast cancer used such treatments. Darien writes that
MAMM ``examines that trend with both the skeptic's eye and the
believer's heart'' and says ``chemotherapy saved my life, yoga made
it bearable.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has articles about quacks (illustrated with incredible
ads provided by the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices in
Minneapolis), Chinese medicine, Buddhism, and journal writing. In a
longer story, writer and editor Cynthia L. Cooper talks about
complementary medicines with three providers &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All three practitioners discuss approaches that can accompany _
not replace _ Western treatment. Webster runs 10-week stress
management groups with cancer patients and says the program's
assessments show ``statistically significant reductions in
depression and anxiety.'' (For MAMM subscription information, call

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... was accepted.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terrified to fail and determined to distinguish herself, Murray
studied wherever she could find a place to sit and managed to
complete four years of high school in two, graduating with grades
``in the high 90s,'' Weiner says. Even he was not aware that she
was homeless. ``I knew she stayed at friends' houses a lot. . . .
New York is a very profound and unusual city. The lives of students
are really quite unfathomable here. I know kids who slept on
rooftops. I didn't question it closely. I knew her mother had died
of AIDS, but she didn't say much about her life.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that Murray ``was one of our really smartest kids in
a school full of smart kids. She was obviously driven. I think
persistence is a big part of her success here.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner describes her as ``genteel'' but also sad, yet ``very
personable and funny, and fun-loving in her own way. She is also a
very single-minded person, very intellectual, with a real love of
learning. She knew she needed to go to a very, very good college.
That was her agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Her opportunity came when she was selected as one of 10 top
students at the academy to take a field trip to Boston. ``That's
when she found out about Harvard,'' says Weiner. ``That's when she
had her first ecstatic vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Harvard Yard, she had a look of pure awe on her
face, Weiner recalls. He says he knew what she was thinking. ``I
just walked over to her and said, `It's very improbable, but still
possible.' In fact, it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials declined to answer specific questions about
Murray's application, but indicate she fell into a particular
category of student the university looks for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at: How will this person contribute to the education
of his or her fellow classmates?'' says William Fitzsimmons, dean
of admissions and financial aid. ``And, based on the record of
accomplishments this person has, what can we guess about what kind
of contributions to society will this person make over his or her
lifetime? Given the cards this person has been dealt, how has this
person been able to maximize his or her opportunities? Has this
person reached out to others, served to stimulate and inspire
others? These are the standards we apply to everyone, and the
standards we applied to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has answered questions about her life's developments so
often her answers sound almost rote by now.
</P>
<P>
   Is she excited about going to Harvard, she is asked over lunch
at a diner in the Bronx. ``I've been to Boston all of a few
hours,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``It seems like a place I could
get used to.''
</P>
<P>
   What does she want for her future?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, to have good people surrounding me whom I love and
who love me back. To live every day to the fullest, cliche as that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a directness, almost a flatness to Murray's responses,
that suggests she is weary of certain aspects of her newfound
celebrity. Indeed, when a student at PS 95 asked if she ever felt
sorry for herself while she was homeless, her answer was an
immediate no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt sorry for myself. That is a useless emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Until she starts school in the fall, she is keeping feverishly
busy. She has an apartment in the Bronx she shares with a friend.
She works as a clerk for The New York Times. She keeps a hectic
schedule of appointments, including going to the dentist for the
first time since she was 9. She sees her father frequently _ ``He
lives in the Bronx and has AIDS, but he's doing very well; his
viral load is undetectable and his T cells are up.'' She sees her
sister occasionally; she lives in the Bronx too, but they don't get
along well, Murray says. She has a boyfriend and a lot of friends
from her homeless days, whom she is helping out with money ``and in
every way I can.'' And she makes frequent appearances at schools
and other venues where she talks about the subjects close to her
heart: the danger of using drugs, the importance of embracing every
day, her disdain for people who have an ``apathy for living.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the manuscript she is working on, a draft of a
book about her life. ``Candice'' gave her the name of her own
literary agent, who has asked to see it. Another agent she met
plans to talk to Jodie Foster about Murray's life as a potential
movie project.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the shifts in her life is not lost on her, but she
is no longer consumed with how strange it is. ``For a long time I
kept saying that this makes no sense. But I think my life has
taught me it makes perfect sense. Everything I've experienced has
taught me that things in life can change in an instant. But this is
that lesson on a positive level, and it seems so gratifying and
exciting at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she says, she would relinquish all the
literary agents and talk shows in the world for just one thing,
something so simple most people take it for granted. ``Sometimes I
go to my friends' houses and hear them call for their mom. Or I am
with my sister and father and see an empty place where my mother
should be. If I could trade what I have now for that, I absolutely
would.''

FRESHENING UP THE TRADITIONAL EASTER DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The same ingredients seem to find their way onto the spring
holiday table every year, and yet they always seem fresh. Maybe it
has to do with the weather finally warming up, or the family
collecting in one place, or the children spending a morning hunting
for colored eggs. Perhaps it's the ending: strawberries heaped onto
shortcake. After all, cake, berries, and whipped cream are one of
the happiest combinations imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   So you don't need to reinvent the Easter menu each year. But you
can take what you already do and incorporate other ideas. All those
Easter-hunt eggs can find a use, halved and deviled, the yolks
mixed with mayonnaise, hot sauce, and paprika and stuffed back into
the shells. For a main course, rub a butterflied leg of lamb with
French mustard and herbs before roasting it in a hot oven. Pass a
cooling yogurt-mint sauce, slow-roasted onion wedges sprinkled with
balsamic vinegar, and a sheet of thinly sliced, golden brown
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's shortcake time: billows of whipped cream, lightly
sweetened, sandwiched with berries in a simple butter cake, topped
with more berries. The only thing more satisfying would be curling
up on the couch late at night, polishing off a handful of chocolate
Easter eggs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
DEVILED EGGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup mayonnaise or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Generous dash of Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Generous dash of liquid hot sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon anchovy paste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon good-quality paprika
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Small handful Italian parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   Extra paprika (for sprinkling)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Use a straight pin or an open safety pin to poke a very tiny
hole in the rounded end of each egg. Bring a large pan of water to
a boil and use a slotted spoon to lower the eggs into the water.
Move quickly. When all are added, use the spoon to make the eggs
start rotating in a circle. Continue moving them round and round
until the water returns to a boil. Then stir for 1 minute. (This
helps set the yolks in the center of the eggs.)
</P>
<P>
   Start counting from the moment the water returns to a boil. At
exactly 12 minutes, lift the eggs from the water and transfer them
to ice water. Let them sit for 10 minutes or until they are cold.
To hasten this, you can tap the eggs gently on the counter and
remove a strip of the shell from each one. Then return them to
their ice bath until they are cold.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the eggs by tapping them on the counter. Dry them with
paper towels. Halve them horizontally. Scoop the yolks into a bowl.
Cut the tiniest possible slice from the rounded bottoms of the
whites so they sit without rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Mash the yolks with the mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, hot
sauce, mustard, anchovy paste, paprika, salt, and pepper. Add more
mayonnaise if the mixture is too thick. Taste for seasoning and
make the mixture spicier if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Use a teaspoon to mound the filling on each egg white. Smooth it
around the edges. Arrange the eggs on a platter. Set a parsley leaf
on 18 of the eggs, decorating clusters of eggs and leaving the
empty ones here and there. Dip the tip of a paring knife into the
paprika and sprinkle a little paprika on one edge of each egg
(including those with parsley). Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

BUTTERFLIED LEG OF LAMB MARINATED IN MUSTARD WITH PROVENCAL HERBS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 leg of lamb (6 to 7 pounds), boned, butterflied, and well
trimmed of fat
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, cut into slivers
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, oregano,
marjoram)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wipe the lamb with paper towels. Set it boned side up in a large
roasting pan. In several spots, you'll see that the meat is higher
and thicker than the rest of the leg. Use a paring knife to make
1/2-inch horizontal slashes in these thick parts so the meat cooks
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Use the paring knife to make small slits all over the meat, and
insert the garlic slivers into the slits. Rub both sides the with
oil, mustard, herbs, salt, and pepper. Set the meat in the pan fat
side up (there shouldn't be much fat). Cover it tightly with
plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least a half-day or for as long as
2 days.
</P>
<P>
   Before cooking, let the lamb sit at room temperature for 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 425 degrees. Roast the lamb for 15 minutes.
Carefully turn it over and continue roasting for 15 to 25 minutes
or until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the
thickest part of the lamb registers 125 to 130 degrees for rare
meat (135 to 145 degrees for medium).
</P>
<P>
   Let the lamb sit in a warm place for 5 minutes. Carve into
slices for serving.

   Serves 8.

YOGURT-MINT SAUCE &QL;

   2 cups whole-milk or low-fat yogurt

<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grated raw onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   Dash of liquid hot sauce

<P>
   Olive oil (for drizzling)
</P>
<P>
   3 scallions, chopped (for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, whisk the yogurt until it is smooth. On a board, with
a blunt knife, mash the crushed garlic with a pinch of salt until
the garlic liquefies. Use a spoon to stir the garlic into the
yogurt. Stir in the onion, mint, and hot sauce. Taste for seasoning
and add more hot sauce if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the yogurt to a bowl, drizzle olive oil on top, and
garnish with scallions. Serve at once.

SLOW-ROASTED EXTRA SWEET ONIONS

   5 Vidalia, Walla Walla, Sugar Babies, or other extra-sweet
onions
</P>
<P>
   Balsamic vinegar (for sprinkling)

<P>
   Olive oil (for sprinkling)

   Small handful fresh parsley leaves

</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 350 degrees. Have on hand a large shallow baking
dish that is nice enough to go to the table later.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the onions and trim the roots just to discard the dark
ends, but keep the root intact. Cut each onion into 8 wedges,
keeping a piece of root on each one so the wedges hold together.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the onions in the dish, cut sides up. Sprinkle with the
vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper. Cover the dish with foil, shiny
side down. Roast the onions for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the foil, baste the onions with the juices in the pan,
and continue roasting for 40 to 50 minutes or until the edges are
beginning to brown and the onions are meltingly tender.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can make the onions in advance and set them aside.
Just before serving, reheat them in the same oven with the potatoes
and lamb (make sure the baking dish will withstand that high heat)
for 15 minutes or until hot.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Chop together the thyme and parsley. Sprinkle them on
the onions, add more black pepper, and serve at once.

POTATO SHEET
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Olive oil (for pan and sprinkling)
</P>
<P>
   6 medium Idaho or russet potatoes, peeled and left in cold water
</P>
<P>
   1 half-gallon whole milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have on hand a jellyroll pan that won't buckle. Otherwise, use a
roasting pan. Lightly oil the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 425 degrees. Use a mandoline or other slicing
machine (not a food processor) to cut the potatoes lengthwise into
1/8-inch slices. You can also do this with a long chef's knife.
</P>
<P>
   In a large flameproof casserole, combine the milk with a
half-carton of water. Add plenty of salt and bring the milk to a
boil. Remove the pot from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   As the potatoes are sliced, add them to the milk mixture. When
all are added, return the milk to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 3
minutes or until they are almost tender. Watch them carefully so
they don't fall apart (they cook more later).
</P>
<P>
   Use a wide slotted spatula to lift the potatoes from the cooking
liquid, tap them to drain the excess liquid, and transfer them to
the jellyroll pan. Arrange them overlapping in haphazard layers.
Sprinkle the top with oil, salt, and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the potatoes to the hot oven and roast them for 45
minutes or until they are golden brown on top. Use a wide metal
spatula to transfer them to a warm platter. The potatoes will not
stay together in neat squares, but that's OK. Serve at once.

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes for shortcake call for individual biscuits. This
recipe, from a 30-year-old Pillsbury cookbook, makes a simple,
light biscuit-style cake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the berries and cream:
</P>
<P>
   1 quart strawberries
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 heaping tablespoons confectioners' sugar, plus extra for
sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Granulated sugar (for berries)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: Set the oven at 375 degrees. Grease a 9-inch round
cake pan and dust it with flour, tapping out the excess.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Stir in the sugar. Then use a pastry blender to cut the butter into
the flour until the mixture resembles bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the milk, eggs, and vanilla. Pour the liquid ingredients
into the flour mixture all at once, and stir only until all the dry
ingredients are moist.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and spread it evenly.
Bake the cake for 30 minutes or until the top springs back when
pressed with a fingertip.
</P>
<P>
   Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Then turn it out
and set it on a rack right side up to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Split the cake horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the cake: Hull the berries and halve them
lengthwise.

DESPITE TECH ROUT, FUND CHIEF IS STILL BULLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   You might have expected Ben Hock to be rattled.
</P>
<P>
   It was Friday, the Nasdaq Stock Market was plunging, Hock's
growth fund was plunging with it, and Frank Sinatra was singing
``That's Life'' in the background of the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hock, manager of the AIM Global Growth Fund, was taking the
news in stride. A longtime stock market and technology bull, first
at John Hancock Funds, now at AIM in Houston, Hock was in Boston
last week to meet with clients. His fund was up 52 percent last
year; at the close of the market Monday it was down nearly 11
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hock took some time out of his schedule to chat with us about
the market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you still bullish?
</P>
<P>
   A. I am still bullish. Pummeled recently, but still bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you surprised by this dramatic sell-off?
</P>
<P>
   A. You are always surprised by severe movements. We had a luxury
for a time. We had not seen anything like this since 1998, and
things got overextended. We are just letting a little air out of
stocks that probably shouldn't have gotten to such lofty valuations
in the first place. The Nasdaq was up 86 percent last year. That
was a big number, and everyone knew it was a big number.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've always been a tech fan. Do you still own a lot of
technology stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you look at the holy trinity _ technology, communications,
media _ they probably account for more than 40 percent of our
holdings. But remember, they are more than 40 percent of the S&AMP;P
also. That reflects the transformation of the US economy. Where do
you find earnings growth? In technology. And those earnings are
still superb. They may be up 35 percent this quarter. It's also
important to remember that technology spending is global. If you
are in Korea and Germany you have to lower your costs, and that
means more technology. Technology spending begets more technology
spending. Computers are like potato chips. You can't buy just one.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What specifically do you like in the tech sector?
</P>
<P>
   A. We remain extremely excited about the mobile-phone market.
The Europeans are still the leaders there. If you are in Finland
you can take your mobile phone, point it at a soft-drink machine,
and get a Coke. Before long, mobile phones are going to replace all
the date planners and Palm Pilots. Among the big names, we still
like EMC, Cisco, and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How about outside the technology world?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the unsung stories of this market is that earnings
will be strong in lots of other sectors. We are getting a
broadening out in the market. We love retailers, for example. We
think they are an absolute layup in this market. Their customers
have jobs, incomes are rising, and they can buy cheap goods
overseas. When Kmart's earnings go up 17 percent in one quarter,
this is a very good market for retailers. Other areas that look
attractive are advertising stocks and media stocks. I am not trying
to be Pollyanna-ish, but the basic building blocks look good to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aren't you afraid that Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan will raise rates and spoil the party?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think what Greenspan is trying to do is just put some
insurance into the system, and he would rather do that when times
are good. He has raised rates five times, and he may have two more
rate hikes in him. I think he would like to get out of the way
before the elections. The (consumer price index) was a little
higher on the core rate (Friday), but overall inflation really
hasn't budged much. In the fourth quarter, productivity was so
strong that unit labor costs actually fell. That is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you lie awake at night and worry, what do you worry
about?
</P>
<P>
   A. You always worry that you may be too optimistic. Then there
are always wild cards. Could there be a debt crisis? Does Japan
sink back deeper into recession? The Russian situation remains
unstable. Any of those things could occur, but I can't help it if
they do. I can't plan for the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think this sell-off will scare off the average
investor?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't see any evidence of that. In fact, I think the
individual investor has been a net buyer right through this period.
He has been conditioned to step in when the market is down. I think
it would take a prolonged period of bad days to break that
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hock apparently isn't the only one who is still willing to
put his money into technology.
</P>
<P>
   Qauntum Bridge Communications, an Internet infrastructure
company in North Andover, Mass., has raised $102 million in a
third-round financing. The round was led by Texas Pacific Group; a
long list of venture investors participated.
</P>
<P>
   The company is building a system it says is capable of providing
business customers with bandwidth services that are significantly
faster than existing alternatives.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Halogen lights glinting off the mud puddles of an ugly
cold March night, and the spring cry goes up: ``Blue! Yellow!
Purple! . . . Baaaaall!''
</P>
<P>
   Out of a tangle of bare-skinned legs an oversized loaf of a
football squiggles free, and as it is snatched up, the grunting
confusion turns suddenly to motion and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Chang picks up the ball and runs, bursts through a swarm of
arms, gets tackled high, spins and laterals the ball to Archerbault
running full speed out on the wing. She sprints 10 troubled yards
before a pair of big arms wraps her up and throws her in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooof! Baaalll!''
</P>
<P>
   Play is momentarily stopped, instruction rendered as coach Jan
Rutkowski makes a fine point about stringing out the attack, and
with a sharp whistle, the grunting and whacking sound of bodily
collisions continue: The women of the Beantown Rugby Football Club
of Boston are getting ready to take on the world.
</P>
<P>
   This team has a host of enemies to dispatch, including the
Berkeley All-Blues and the Maryland Stingers, on their way to what
they hope will be their seventh national championship in a 10-year
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won it since '96,'' says Rutkowski, a former Regis
basketball and soccer standout. ``We want to do it again this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks of indoor training, the first snowfree days of
March bring the Beantowns out to Smith Field across from Harvard
Stadium, where they begin practice every Tuesday and Thursday
night, getting ready for the schedule that takes them to several
cities throughout the country, ultimately to Berkeley, Calif., in
mid-June for the Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   When the Beantowns were established in 1976, women's rugby was
about as rare as women's ice hockey. But, says Beantown assistant
coach Joan Morrissey, the need to find a collegiate fall sport
helped popularize rugby and make it the nation's fastest growing
sport among women.
</P>
<P>
   Full body contact, thrashing tackles, and jarring straightarms
with no pads or helmets, an oversized football to control, and
nonstop sprinting _ thundering sprints with 30 women on two teams _
are the marks of this English sport that is played widely
throughout Europe and the Commonwealth Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the US version _ called ``gridiron'' in countries that
play rugby (``football'') _ is a spinoff from the sport that was
first played in England in the 1850s. Rugby, in turn, had spun off
soccer, and a plaque commemorating the game's origin reads ``With a
fine disregard for the rules of (soccer), he (William Ellis) picked
up the ball and ran with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, when Ellis ran with the ball 150 years ago, he had no
idea that Alex Williams might be upfield waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 inches, 195 pounds, with legs that chug like
pistons, Williams, a Watertown native, is captain of the Beantowns.
There is a picture of her on the team Web page breaking past a
Berkeley tackler, running full ahead, a vicious straightarm having
thrown the defender back on her heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game that gets rid of tension,'' says the
consultant turned carpenter who started the rugby team while a
student at Radcliff in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Williams still plays the game with passion, stopping in
practice to explain fine points to the younger players. ``I always
want to play rugby to the best of my ability,'' says Williams, who
sees the team like a big family that grows tighter by the year,
``to continue to learn, and to pass on what I know to younger
players whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the very embodiment of the Beantowns. After
windsprints she gets the whole team, 30 or so mudcaked women
breathing hard and buzzing excitedly, into a scrum-like circle for
an inspirational pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel the spirit, going around. Going around. We made a few
mistakes. Let's learn from every mistake we make. Big squeeze.'' At
that, the team presses in tightly for a silent minute, then break
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the physical intensity,'' says Rutkowski, ``and the
skills to master. We play a finesse game. It's physically rough,
but the players have to learn a lot about finesse. Not just
knocking each other down.''
</P>
<P>
   Widely recognized as one of the top teams in the country, the
Beantown A-side _ top 15 _ has amassed an overall record of 482-32
since 1982, with 6 firsts, 3 seconds, and 5 thirds in National
Championship play. While they maintain a core of veterans, a few
new players are recruited each year from the college ranks, or from
other clubs, such as the Boston Women's Rugby Football Club, who
provide local competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge part of our lives,'' says Alex. ``In college,
you have the college connections, but here the team becomes our
social life and our connections more than just a sport we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women stay at the game for 20 years, and play actively well
into their 30s. At the other end of the spectrum is Jenny von
Knoblauch, an 18-year-old exchange student from Germany who works
out with Beantown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing sport,'' she says. ``You just run run run all
the time. It's a sport where you really do something.''
</P>
<P>
   From doctors, lawyers, teachers, and social workers, the
Beantown women come from all walks, bound by the love for a game so
fresh and young in this country it so far defies the
over-organization that follows so many recreational sports.
</P>
<P>
   When the team travels to play in California, or even Europe, the
opposing players act as hosts to the visitors. ``That way we all
become very unified. We're all friends,'' says Morrissey. ``It
really is like one huge family.''
</P>
<P>
   Says one woman as she kneads her quad muscles with a rolling pin
after practice: ``There's just nothing that anyone here would
rather be doing tonight than be right here, playing rugby. It's the
most addictive thing there is. You start it for a little while, and
pretty soon, it's all you think about, looking ahead to the next
game, the next practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the nonstop, no-substitution action makes this brand
of rugby nearly as compelling to watch as it is to play. The
Beantowns play weekly through June, then enter the national
tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with the lowest unemployment rate in decades and a
shortage of skilled labor, established brick-and-mortar companies
and upstart Internet firms are waging an intense battle for
recruits on the nation's college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   University counselors say recruiting by dot-com and old-economy
companies began earlier this year and is notable for higher
first-year salary offers. Companies are even making full-time
offers to first-year MBA students to lock in commitments early.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is so intense that one Internet firm, Trilogy
Software of Austin, Texas, placed a full-page ad in a student
newspaper near Cornell University's campus in Ithaca, N.Y., last
month promising an annual base salary of $200,000, plus benefits,
and a new BMW 323-Ci coupe to the top five seniors with technical
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Such offers and the feeling among many young people that
new-economy companies provide the best path to quick riches have
given Internet start-ups a big advantage in the recruiting wars.
But just as it seemed that many established companies were being
left behind, the sharp downturn in technology stocks that began
March 10 and continued last week appears to be realigning the
battlefield. Suddenly, stock options _ the lure many dot-com
companies use to attract talent _ are not as attractive in a
volatile market where paper riches can evaporate in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that prospects may be getting skittish about signing
with Internet companies, old-line firms are pouncing with promises
of high salaries and, perhaps most important, stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two weeks we have seen a significant upswing in
accepts for our summer hires for full-time work,'' said Harry
Cederbaum, director of US university recruitment for Booz-Allen &AMP;
Hamilton Inc., a New York consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, consulting was a hot area that had its
pick of graduates. But like law firms and brokerage houses,
consulting companies have been hard put to compete in the new
high-tech economy. Now Cederbaum says the pendulum may be starting
to swing back to the traditional professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think students are beginning to reassess the risk'' of
joining start-ups, said Cederbaum, whose firm pays new hires with
an MBA $120,000 to $135,000 to start. ``We thought the year was
going to be tough because of the competition. Instead, it has been
extraordinary.'' He said the firm wanted to hire 120 interns, most
of whom will be offered full-time jobs after the summer, ``and
we've gone beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, employment specialists say that graduating seniors and
MBAs will continue to gravitate to the Internet world, but are
likely to focus on growing dot-com companies that have cleared some
initial hurdles and shown that they can survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of momentum and opportunity among the
better established dot-coms,'' said Wayne E. Cooper, president and
chief executive of New Hampshire-based Kennedy Information, which
tracks the recruitment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people already know that there is a fundamental shift
going on now in our economy, and they know the Internet firms are
the future,'' Copper added. ``So what the dip in technology stocks
will do is make students more discerning.'' He said that marginal
firms will have trouble attracting and keeping talent, but that
``those going to the quality dot-coms will likely tough through
this period because they realize the prospects will be brighter in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to hire, Internet firms are bypassing traditional
recruitment strategies and contacting potential candidates
directly, either through the Internet, through the friends of
student interns, or during class presentations and visits.
</P>
<P>
   Brad O'Neill, 28, dropped out of the MBA program at Babson
College last year to join StorageNetworks, an Internet data storage
firm in Waltham, Mass.. After a company official spoke to his
class, O'Neill introduced himself. He was offered a job on the spot
and went to work two days later, first as an intern. He became a
full-time employee in several weeks. He now is responsible for
directing corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who would have graduated this year, said he did not
want to wait ``to be at the center of the world in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Few companies actually offer that opportunity,'' said O'Neill.
``So, if you see that there is a chance, that rare chance, well,
you want to be a part of that, and you want to be part of it
quickly and early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato Monaco, 28, will receive an MBA in June from the Amos
Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., but
the offers started coming last year. After considerable research,
he chose Bowstreet, an established New Hampshire Internet firm that
develops Web infrastructure for businesses. He received stock
options in the company as part of his compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I would miss a tremendous opportunity if I didn't
accept their job offer,'' Monaco said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nasdaq's recent tumble, he said: ``I think the market
will turn around. I am not concerned that, in terms of my equity,
my position will no longer be valuable. I'm in this for the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the dot-coms, established old-economy
companies have increased their salaries and benefits in an attempt
to keep pace with the Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Booz-Allen engaged in a bit of
soul-searching. ``We began asking ourselves how to go about
competing against the dot-coms,'' Cederbaum said. ``We know that
the work we're doing is hot. We do e-business with the traditional
analysis, and the ability to teach e-business to traditional
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   When the company evaluated its Web-based competitors, it found
that, in addition to stock options, many were offering an
unstructured entrepreneurial environment that promised increased
mobility and the chance to make a lot of money in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   So, Booz-Allen has made some changes. It now accepts equity in
companies it advises in lieu of cash payments _ stock it then
divides among its young consultants, who are called associates. The
result is that the company is optimistic again about attracting
top-flight talent from colleges and business schools.
</P>
<P>
   But some who track both traditional and Internet consulting
firms say the new-economy businesses have the upper hand. The
old-line firms once hired as many as 35 percent of the best
graduates from the nation's top 10 schools, said Marshall Cooper,
executive editor of Consultants News. Now these students are
flocking to hot Internet consulting firms like Razorfish in New
York, and Viant and Zefer in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the established firms have more business than they can
handle and not enough good people. The campuses, both undergraduate
and graduate, used to be their domain,'' Cooper said. ``But now
there is leakage to the dot-coms, and older consultancies are no
longer in the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   As the battle between old-line and new-line firms continues, the
main beneficiaries will continue to be college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, we are seeing substantial, sometimes even
spectacular, increases over what employers offered last year,''
said Camille Luckenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the National
Association of Colleges and Employers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Marc Perlman, 22, who will graduate from Cornell in
June with a bachelor's degree in engineering. Anderson Consulting
in New York offered him $54,000 a year to start and a variety of
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Trilogy Software offered Perlman $69,000 a year, plus a
stock option package that contained 1,200 shares. He accepted and
is amazed by his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have, in one year, surpassed my dad's salary,'' said
Perlman, whose father is a freelance photographer.

CANADIANS OPPOSE PLAN TO RELOCATE GRIZZLIES TO THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ When the Yanks started running off with the lynx, no
one paid mind. Canada's got lynx aplenty, so the attitude was: Help
yourself, neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife
spirited off entire packs of gray wolves for transplant to
Yellowstone National Park, quite a few Canadians _ ranchers,
especially _ cheered good riddance to critters often despised as a
predatory nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But an American grab for grizzly bears is getting growls from
Canadian environmental groups and ordinary folk, although prominent
wildlife biologists in the country support the ambitious if
little-noticed plan to reintroduce North America's fiercest land
mammal to Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, the Wildlife Service hopes to start capturing small
numbers of grizzlies in the rugged Kootenay region of southeastern
British Columbia. The creatures will be freed in the
Selway-Bitterroot wilderness, a 25,140-square-mile region covering
much of east-central Idaho and extending into Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Activist groups in British Columbia and Alberta are beating the
drums against the scheme. Canada may boast far more grizzlies than
the Lower 48 states, they say _ but that doesn't mean it has bears
to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have this idea of Canada as untrammeled wilderness
just teeming with whatever wildlife gets finished off down there,''
said Michael Sawyer of the Castle-Crown Wilderness Coalition. ``But
we're on a slide toward the grizzly becoming endangered, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the project has taken on an anti-American tone,
with critics complaining that the US treats Canada as a bottomless
reservoir of wild species.
</P>
<P>
   Remarked one provincial environmental official: ``There's
definitely some resentment at the way you people treat our
wilderness as a sort of `Wolves `R' Us.' '' Many of the major
species reintroduction programs undertaken by the US Wildlife
Service rely on animals from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's no question that Canadian grizzlies are
hard-pressed in many of their home ranges these days, especially in
booming Alberta, where logging operations, agriculture, resorts,
roads and an expanding web of busy hiking trails are intruding on
critical bear habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, according to leading wildlife biologists, British
Columbia still possesses such an abundance of the giant beasts _
upwards of 10,000 _ that the removal of a few dozen would not harm
the population. They note that bringing bears to Idaho will mark a
huge leap for a long-range dream of restoring grizzlies to a
1,700-mile corridor stretching from Yukon Territory to Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary effort to restore grizzlies to a
wilderness where they've been completely wiped out,'' said Stephen
Herrero, professor of environmental science at Alberta's University
of Calgary and one of Canada's foremost bear experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never been done in North America,'' he said. ``It seems
a good and neighborly use of British Columbia bears.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the project is to revive a species all but eradicated
from the contiguous states. More than 50,000 grizzlies prowled the
American West before the arrival of 19th Century settlers. Today
there are only 1,000 in scattered pockets, mainly in Yellowstone
and Glacier national parks. (An estimated 35,000 grizzlies thrive
in Alaska, but their habitat is so different they are considered
unsuitable for transplant to the high Rockies.)
</P>
<P>
   The last lonely grizzly inhabiting the Bitterroot wilderness was
bagged by a hunter in the mid-1940s, according to the Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Idaho is a historic habitat for grizzly bears, but
there are none left,'' said Johnna Roy, a wildlife biologist with
the Service's Grizzly Bear Recovery project. ``We want to bring
this magnificent species back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Wildlife Service's primary missions is to revive
populations of endangered species _ from wolves to whooping cranes,
grizzlies to black-footed ferrets _ restoring them to their
original habitats where possible.
</P>
<P>
   For example, earlier this month 30 Canadian lynx captured in
Yukon Territory and British Columbia were released in Colorado's
high country, part of a program to restore the cat to its old
American haunts.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction programs can be extremely controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, for instance, Rocky Mountain ranchers
have howled bloody murder as Wildlife Service biologists
transplanted hundreds of wolves from Alberta to Wyoming and Idaho,
where they've occasionally preyed on sheep, calves and other
livestock _ and, most alarming to ranchers, foraged boldly into
neighboring states. ``Those Canadian wolves treat this place as one
big lunch counter,'' said Jake Cummins of the Montana Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers and farmers have demanded a wolf slaughter. But a US
Appeals Court ruled this year that the wolf reintroduction program
serves a legitimate ecological purpose, and that the Canadian
wolves must not be molested.
</P>
<P>
   Now similar objections are greeting the proposed grizzly bear
project, which is undergoing final environmental review but seems
likely to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners of Custer County, Idaho recently passed a
resolution condemning the plan and ``authorizing'' the shooting of
any federally-protected grizzlies restored to the region _ although
the local prosecutor conceded the decree is probably illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, grizzlies almost certainly don't represent the
sort of threat to livestock posed by wolves. They are solitary
creatures _ each bear needs roughly 1,000 square miles of territory
in which to ramble _ and they usually keep as far as possible from
civilization. Moreover, 90 percent of their diet consists of
berries, bulbs, pine nuts, insects, roots and grasses. When they
eat meat, it's most likely to be carrion, usually dead fish or elk.
</P>
<P>
   But if sheep and cattle can relax, hikers and hunters will have
to tread a bit more warily into the Bitterroots if the grizzly is
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, griz can be grouchy on their home ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern is for human safety,'' said biologist Roy.
``When grizzlies come back, humans are going to have to stop
thinking of themselves as Number 1 in the forest,'' she said in an
interview from Idaho. ``That means practicing some precautions.
Like keeping clean campsites _ garbage attracts bears _ and hanging
their (hunting) kill out of reach. And not trying to take snapshots
of that big female with her cute cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Service's plan is to loose five grizzlies a year
into remoter parts of the region over five years, starting in 2001.
This seed stock of 25 bears should grow to an optimum population of
280 animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very long-term program,'' Roy said. ``We are looking at
50- to 110 years to reach that population level.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies take their name from the silver-tipped hairs
protruding from their shaggy brown coats. Males tip the scales at
600 pounds while females hardly qualify as petite, reaching 350
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bears from southeastern British Columbia are ideal for the
project because their habitat is most similar to conditions found
in the Bitterroot region. But some Canadians fret that their bears
will only be hauled off to their doom, claiming they will likely
fall prey to trigger-happy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much of a Wild West attitude down there, too many
guns,'' said Evelyn Kirkaldy of British Columbia's People's Action
for Threatened Habitat. ``The Americans killed out their own
grizzlies, and now they want ours. So of course we're alarmed.''

RUSSIAN JUDGE SETS OUT TO SALVAGE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In Moscow City Courtroom No. 329, two teenage
defendants sat glumly in a little red cage.
</P>
<P>
   They were on trial for the grisly murder of an elderly woman.
After their arrest, police had beaten both young men until they
confessed. The detectives wrapped one young man's head in
cellophane and savagely flogged him with a truncheon.
</P>
<P>
   This is criminal justice, Russian-style. You have the right to
remain silent _ but using it could land you in the hospital.
Police, under pressure to fulfill monthly arrest quotas, routinely
use torture to gather evidence. Prosecutors win convictions at
near-perfect rates. A trial is usually a formality, a guilty
verdict a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But these defendants were luckier than most. Judge Sergei Pashin
was hearing their case. Innocent or guilty, they at least stood a
chance of receiving a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pashin quizzed the accused, Andrei Mazayev and Pavel Sabadash,
about the police beatings. He offered them an opportunity to
retract their confessions, but neither did. Later, in his chambers,
Pashin said he would throw out the confessions anyway but conceded
that even without them, the case against the two was strong.
</P>
<P>
   Pashin, 37, has spent his career trying to turn Russia's courts
into something more than a rubber stamp for prosecutors. His
one-man quest, partially inspired by a visit to a Boston courtroom
eight years ago, has earned him the hostility of his colleagues and
almost cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's judicial system remains mostly unchanged since Soviet
times, when crime rates were low and it was assumed that the state
never make mistakes. But over the past decade, crime has
mushroomed, and police and prosecutors have come under pressure to
show results.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vladimir V. Putin has promised a ``dictatorship
of law'' for Russia. But whether the emphasis will be on
``dictatorship'' or on ``law'' depends largely on what happens to
the country's courts.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of fighting unsuccessfully for change, Pashin
himself is skeptical. Against stiff resistance, he has pushed for
jury trials, fought for independence for the courts, and tried to
prevent prosecutors from dictating judges' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the confines of our judicial system it is nearly impossible
to accomplish anything,'' Pashin said in an interview in his
chambers last week. ``With the police and prosecutors, everything
is possible _ torture, falsification of evidence, misconduct,
pressure on judges.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch found
widespread evidence that Russian police regularly use electroshock,
asphyxiation, and sustained beatings to extract confessions. An
independent judiciary might be able to confront such practices, but
Russia's courts are dependent on local authorities who want to
appear tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The cage in every Russian courtroom, where defendants sit during
their trials, is indicative of the ``guilty until proven innocent''
mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our courts are simply agents of punishment. Prosecutors
regularly pressure judges into reaching guilty verdicts,'' said
Rustem Maksudov of the Moscow-based Center for Judicial Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Russian judges are appointed for life terms by the president.
Their salaries, about $130 a month, come from the federal budget.
Local authorities, however, dole out benefits like housing and
healthcare, which judges rely on to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Pashin said prosecutors and other officials often call judges
and impress upon them the importance of making ``the right
decision'' _ and the consequences of making the wrong one. The best
he can do under the circumstances, he said, is to make his own
courtroom as fair and just as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He routinely throws out confessions obtained by torture and
meticulously reviews evidence for signs of falsification. As a
result, in a country where prosecutors boast a 99.65 percent
conviction rate, Pashin acquits about one out of every 10
defendants who walk into his courtroom. (That is about the same as
in the United States, where conviction rates hover around 90
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Pashin is the only real judge in Russia,'' said Maksudov. ``In
terms of professionalism and independence, I don't know of anyone
else like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated by Pashin's perceived leniency, prosecutors got him
thrown off the bench in 1998. He sued to get his job back and,
after an outcry in the media, was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   With his short blond hair, pinstriped shirt, and dark tie,
Pashin hardly looks like a radical. But in a country that is
burdened by rampant crime and fond of doling out draconian
punishments, his ideas are considered revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Boris Yeltsin appointed Pashin a judge in 1996,
when he was an adviser to the Kremlin on legal reform.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trip to the US District Court in Boston in 1992 that
helped inspire Pashin's desire for change. There, he watched a
criminal trial presided over by William Young, now the court's
chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   What Pashin saw in that courtroom made a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that the court was honest, interested only in
finding the truth. Judge Young was just brilliant. He was obviously
in love with the law,'' Pashin said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was also impressed by Pashin, whom he described as
``professional, personable and filled with intelligent and
perceptive questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said Pashin was particularly interested in how jury trials
work. Tsarist Russia used jury trials, but Communist authorities,
calling the practice a remnant of ``bourgeois justice,'' abandoned
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia's post-Soviet constitution guarantees the right to
trial by jury. But fierce opposition from prosecutors has meant
that jury trials are rare. Just nine of Russia's 89 regions use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 600 or so cases heard by juries each year, about 20
percent result in acquittals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a jury trial the prosecutor must prove his case. He can't
be certain in advance that he will win. Juries have more respect
for honest procedure and individual rights,'' Pashin said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, accustomed to being the arbiters of guilt and
innocence, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juries are an archaic institution from the 19th century. They
tend to make their decisions based on emotion,'' said Yury
Sinelshchikov, a Moscow prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to educate the public on the issue, Pashin recently
teamed up with privately-owned NTV television on a program called
``Court is In Session.'' The show gives convicted criminals a
chance at televised jury trials, with real judges and prosecutors.
The verdicts, however, have no legal force.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's premiere, Pashin presided over the ``trial'' Maxim
Shamarin. In 1995, a judge convicted Shamarin of double murder. The
jury, however, found the prosecution's evidence flimsy, and it
voted to acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't help Shamarin, who has spent the last five years in
prison.

<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ On a February night this past winter, an
estimated 78 million households tuned their televisions to the
Discovery Channel to hear Barry Clifford, bedecked in scuba diving
gear, break the water's surface of a small harbor off East Africa
and announce: ``Definitely, we have a big wreck here.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the show, everyone pretty much had concluded they
had the wreck of the infamous pirate William Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras had missed a conversation the swash-buckling
Clifford had had a few months earlier with his 17-year associate,
Kenneth Kinkor, a somewhat gangly, publicity-shy historian who has
spent a lifetime researching pirate culture.
</P>
<P>
   Both men recall the exchange went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Clifford: ``Ken, just how sure are you I'll find Kidd's ship?''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkor: ``Pretty darned sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford: ``I'm leading a major television crew 13,000 miles
around the world to a place at the left turn to nowhere. Ken, don't
embarrass me. Give me the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkor: ``Ninety-eight percent.''
</P>
<P>
   With such encouragement, Clifford went the distance and
eventually got to tell the world he believes he has found the
flagship of Kidd _ a man with Boston roots, no less. A confirmation
trip is scheduled shortly. Meanwhile, Kinkor, 46, went back to his
desk in a small, unkempt office at the end of Macmillan Wharf here.
No doubt he lit a pipe, opened some books, consulted some charts,
and pondered the next pirate mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one more example of how even an Iowa boy can quietly
tangle with the ghosts of history's saltiest seagoing legends,
emerge successful _ and, by choice, remain almost invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I call myself a piratetologist? Yes, I suppose I do. I like
the term. It has a counterelitist ring to it, much like the people
I study,'' Kinkor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional historians are like real estate agents; they
focus on the prominent features _ the kitchens and living spaces of
history,'' he said. ``I like like the dusty, musty crawl spaces
tunneled by the social dissidents who never wrote the books, who
never made the speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   He was reared in Calmar, Iowa (pop. 900), one of five children
raised on the salary of a rural letter carrier. Mom's name is
Clementine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, I stumbled across a 25-cent book at a sidewalk
sale that had once belonged to the DeCorah County Library,'' she
recalled during a telephone interview. ``It was Howard Pyle's `Book
of Pirates.' ``On the inside cover where borrowers had signed their
names was the name of my son. Two dozen times.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkor was reared on the magic of pirate stories read aloud.
Pirates were everywhere: on the curtains, on his wall paper, and
eventually a part of his master's thesis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Kinkor was midway through research at Illinois State
University on Palgrave Williams, a Rhode Island-born pirate of some
disrepute, when a television interview caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   A guy named Barry Clifford from Cape Cod was saying he had found
the 1717-wreck of the pirate ship Whydah just off the Cape
shoreline. Kinkor knew that Sam Bellamy, the Whydah's captain, was
a thieving good friend of Palgrave Williams. Perhaps Clifford would
want to know something about it?
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, as it turned out, had gotten a little ahead of himself
(not the first or last time), because he would not actually find
the Whydah until the following year.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Kinkor had already shelved the thesis, quit graduate
school, moved to Cape Cod, and become Clifford's right-hand man,
conserving and scrutinizing artifacts from the wreck, and becoming
ever more awed by the democracy and racial tolerance practiced
aboard pirate ships. The Clifford/Kinkor association persists to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkor is acting director of the Whydah Museum here, where
Clifford keeps an apartment upstairs. Clifford, a divorced father
of grown children, has turned adventure into a career and travels
the world exploring shipwrecks. Kinkor travels in a beat-up 1984
Honda Civic from Provincetown to his Eastham home daily. Last
autumn, he and his wife stretched the limits with a drive to
southern Maine. Otherwise he travels in books.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford is intimate, convincing, boyishly handsome, and
enthusiastic when a camera turns on. Kinkor turns the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, theirs is an association based on the principle that
opposites attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the brains,'' Clifford said the other day. It seemed rude
to ask what that made Clifford. Down moments have not eluded the
duo; failing to find some Boston Tea Party chests, and locating the
remnants of an English king's wardrobe in a Scottish lake, are two.
One thing is certain: They know how to have fun, and somehow call
it work.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ritchie, a biographer of Captain Kidd and the director of
research at the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., had this
to say about Kinkor: ``He's the guy who keeps Clifford's show on
the road. And he really knows his stuff,'' which includes facts
about a pirate that has become the stuff of legends.
</P>
<P>
   In 1697, Kidd ditched his flagship Adventure in the harbor of
Saint Marie, an island near Madagascar off the east coast of
Africa. Quality control had eluded Kidd for the entire voyage, his
crew _ undisciplined from the start _ was sick, hungry, frustrated
by the lack of spoils, and mutinous. He also had a leaking boat.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his crew left him to join another pirate. So Kidd ran
the Adventure up on a shoal, burned it to the waterline to salvage
what metal parts he could from the rigging, then bartered and
schmoozed his way back to the American colonies where he owned a
large house in New York City and, by today's standards, a condo in
Boston. It was in Boston that he was arrested for piracy.
</P>
<P>
   As Ritchie notes in ``Captain Kidd,'' a 300-page biography of
the pirate, Governor Richard Bellomont of Massachusetts could have
greeted the pirate with a handshake because the governor was an
investor in Kidd's plundering business. Instead, Bellomont greeted
him with irons. The governor had done the math and figured out that
he would get more for the reward than his portion of Kidd's assets.
So Kidd was shipped off to London and, in 1701 at the age of 56
years, hanged for piracy _ twice. The rope broke on the first
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Kinkor was researching the meanderings of
another pirate working the Madagascar neighborhood when he received
from a London archivist a copy of a curious document. It was a
lengthy, handwritten deposition by one Theophilus Turner who said
that in Saint Marie harbor ``there was likewise bottom of the
Adventure Galley in which Capt. Kidd sailed from New Yorke...''
</P>
<P>
   Piecing this reference together with facts culled from other
documents, Kinkor was able to lead Clifford to a section of a shoal
where he knew they would find the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The Adventure, which could also be rowed, was British-made. The
type of wood and hardware found by Clifford suggests he has the
right ship. The value of the find lies in artifacts that might
answer a few of the many questions historians have about pirate
life.
</P>
<P>
   It is conservatively estimated that 5,000 pirates plundered
trade in the early 18th century, a substantial force considering
the entire British Navy was roughly 15,000 strong at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pirate culture is poorly understood, yet what we do know
is often more interesting that romantic fiction,'' said Marcus
Rediker, a social historian at the University of Pittsburgh who has
written extensively about pirate culture.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Kinkor was captivated by the tales of buried bounty.
His quest now?
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine pirate log book,'' he said without hesitation.
Because for Ken Kinkor, the most valuable treasure lies in the
written word.

SAVING AGGRESSIVELY, CUTTING RISK MAY ALLOW RETIREMENT AT 55 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My company's 401(k) plan is restricted to the four funds I
hold; I contribute 12 percent of my annual income. What suggestions
would you have for my allocation, and at what age could I retire
comfortably if I assume that I can live on 70 percent of my
preretirement income? In addition, I will receive an after-tax
bonus of $43,000, which I would like to earmark for a home purchase
in the next five years. What do you think of the alternatives for
investing such a sum? I am fairly risk tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   D.D., Burlington, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a good week to get a hindsight view of risk in a
stock portfolio. For the week ended last Friday, the funds you are
using behaved about as you might expect, with Fidelity Growth and
Income losing 9.5 percent, Fidelity Magellan losing 12.1 percent,
and Fidelity Aggressive Growth falling a sickening 26.2 percent.
Fidelity Diversified International was off only 6.3 percent. But as
of Monday, it seemed that overseas markets were catching up, or
down, with Wall Street. Of the four funds, the only one with a
positive year-to-date return is Fidelity Growth and Income, up 3.8
percent. The largest loss so far in 2000 was 17.9 percent, for
Fidelity Aggressive Growth.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention how your contributions have been allocated,
but given the balances in the funds, it's not likely that they are
divided evenly. I would go with 32.5 percent each in Magellan and
Growth and Income, both large-cap blend funds. I'd put 20 percent
in Diversified International and 15 percent in Aggressive Growth.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest the relatively minor position in Aggressive Growth not
because it isn't a strong fund within its category, but because it
seems to me that the managers of funds in this category tend to
feel that more or less by charter they are instructed to take heavy
short-term risks, which can result in mediocre long-term results.
Funds with more moderate objectives tend to out-produce in the long
run, and both Fidelity Magellan and Fidelity Growth and Income fall
into this category and represent excellent positions that can be
viewed as core holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money that will likely be used for a home down
payment, even though you feel you can assume some risk, this is a
short-term savings project, and I would stay within traditional
short-term investment vehicles. The best rate on a one-year CD is
7.05 percent, and that's where I would go with that money.
</P>
<P>
   As for when you can retire, it's really a question of how much
you earn and save, and particularly how much bonus money you save.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with what you'll need. If we adjust a $77,000
current cost of living for an estimated 3.5 percent inflation rate,
you would need $148,032 a year at age 50, $175,816 at age 55,
$208,814 at 60, and $248,006 at 65.
</P>
<P>
   If you save $1,100 a month and the portfolio averages 10 percent
annual growth, the accumulations would be $1,221,412, 2,095,145,
3,531,700, and $5,700119, respectively. Based on those figures, the
target would probably fall somewhere between ages 60 and 65.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably your earnings will increase steadily during that
period, and if you continue to save 12 percent rather than a flat
$1,100 a month, the growth would speed up. And if you were to save
more than 12 percent of your bonuses after you achieve your real
estate goal, the accounts would grow even faster.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to follow such a course and achieve good earnings
increases and substantial bonuses, you could probably retire
between 55 and 60. Remember, when making these calculations you
want a substantial amount of money beyond what you will need to
produce an income stream, so you can invest money to protect you
against inflation later in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am self-employed social as a worker and try to contribute
the maximum to my SEP-IRA. My income isn't likely to go up greatly
in the future. I deposit money for the SEP-IRA into a credit union
account each week; every six to eight weeks I roll the accumulation
over into my funds. I have an $816 monthly mortgage payment, and
each month I pay $900 against the mortgage account. I do not have
other assets to speak of and am comfortable with my current level
of income. Are my investments sound? Am I investing enough? I don't
have dreams of being rich; I just want to save enough to live
comfortably in retirement, probably around age 65.
</P>
<P>
   D.B., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since you don't specify how much you are using to live on
now, I'm not sure how your retirement income is likely to compare.
If you continue saving at the current level and achieve average 10
percent annual investment gains, you would accumulate $1,034,590 by
age 65. If you then adjust that for an estimated 3.5 percent
inflation, it would be the equivalent of a little more than
$381,000 in today's money. It would be sufficient to provide an
income stream of $24,765 a year, based on an assumed 6.5 percent
yield from a fixed-income portfolio. If you combine such an income
stream with whatever Social Security benefits you can anticipate,
and assume a little additional growth, albeit modest, based on
higher future earnings, you should be in a fairly good situation.
</P>
<P>
   The big missing element here is the inflation that's likely to
occur after you retire. You should have some additional funds
stashed away in growth securities to provide a buffer. Two
suggestions: Plunge the lion's share of any unexpected funds you
may come across into a supplemental retirement savings plan. Or,
once your mortgage is paid off, divert what would have gone to
mortgage payments to that supplemental savings program.
</P>
<P>
   As for your portfolio, the funds are solid enough, and you have
touched the right bases. But I would be more comfortable if one of
the positions _ probably Citizens Index _ had a dominant, or core,
position. Moreover, both of the funds that would be most logical
for this position, Citizens Index and Alliance Premier Growth, are
a little too venturesome to be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   So I suggest you add a fund with a portfolio in the large-cap
blend arena, which you could eventually build to represent about 40
percent of the portfolio. You could then consign 40 percent of your
future investments to that fund, dividing the balance evenly among
the remaining holdings. My choice for the core position would be a
fund such as Vanguard Index 500, which doesn't have the
growth-oriented stance of Citizens investors. (It doesn't have
Citizens' focus on socially responsible holdings, either.)
</P>
<P>
   If you do build a supplemental retirement account, I would
suggest a solid and well-managed health care fund, such as a
Fidelity or Vanguard offering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: Here's a pep rally for retirement investors:
</P>
<P>
   After the horrors of last week, I'll bet a lot of you are
looking at your losses and wondering where this is getting you. Do
not despair, and make no hasty moves. Stock-market plunges are
inevitable, especially after a boom such as we have had in the past
five years or so. This, too, will pass.
</P>
<P>
   The critical thing is to have the stamina and the courage of
your convictions to keep stoking the fires. This is precisely the
season that makes the dollar-cost-averaging strategy work, and any
retirement plan is basically a dollar-cost-averaging plan, whether
you are putting $166 a month into an IRA or simply plunking down
$2,000 a year. In markets such as the current one, those regular
contributions will buy securities at lower prices, thereby bringing
your overall average cost down.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who get the willies and skip their contributions
because of worries about the market _ or who switch from stock
investments to CDs, bonds or other instruments _ will defeat the
dollar-cost-averaging plan at the very hour when it is designed to
serve them best. If you have an investment showing a year-to-date
loss of 20 percent or worse _ and there are plenty of them out
there _ it's tough to cut the check that puts still more money into
that holding. But if you're truly investing for the long term, it
is critical that you do so.

HOPING KNIGHT'S END ISN'T A DARK TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say a man chooses to defend Bob Knight. Is that something
like attempting to put in a good word for typhoid fever?
</P>
<P>
   You can't defend Knight, anyway. He wouldn't want you to. He'd
say he can take care of his own (censored) self, and he sure
doesn't need any (naughty word) help from the likes of you. He'd
say that his critics can kiss his (body area).
</P>
<P>
   He's in trouble. Have you heard? The people who want his silvery
head on a platter believe they have the so-called smoking gun in
the form of a videotape that shows him placing one hand on the
throat of an Indiana basketball player during a practice. Neil
Reed, whose allegations of physical abuse while he was an Indiana
player have triggered this latest Knight brouhaha, says the player
is him. It really doesn't matter. It's a player, and most people
are of the opinion that a coach who gets physical with a player is
crossing a very dangerous line.
</P>
<P>
   Knight is one of the great larger-than-life sports figures of
our time. People with very little knowledge about any other aspect
of college basketball have an acquaintanceship with the Bob Knight
persona. In their minds, Bob Knight is a connotation. It's a lot
like George Steinbrenner. Just as someone might be able to tell you
that this Steinbrenner fellow is an ogre who fires people with
regularity _ could any other comparable ownership figure be so
readily parodied, as Steinbrenner was on ``Seinfeld?'' _ so, too
might someone be able to tell you that there is this basketball
coach who had some kind of a run-in with the police in, where was
it, Puerto Rico, and didn't he throw a chair at someone once upon a
time? He may or may not be the best college coach of all time, but
he surely is the most infamous.
</P>
<P>
   He has manifested many behavioral improprieties that surely
would have brought down others, and he almost undoubtedly assumes
he will survive the latest crisis, but this time he may be wrong.
It is very possible that Knight will not coach another game at
Indiana. That would be sad. A man this talented should not go out
in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Knight is not an ogre. He is capable of great kindnesses and
charitable acts, and he can be a very charming companion. I can
bear personal witness to one act of extraordinary professional
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who have found in him things to admire, I
always have worried that his career might end in what loosely could
be termed a ``Woody Hayes'' incident. He has been unaccountable for
so long, dating back to his six years at West Point, and he is
quite incapable of conciliation. He does not welcome any challenge
to his authority. He is certainly not good at apology.
</P>
<P>
   He always makes sense to himself, if not to everyone else.
People assume it is the wins and losses that most matter, and it is
an article of faith among those who know him that he would like to
coach long enough to pass Dean Smith as the winningest coach in
college history. But winning is not everything to Knight. Playing
the game properly is his prime interest. No other coach has spent
more time lamenting his own team's poor winning performances or
praising a defeated foe's gallant losing efforts. He always
believed that a team in possession of some talent would, if it
played the game correctly, win its allotted share of games. What
offends him are thoughtless displays, whether by his own team or
the referees, whom he always has held to a high standard.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in how he manifests his anger. For a man who
successfully has instilled life-skill virtues in three generations
of players, he has very little self-control. He is a bully, and a
rather vulgar one at that. He has an ``Animal House'' sense of
humor. It's all under the guise of ``trying to make them better
players,'' and, by extension, better people, but times have changed
and Knight has not. The public doesn't tolerate boorishness the way
it used to, even in Indiana, where basketball is a religion. Once
upon a time, Knight could do anything he wanted and still be secure
in the knowledge that the people of Indiana loved him. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Star ran a poll a few weeks ago asking whether
Knight should remain as coach. A slight majority said no. We're
talking sea change here. A few years ago he would have had an 80
percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that the Hoosiers last won a national title in
1987 and last reached the Final Four in 1992? Well, sure. But the
reason people believe they haven't won big when it matters lately
is that Knight's ways don't work with modern kids. People grumble
about the new IU pattern in which the team annually gets off to a
fast start, only to deteriorate completely during the NCAA
tournament, worn out by the pressure of daily life with Knight.
Since he is incapable of change, they now believe he must go.
</P>
<P>
   Were Knight to plead for his job, citing his impressive
graduation rate and the fact that NCAA investigators don't even
know the route to Bloomington before even mentioning his three NCAA
titles, he'd be allowed to coach long enough to catch Smith and
Adolph Rupp combined. But we all know that Knight would never, ever
do that. He has done it his way, without the slightest
interference, for 34 years. They indulged him at West Point and
they have been indulging him at Indiana since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   If he quits now, it will be possible to save his reputation. He
has served the game of basketball honorably. He will be remembered
as the three-time national championship coach whose better teams
were joys to watch. He will be remembered as the ultra-successful
coach who never once had an NCAA investigator darken his door.
</P>
<P>
   But if he digs in, the end, whenever it does come, will be ugly.
He will be remembered as the cop-resisting, chair-throwing,
fan-stuffing, toilet paper-waving, throat-grabbing wildman who
lacked the personal discipline he demanded of others. If there is
any person on this earth to whom he listens, that person should
speak up now. He must be persuaded to retire with some degree of
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   In this other distasteful scenario, the perceived evil he
represents will live long after him, while the great amount of good
he has performed sadly will be interred with his bones.

AMERICAN WOMEN WILL FIND MUCH TO ADMIRE IN BRITISH CALENDAR  
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That hot calendar featuring the British club women wearing
little but pearls and pleasant smiles is to be in American stores
for Mother's Day. The calendar is obviously timed as the perfect
gift for the woman who has everything and wishes she had a little
less.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies of Rylstone (a 19-month calendar starting with June)
will likely be as much of a smash hit here as it's been in England,
where a group of village friends came up with a unique way to raise
money for leukemia research. Their bravado, along with their ripe
bodies, has made them overnight sensations.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a movie about them in the works.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the start of something big. And I mean that in the
most fleshy of terms. I've been corresponding with Christine Clancy
in Skipton, England, who is ``Miss September'' she holds a teapot
to her bosom in her photo _ and agrees women seem to ``rather
identify with us rather than 6-foot-tall willowy models.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her friends had a great time shooting the calendar with
lots of laughs and several glasses of wine. They gathered ``round
in dressing gowns'' and ``dropped the gown when the photographer (a
husband of one in the group) was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine was shyer than some about disrobing, but reminded
herself it was for charity and ``just took a deep breath and got on
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A display of unadorned, gravity-sensitive bodies is timely not
only for Mother's Day but for the approach of summer, a definite
low self-esteem season for many women. As we get into the tank-top
months the average female needs all the encouragement she can get
to put on a brave front. The sun teases us to strip down and run
free, and the ego says, ``Please don't, at least not until you do
something about those arms and thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies of Rylstone are past that. So is actress Kathleen
Turner, now appearing naked, at least for a minute or so, in her
celebrated role as Mrs. Robinson in the stage version of ``The
Graduate.'' One critic called her Junoesque, which is a lovely way
of saying that Ms. Turner is bigger than a breadbox.
</P>
<P>
   There are more proud moments to come. NOW has declared Sept. 20
Love Your Body Day, when it asks consumers to talk back to media
and advertisers who create unhealthy and self-destructive images
for women and girls. Consider who makes money on your feeling bad
about yourself, says NOW. I like that a feminist organization is
part of the battle, since some purists think it's beneath
independent women to worry about their looks. As if Madeleine
Albright doesn't have photo op angst.
</P>
<P>
   You can't live in this culture and not feel self-conscious about
being imperfect. My friend Sissy in Los Angeles is looking for a
place she can move to where it will feel OK to wear sleeveless
dresses in the summer and not worry about her arms.
</P>
<P>
   We need all the inspiration we can get. Ginger is a longtime San
Francisco Bay Area artist model in a short, chunky, generous body
whose girth and spirit are currently celebrated in a show at a
Santa Rosa gallery. Ginger wears not much more than a red glove in
some of her portraits and says women are always coming up to her
and thanking her for being so unabashed about her body.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger knows by flaunting her flesh she gives other women a
boost of confidence in their own. ``It's the least we women can do
for each other,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Right. Now pull up those spaghetti straps and get on with it.

BLACKJACK SOFTWARE MAY EVEN THE ODDS  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In casinos, the house has the advantage. If you don't believe
it, look around. They didn't build palaces like these by giving
away free drinks and big jackpots all the time, but by grinding
down players little by little.
</P>
<P>
   But at some games, the players have a slightly better advantage
of winning _ or not losing as much, if you're a gambling realist.
When bets are placed correctly, the house has only a slight edge at
the craps table. And blackjack tables offer a fairly level playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackjack 6-7-8'' is a program that seeks to help players make
that field even more level. The program, which costs about $60 and
is for Windows, is the outgrowth of Hal Marcus' 1971 visit to Las
Vegas. It was a trip to the bookstore _ rather than a blackjack
table _ that really started Marcus, a computer programmer, on his
way to eventually cofounding Stickysoft Corp. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On that trip, Marcus purchased Edward O. Thorp's ``Beat the
Dealer,'' a blackjack system developed by a mathematics professor
at the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Marcus learned that players could do better at the
blackjack tables if they would follow certain betting strategies _
some of which seemed to run against common sense. For instance,
Thorp's strategy is to double the bet when the player has an
ace-seven showing and the dealer has a three.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Marcus purchased his first personal computer, and four
years later wrote a blackjack program to test various strategies.
Although the program was graphically crude by today's standards, he
found people who played it were fascinated by it. He also found
that most of the people who played it made decisions based on
hunches.
</P>
<P>
   And thus ``Blackjack 6-7-8'' was born. It allows players to play
at a blackjack table just like in a casino. However, it can also be
told to provide hints during game play and teach players to make
the proper decisions that will give them an edge over the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one plays alone at a blackjack table, the computer will
supply up to six computer controlled players to play, using one to
25 decks, using rules that can be customized to fit any casino in
the world. The human player can also control the actions of some or
all of the other players at the table rather than let the computer
do the work.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure the program can really help improve your
blackjack game, put your theory to the test: Set up the computer
players to use various strategies, then run simulated hands _ up to
2 billion of them _ to find out how the systems worked.
</P>
<P>
   While users play their hands, the program tracks how many
decisions were made correctly and helps players find where they may
be able to beat the dealer by acting differently given the same set
of cards.
</P>
<P>
   A training section allows players to concentrate on specific
hands. There are no other players, and the hands aren't finished _
only the choices count. That way, players can train in an area of
weakness, go to the playing area, then track their decisions to see
if they've improved.
</P>
<P>
   The program teaches betting strategy as well as playing strategy
and can be set to alert the player if either of those strategies is
violated during play. For players who want to try counting cards,
the program can display a running count and true count as well as
the number of cards left in the shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Nice features, good graphics, simple play and sophisticated
teaching make this a top-notch piece of simulation software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackjack 6-7-8'' is available from StickySoft Corp. of
Buffalo Grove, Ill. For information, visit the company's Web site:

PUTIN WINS ANOTHER VICTORY IN PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Last week, President-elect Vladimir Putin pushed the
long overdue ratification of a major arms control treaty through a
compliant lower house of parliament. Wednesday he scored a victory
with Russia's regional bosses in the parliament's upper chamber,
easily winning a vote to get rid of a prosecutor who was the
scourge of former President Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, the upper house also approved the START II
nuclear arms pact, which passed the lower house last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid display of loyalty from the governors and local
leaders in the Federation Council, as the upper house is called,
was their 133-10 vote to dismiss Yuri Skuratov, the general
prosecutor whom Yeltsin tried twice to fire last year after he
began to investigate corruption in the Kremlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia now has a real, solid president and it needs a
full-blooded working prosecutor,'' said Anatoly Lisitsyn, governor
of the Yaroslavl region northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier votes on Skuratov, the upper house voted against
the Kremlin, displaying a rare rebellious streak that was a
reflection of Yeltsin's growing political weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three weeks after his election on March 26, Putin has
scored back-to-back parliamentary victories, proof that he has the
political strength to command a majority in both houses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what Putin plans to do with his mandate.
Both the ratification of START II and the dismissal of Skuratov are
leftovers from the Yeltsin agenda.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to dismiss Skuratov was made in February 1999,
shortly after he started working with prosecutors in Switzerland on
a corruption and kickback investigation that linked the Kremlin's
property management office and Mabatex, a Swiss-based firm that did
extensive business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation was used by Yeltsin's opponents to challenge
his authority in the upper house, which under the Russian
constitution must approve any changes in the office of the general
prosecutor, a position similar to that of the U.S. attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Backed into a corner, the Kremlin shifted the focus onto
Skuratov himself, with the broadcast on a state-run television
channel of a videotape showing the prosecutor in bed with two
prostitutes. Despite the humiliation and a subsequent investigation
into his own conduct, Skuratov continued to battle for his old job,
even after he was formally suspended.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Skuratov lost his fight and acknowledged that the
new political situation in Russia ``objectively requires my
departure.'' He said the future of his investigations would depend
on ``the position of the Federation Council and the president of
the country, and if the president does nothing, then all these
cases will disappear into the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin has done little to reveal his plans for Russia,
including how he wants to carry out what he called in his campaign
``a dictatorship of the law.'' In the three weeks since his
election he has continued to project the image of the resolute,
energetic leader, which was enhanced this week with a three-day
foreign tour that took him from Belarus to Britain and then on
Tuesday to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   His first major policy statement is expected soon after his May
7 inauguration, when he will address both houses of parliament with
a state of the nation speech. A more detailed program, now being
prepared by a privately funded think-tank headed by German O. Gref,
is expected to be issued later next month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the meantime, Putin seems to prefer to keep people guessing
about his plans and policies, from the redefinition of the
relationship between the central government and the regions to the
rearrangement of broadcasting licenses among competing media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in meetings with foreign businessmen, has repeatedly
stressed his commitment to the principles of a market economy. His
naming last week of Andrei Illarianov, a liberal economist, as his
chief economic adviser was seen as support for continued economic
reform in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economy, helped by high oil prices, has performed
better than expected a year ago, but Putin has reportedly called
for a tight budget for next year, to prepare for the possibility of
lower energy prices.

NETWORKS LOVE THE TRIED, THE TRUE, THE BLAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use on or after April 20, 2000) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, president of HBO's original programming, had two
potential projects before him: ``The Children,'' based on David
Halberstam's acclaimed account of the civil-rights movement, and
``The Corner,'' an unflinching look at the drug culture focusing on
an open-air drug market in West Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, says David Simon, co-author of ``The Corner,''
Albrecht went with his project, the critically lauded mini-series
airing Sundays through May 21. ``(Albrecht) thought, `Any network
could do ``The Children'' with some justice,''' Simon recounted.
``It's the kind of ennobling story that TV has always been adept
with. But nobody in their right mind except HBO could touch `The
Corner.' Chris was thinking not in terms of programming, but
counter-programming, what (BEGIN ITAL)shouldn't(END ITAL) be on
(network) TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, the networks are seeking to get in the
game of sophisticated, specialized entertainment, the kind that
involves and challenges audiences rather than give them something
to do while finishing the laundry or paying bills. Unfortunately,
each time they create cable- caliber shows, they reap cable-caliber
ratings. Which is to say, miniscule by network standards. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ABC introduced ``Wonderland,'' a dark but compelling drama about
an overloaded big-city mental-health care facility. Midway through
the pilot episode, a pregnant character took a syringe to her
swollen belly during a melee in an emergency room, and although she
recovered, the show never did: Nearly a quarter of the viewing
audience (BEGIN ITAL)immediately(END ITAL) switched channels. (On
HBO, viewers would scarcely have flinched.)
</P>
<P>
   On the next _ and last _ evening ``Wonderland'' aired, it
prompted a whopping 20 million viewers, sated with the narcotizing
effects of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and unwilling to
wallow in unpleasant reality, to switch off ABC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC made a valiant effort to sell viewers on its highly praised
series ``Freaks and Geeks,'' about high-school kids in '80s
Michigan waking up to the mysteries and miseries of life; network
executives called the show a personal favorite. But the show had a
couple of things working against it: First, the characters looked
like ordinary people, not Hollywood pin-ups playing teenagers
usually found on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the characters _ even minor, supporting roles _ were
multifaceted individuals facing a lot of deep, palpable anguish
beyond the ``I'm-not-popular-enough'' boo-hooing of teens over on
The WB. The show in general rewarded close attention more than
casual viewing. (In fact, it was originally conceived as an HBO
series.) It averaged about 7million to 8 million viewers, which
would thrill Fox, The WB or any cable outlet, but embarrassed NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the year to try this _ with the game-show mania,
the networks got addicted to huge ratings and it killed their
motivation to do a small show,'' says series creator Paul Feig.
``We had an 8 share, ABC had a 25 share. You do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Feig's series was frequently pre-empted _ by the World Series,
during the Christmas season, and so on _ and didn't have a chance
to build momentum; it returned once head-to-head against
``Millionaire.'' ``We heard from a lot of people who were attached
to it, and they wrote to tell us they would try to get friends to
watch it, but once they did, we were off the air again,'' Feig says
with a shrug. ``When we were on for four or five weeks straight, we
were always building. We got so much feedback; it was heartening to
know we affected people. I know there are people desperate for this
kind of show _ just not people with Neilsen boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also took a risk with the quirky animated comedy ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' about heavenly and hellish forces battling over
the soul of a common shlub. Asked before the series debuted whether
the show might not be more at home on a cable outlet than on NBC,
series creator Matthew Carlson replied, ``From the very start, they
got the show, they got what we were trying to do, and were
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so a handful of affiliates _ which saw the fact that the
series toyed playfully with spiritual conundrums as a sign of the
impending apocalypse _ yanked it from the air without even taking a
look to see how benign the program actually was; the fact that it
was scheduled opposite ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
practically ensured its subsequent cancellation within a month of
its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just don't get lucky,'' offers Carlson, as
philosophically soft-spoken as one of his characters. ``Our fate
was sealed when we were scheduled for 8:30 Tuesdays (opposite
``Millionaire''). The lead time on animation is so long that 18
months ago when we began working on this, Tuesdays didn't look so
bad. But by the time we came on, 'Millionaire' was on the
landscape. It's really tough against a show like that, there is a
relative success, and yet the number's really small and when you
look at it, it hurts. It's hard to get excited about those ratings.
In a time slot like that, it's hard to make an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson adds that he and NBC were ``blindsided'' by the
affiliate rebellion, less so the protests from people who typically
hadn't seen the show: ``I kept hearing the same (erroneous)
description of God _ 'beer-guzzling hippie.''' He points out that
despite its cancellation in America, the show continues to play
successfully in many foreign territories. ``We're encouraging
people to fly to Spain to watch it,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   None of these delicate series would have been jerked around in
such fashion on cable, where shows are given a time slot for a
predetermined amount of time _ from three months to as long as two
years _ without interruptions, which gives audiences time to find
and form firm opinions on them. And on cable, where there are fewer
original programs on the schedule, a show like ``God, the Devil and
Bob'' would be the high-profile crowned jewel in, say, Comedy
Central's schedule, not just another NBC show to be juggled around
indifferently.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' ``Freaks'' and ``Wonderland'' _ together, they sound
like a pretty cool amusement park _ in addition to ``Sports
Night,'' which didn't pull the audiences ABC sought and may next
season go to NBC or HBO, are currently mulling over offers from
other outlets interested in picking them up. (In May, The Museum of
Television and Radio will present the entire run of ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' including six episodes that never aired.) Whether they
will return elsewhere or not, of course, depends on if the
alternative outlets can pony up network-sized money _ which few,
outside of HBO, can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting is the fizzle that was ``Falcone,'' CBS's
highly publicized string of episodes about a undercover cop posing
as a mobster. It was, by and large, standard-issue TV fare _
interchangeably attractive performers, simplistic moral quandaries,
rote action, all executed, so to speak, with competence. But
``Falcone'' suffered in comparison to ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's
gangster sensation, to which it was invariably compared. If fans of
the genre had what felt like the real deal in terms of violence,
language and sexuality, this pretender was never going to become a
made man.
</P>
<P>
   Network television will always be able to create a handful of
quality shows and lovable characters, and it's wonderful at working
within the limitations of certain genres (see ``NYPD Blue'' or
``ER'' or ``Everybody Loves Raymond''). But given its increasingly
short attention span, it won't be able to create and coddle
inventive, refreshing shows and situations and characters that
absolutely get under a viewer's skin.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of their ``volume-volume-volume'' mindset, networks
will always be thinking in terms of appealing to a monolithic
audience, which to their minds, according to their reams of
demographic studies, is not terribly bright. On the other hand,
smart, passionate creators of programs like those above are out to
entertain like-minded individuals _ these folks don't talk down to
their friends, so why should they talk down to their audiences?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what separates the networks from cable (except HBO)
is money. Fewer established actors and writers work for cable, or
take big pay cuts to do so. Many of the shows are shot in Vancouver
or someplace where shows are cheaper to produce than in Los
Angeles. Animated series on cable _ think ``South Park'' or ``Dick
and Paula's Celebrity Special'' _ are intentionally cheesy; calling
them ``animated'' is almost being kind.
</P>
<P>
   Feig maintains ``Freaks'' would be hard-pressed retain its level
of quality with a lower budget. ``It would be tough _ we've gotten
rabid interest from cable, but they can't match our budget,'' Feig
says. ``I thought it was a generous budget, but we still went over
every week on show.'' With less money, Feig says, he'd have to
sacrifice some of the period music that peppers each episode or
move production outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggravating to say that $1 million is not enough,'' he
admits, adding that working with big money can threaten the
material with artistic compromises. ``With those higher budgets
comes higher scrutiny from the money people. If they say something
like, 'We won't pay the money if you don't cast a hot, chesty girl,
because that'll get ratings,' it's hard to say, 'No, you're
wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, too, initially insists that ``God'' is too big for
cable: ``Our budget was about $1 million per episode, and cable
can't do that.'' But, he admits, ``I'm in the broadcasting
business, where you want to seek out large audiences. The way I'm
programmed, you always try to do network first. But, once you fall
in love with your show, you think, 'Wow. I could do almost any
version.'''

SHE TOOK THE BULLET, BUT NOW SHE CALLS THE SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola mumbles. She slouches. She twists and twirls her
hair a lot. She can be painfully shy. She isn't much of a
storyteller and will take the visual over the verbal any day of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   These things become immediately apparent when you spend time
with the 28-year-old daughter of high-powered director Francis Ford
Coppola, a young woman who up until now has been most famous for
being a bad actress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sofia Coppola never wanted to be an actress in the first
place. When her father cast her as Michael Corleone's daughter in
``The Godfather, Part III,'' she gamely went along with the idea,
mostly because she was bored with school at the time. She never had
any illusions, though, about her talent in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even supposed to be in the movie,'' Coppola says
softly. ``I was in Rome on Christmas vacation, and they called and
asked me to come to the set. Winona Ryder had dropped out of the
production, and I had already read the part during a round table
reading. My father asked, and I said yes. I just kind of jumped
into it. I never thought about the hugeness of the movie or all the
hoopla surrounding it. When I was there, I was just trying to stay
afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   She hated almost every minute of it. ``The Godfather III'' was a
preordained disappointment (how do you follow the first two
chapters?), and Sofia received much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism was really intended for me,'' Francis Ford
Coppola says. ``Just like the end of the story, when the little
girl gets the bullet that was meant for her father.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl is now a grown woman, and after successful
career stints as a photographer and fashion designer, she believes
she has found the job she knew she wanted all along. Coppola has
directed her first film, ``The Virgin Suicides,'' a movie she
adapted herself from Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about five lustrous
sisters who commit suicide and the young boys who can't shake their
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola believes directing was something she always knew she
could do. But, ``When something's really close to you, you don't
see it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean she wasn't aware of the career possibilities.
There are those famous genes, of course, not that her father
encouraged her one way or the other. (``He wants you to follow your
own path,'' she says.) Coppola made quite a few home videos when
she was young, and took great pleasure in ``getting the other kids
to do what I wanted them to do.'' In fact, what soured her on
acting (besides all the bad reviews) was the inability to boss
people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in having someone dictate my choices to
me,'' she says. ``I like to be the one doing the dictating.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be the most placid dictator in history. Contrasting
with her famously animated father, Coppola prefers to be seen, not
heard. When directing a scene, she stands right by the camera, in
order, she says, to make the actors feel more relaxed. But it's
probably out of necessity, too; otherwise no one would ever hear
what the soft-spoken Coppola had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked with a director that quiet,'' says actress
Kirsten Dunst, who plays Lux Lisbon, the oldest ``Suicides''
sister. ``Sofia never raised her voice once. She was always so
calm, so collected and so open to other people's ideas. But
underneath that calmness, she was in total control. She always had
an answer and a reason for whatever was happening in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurance came from Coppola's total familiarity with the
material. Coppola read ``The Virgin Suicides'' four years ago and
immediately connected with the story, for reasons she's not able
(or willing) to articulate. After learning that someone had already
purchased the film rights to the book, Coppola decided to write a
screenplay anyway, figuring it would be a good exercise if nothing
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really protective about the book, and I had all these
ideas about how it should be done,'' Coppola says. ``So I'd write
on the weekends, and before I knew it, I was halfway through, and I
thought, 'Well, I should finish it.' When it was done, I had
pictured every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pictured it so well that when producer Julie Costanzo
passed her screenplay along to the company that owned the book,
they ditched their plans and offered Coppola the directing job.
Costanzo says it was the writing, not the family name, that got
Coppola hired, although Francis Ford Coppola did come on board as
one of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dunst, ``The Virgin Suicides'' stars James Woods
and Kathleen Turner, who played Coppola's mother in Francis Ford
Coppola's 1986 film ``Peggy Sue Got Married.'' Woods, playing
against type as a milquetoast father, ultimately became Coppola's
most outspoken and protective supporter, proclaiming, ``I hope this
movie is a success so that all the naysayers who slammed her when
she was a teen-ager because her father cast her in a movie will
finally get to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola smiles when told of Woods' comments, but if she's bitter
about anything in her past, she does a good job of hiding it. She
married director Spike Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') last summer
at her parents' estate in the Napa Valley. (Was it close to that
big wedding scene in ``The Godfather''? Coppola: ``Kind of,
yeah.'')
</P>
<P>
   She talks now of being a ``supportive wife'' for Jonze and
wanting to learn to be a ``homemaker.'' The couple lives in Los
Feliz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd really like to learn to do is cook,'' Coppola says.
</P>
<P>
   Might her father have some input in that area?
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's going to teach me how,'' she says. ``And that's a
pretty good thing because he's almost as good a cook as he is a
director.''!end! &QL;

<P>
   ``The Miracle Maker'' brings us the Life of Christ in the same
medium that transformed Gumby into a children's icon, Claymation,
mixed intermittently (and irritably) with inferior other styles
(probably farmed out to other animators in order to meet some
deadline or budgetary constraint).
</P>
<P>
   The cast of voices _ led by Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and
including Julie Christie (playing Mary Magdelene, who's not a
prostitute here, just a little crazy), William Hurt (who, even
though his mug's nowhere in sight, !ital!still!off manages to
overact), Ian Holm, Richard E. Grant and so on _ underscores the
intended level of reverence surrounding this project. And at times,
the tableaux created are visually impressive. Particularly the
crucifixion, but then, every filmmaker tends to do a good job with
the crucifixion; if you can't make that stirring, you don't belong
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the story is delivered with a reverence
bordering on bloodlessness; kids may enjoy the animation, but
there's nothing that fresh here that parents haven't sat through
countless times before. One imagines the brainstorming session:
``How !ital!hasn't the story of Jesus been told?'' Stay tuned for
next year's sock-puppet version; it really couldn't be any
kitschier than this.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fanny Kemble wrote a memoir about life in slave-era Georgia
that, when published in her native England, was credited with
convincing Parliament to withdraw loans to the Confederacy, which
in turn weakened the war effort in the clash between the North and
South. On the other hand, in ``Enslavement: The True Story of Fanny
Kemble,'' she spouts such balderdash as ``No one can paint me as I
am because I am not what I appear to be'' and ``I am sick to death
of being Fanny Kemble but I'm so good at it, I can't do anything
else'' _ in the film's first six minutes. So you're not really
inclined to think very well of her, regardless of the historical
record.
</P>
<P>
   And one suspects that Jane Seymour, who stars as Kemble and
serves as executive producer of ``Enslavement,'' really didn't have
anything powerful or persuasive or interesting to say about
slavery, she just wanted to be heroic while parading around in some
really elegant gowns. And so she does, after winning the heart of a
wealthy landowner named Pierce Butler (Keith Carradine), who tells
her, ``I would never attempt to restrict you;'' but of course,
after the requisite love scene, he's doing precisely that not five
minutes later in the film. The rest of the movie is just as subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' which aired on CBS
two months back, ``Enslavement'' can't decide whether it's a story
about race or just a standard-issue bodice-ripper; unlike
``Hemings,'' it's more at home as the latter. Director James Keach,
Seymour's husband, gives himself the role of a simpering yet heroic
doctor who chases Fanny; he also opens the movie with an
exploitative and otherwise unrelated scene straight out of
``Mandingo'' of semi-nude slaves brutalized for engaging in a
romantic coupling.
</P>
<P>
   He also bathes his wife in so much soft focus the whole movie
feels fuzzy. Though the film spans 20 years and Fanny was in her
50s during the Civil War, Seymour _ whose British accent sounds
like the result of watching an hour or two of ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' _ doesn't seem to age a day. Sitting through this,
however, will most definitely impress upon you the ravages of time.

 Cracking the Egg: How to make the most of the cook's most  popular,
versatile _ and controversial _ ingredient   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With Americans eating an average of 225 every
year, the egg is one of the most ubiquitous foods in the home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The egg endures as a workhorse in kitchens around the globe,
getting beaten, boiled and fried and conscripted into duty as a
leavening for cakes and thickener for sauces and custards.
</P>
<P>
   It's also one of nature's most ingenious foods. Wrapped inside
the smooth shell is complete protein as well as healthy doses of
vitamins A, B and D.
</P>
<P>
   The egg is tough, surviving nearly three decades of America's
cholesterol scare. But it is facing a new foe _ the politics
surrounding a relatively new strain of salmonella that could lead
to wholesale pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Food section, we discuss those issues and unscramble
some of the egg's mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the surprising results of a series of tests that
pitted the nation's first mass-marketed in-shell pasteurized eggs
against traditional eggs, along with clear guidelines on how to
safely cook with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Baking guru Flo Braker, kitchen maven Marion Cunningham and
Working Cook chef Tara Duggan offer recipes showing how to best use
the egg. In between we've packed in tips on handling and storage.
We even show you how to dye eggs and the very best way to hard-cook
them _ just in time for Passover, Easter and the other spring
rituals that celebrate the symbol of life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
When you crack your next egg, consider that beneath the shell lurks
a pool of politics that could eventually lead to the wholesale
pasteurization of the nation's egg supply.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stop the spread of a relatively new bacteria
called Salmonella enteritidis, or SE, the federal government is in
the process of writing a series of new egg laws.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the law, expected to be in place next year,
would force farmers who find any hint of SE in their farms to
destroy millions of eggs or send them to be pasteurized or
irradiated. The effort is an attempt to reduce the 230,000 cases of
SE poisoning that afflicts Americans every year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the technology is still far from perfect and compulsory
pasteurization laws have yet to be considered, one company has
already put in-shell pasteurized eggs on store shelves on the East
Coast. Those eggs should be in Northern California markets by late
fall, says John Davidson, president of the New Hampshire
egg-pasteurization company whose product bears his name and the
slogan, ``the safe egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Although another brand of in-shell pasteurized eggs is available
in limited markets in Minnesota, Davidson's brand is the first
aimed at nationwide distribution. The eggs should cost about 35
cents more per dozen than most conventional eggs, Davidson says.
</P>
<P>
   To pasteurize the eggs, Davidson's company uses a machine that
sends eggs through a series of warm water baths. That process raise
the egg's internal temperature to bacteria-killing levels but
leaves the egg in its liquid state. It changes the nature of the
egg in the same way that pasteurizing milk eliminated the cream
line and altered the flavor and nature of traditional raw milk.
</P>
<P>
   Egg producers don't think people will buy irradiated eggs, but
they do think safety-minded buyers will opt for a pasteurized one.
Although it is likely a long way off, Davidson and some consumer
groups and public health officials see a day when pasteurized eggs
will replace traditional eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not pasteurization becomes compulsory, pasteurized
eggs may be a good option for people who want to use recipes
calling for raw or undercooked eggs but want to avoid any possible
health risk.
</P>
<P>
   To find out just how well these pasteurized eggs perform, The
Chronicle's Food department put them through a series of
head-to-head tests with regular eggs. The results were surprising
and left us believers in the beauty and performance of the
unadulterated egg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Availability: &LR;  In-shell pasteurized eggs aren't available in
West Coast markets yet, so Davidson, who flew in from his New
Hampshire home to attend a recent hearing on the new federal egg
policy in Sacramento, hand-delivered three dozen of his freshest
pasteurized eggs. The same week, we received three dozen fresh eggs
from Petaluma Farms. Both sets were kept refrigerated from the time
we received them to the time of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Appearance: &LR;  Both sets were clean, white, extra large, grade
AA eggs. Because pasteurizing kills some of the protective
qualities of the egg's shell, Davidson's shells are coated with
food-grade wax. Davidson's package bears a USDA stamp certifying
the eggs meet federal standards for pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
   Once the eggs were cracked, we noticed significant differences.
The pasteurized whites were noticeably cloudy. The yolks were pale
but slightly plumper than the regular yolks _ a result of the
pasteurization process, Davidson says. Because the white-to-yolk
ratio is different in his eggs, an extra egg white might need to be
added to some recipes. When beaten, the pasteurized eggs appeared
more watery. The regular eggs were more viscous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Beating the whites: &LR;  We whipped two whites from each type of
egg, using the highest speed on a KitchenAid mixer until they
formed stiff peaks.
</P>
<P>
   When whipped, the volume achieved from each batch was about the
same, two cups. The big difference, however, was in whipping time.
Traditional eggs reached stiff peaks in three minutes; it took nine
minutes for the pasteurized whites to reach that stage _ which
actually put a strain on the mixer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Hard-cooked eggs: &LR;  We brought the eggs to a boil and cooked
them for eight minutes, then cooled and peeled them. Both types of
eggs had firm whites. But the traditional egg yolk was creamier and
had more flavor; The pasteurized egg was bland. Some tasters
detected a slight metallic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Scrambled eggs: &LR;  Each type of egg was beaten with 11/2
teaspoons of half-and-half, a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper,
then cooked in butter over medium-high heat.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional egg blended easily with the cream. The
pasteurized egg did not blend well and appeared watery. When
cooked, the traditional egg had a deeper yellow color, a softer
texture and tasted better. The pasteurized egg was pale, bland and
rubbery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Chocolate cake: &LR;  We baked two flourless chocolate cakes using
a recipe that required beating the eggs with sugar before folding
them into the batter. Both types of eggs were beaten for the same
amount of time and were the only leavening agent.
</P>
<P>
   The cakes were markedly different.
</P>
<P>
   The one made with traditional eggs rose slightly higher than the
one made with pasteurized eggs. But what really struck us was the
difference in texture. The pasteurized egg cake was firm and
compact, with a slightly hardened crust. The cake made with
traditional eggs had an even crumb and a spongy texture that
bounced back slightly when touched. The pasteurized egg cake had a
slight chemical taste; the traditional egg cake had a cleaner
chocolate flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Pot de creme: &LR;  Only the yolks are used in this baked custard
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of both custards was the same, but the pot de cr &LR; e &LR; me
made with traditional eggs had a soft, silky texture and a more
pronounced egg flavor. The pasteurized egg custard was lighter in
color, with a firmer texture and slightly dull flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Chronicle Food interns Noel Advincula and Margarita Camacho
and &LR;   &LR; Chronicle staff writer Tara Duggan performed the tests. The &LR; 
 &LR; Chronicle Food staff rated the results. &LR;

 LEARNING TO COOK: Easter Brunch Is a Snap With Featherbed Eggs  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Easter held great charm for me when I was a child,
and it still does. I'm no longer hunting for those hidden Easter
eggs that were so exciting to find when I was 5 or 6 years old.
This was in the late '20s when everyone in our neighborhood watched
their pennies, literally.
<P>
   Our Easter eggs were pink, colored in beet juice, and
pink-colored eggs (shells removed) often would be the centerpiece,
piled on a bed of lettuces, for the Easter dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Baked ham, candied pineapple, yams, frozen peas and cake were
the ritual Easter dinner. When my Italian grandmother and mother
bought their first bag of frozen peas, they cooked them and
absolutely loved them. My grandmother exclaimed, ``I'll never have
to shell another pea,'' and my mother said, ``Frozen peas are
greener than God made them.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like to celebrate Easter around your own table, invite
your family and friends to share a late brunch. Featherbed Eggs,
slices of ham and a bowl of fresh sliced fruit makes a very simple,
but pleasing Easter celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Featherbed Eggs must be made the night before you plan to bake
and serve them, so you have no last minute preparations. Cut up the
fruit early and serve cold slices of ham, or warm the slices while
finishing the Featherbed Eggs in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FEATHERBED EGGS
</P>
<P>
   You can double or triple this recipe if you have more than four
sharing Easter brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 slices white bread
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups grated sharp cheddar, Gouda, provolone or Monterey
Jack cheese, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Butter the sides and bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.
Arrange the slices of bread in the dish, trimming the edges, if
necessary. Sprinkle the bread with a little salt and pepper.
Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the bread.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the milk and eggs in a bowl and briskly stir until the
mixture is all one color and completey blended. Pour the milk
mixture over the bread and cheese. Cover and refrigerate for at
least 6 hours, or overnight.
</P>

 BEST WAY: Hard-Cooking Eggs   By Noel Advincula  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When hard-cooking eggs, overcooking is one of the
most common mistakes. The result can be rubbery egg whites, chalky
yolks, or an undesirable dark greenish sulfur-smelling halo
surrounding the yolk.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no way to see inside an egg and a thermometer certainly
can't be inserted to test for doneness. Therefore, cooks must use
precise boiling procedures and cooking times to come up with tender
egg whites and moist, golden yolks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried three methods for hard-cooking eggs. First, we immersed
a single layer of eggs in a medium saucepan in enough cold water to
cover the eggs by an inch. The eggs were brought to a rolling boil
and cooked for eight minutes. For the second trial, we used a
slotted spoon to carefully place the eggs in a saucepan of boiling
water using the same amount of water as in the first test. The
water temperature lowered when the eggs were put in, but then
returned to a rolling boil. We cooked the eggs for 12 minutes after
they were put into the water.
</P>
<P>
   In the third method, we immersed the eggs in cold water and
brought the saucepan to a boil. We covered the saucepan and removed
it from the heat, set it aside and allowed the eggs to cook by
residual heat for 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the first and second methods produced good results; the egg
whites were tender and the yolks were creamy and moist with no
green tinge. The results were similar for the third test _ evenly
cooked, creamy yolks and perfectly tender egg whites. Because the
first test took only eight minutes and yielded good results, we
concluded that it is the best way to cook the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we tested different methods to crack and peel eggs. We
first tried submerging the eggs in icy cold water for one minute
after removing them from the saucepan. They were then taken out of
the water, cracked, peeled and returned to the water.
</P>
<P>
   The second batch of eggs was transferred to a bowl and left to
cool in the refrigerator for five minutes, then cracked and peeled.
For the third test, we took the pot off the heat and left the eggs
immersed in the cooking water for another 20 minutes, then cracked
and peeled them.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, another batch of eggs was transferred to a colander
immediately after cooking and cracked and peeled under cold running
water.
</P>
<P>
   All of the eggs peeled easily. The only difference was that the
last test took the least amount of time. If you plan on storing the
eggs, transferring them directly to the refrigerator has the same
cooling effect as running them under cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we tested freshly purchased eggs against week-old eggs
and cooked both batches the same way. The fresh eggs were harder to
peel under cold running water because the air pocket under the
shell is smaller than in older eggs. But this was resolved by using
a pin to prick a hole at the wider end of the egg before boiling.
The overall appearance and taste was the same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hard-cook eggs by immersing placing them in a single layer in a
medium saucepan and adding enough cold water to cover by 1 inch.
Bring the water to a rolling boil and cook the eggs for eight
minutes. Remove them from the heat. Drain and rinse the eggs. Crack
and peel them under cold running water.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to use eggs that are a few days to a week old to
ensure easy peeling.

 THE WORKING COOK: Versatile and Nutritious, the Egg Is Perfect 
 Any Time   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When I think I don't have anything at home to
cook, I usually can find at least a few eggs. Excavating further
into the dark corners of the fridge for a half-empty can of beans,
crusty tortillas and a green-around-the-edges hunk of cheese, I
soon discover that a slap-dash version of huevos rancheros can be
one of the best things going.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides their general convenience, eggs are a very quick source
of protein. And they don't always have to be a part of a greasy,
potato-laden brunch concoction (not that I'm against that kind of
thing).
</P>
<P>
   For example, this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, Japanese Egg Drop
Soup, is a light vegetarian dish with the nurturing flavors of
ginger and honey. Though most Japanese egg drop soup recipes call
for dashi, a stock flavored with dried fish and seaweed, I chose to
use miso because it is more readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the medium-firm tofu in this recipe is a little wobbly
when you try to cut it, but it has a lovely texture next to the
delicate swirls of egg.
</P>
<P>
   In the Spaghetti alla Carbonara With Spring Peas, egg yolks form
the base of a thin sauce. A bit of shaved Parmesan, pecorino and
pancetta complement the fresh egg flavor, and fresh peas add
sweetness and a dash of green. For a dish this simple, freshly
ground pepper is a must.
</P>
<P>
   In the Now &AMP; Later recipe, a quiche with leeks and potatoes and
creme fraiche helps to create a luscious, thick custard. However,
there isn't too much cheese, so the richness isn't overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe makes three pies, so you can easily stash a couple in
the freezer. Then you don't have to worry when, heaven forbid, you
don't even have eggs in the house.

   JAPANESE EGG DROP SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   6 cups white miso soup, prepared according to package
instructions (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1-inch piece ginger
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces medium-firm tofu
</P>
<P>
   2 handfuls washed baby spinach leaves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Lightly beat the eggs in a small bowl; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the miso and the honey in a medium saucepan and bring to
a simmer. Peel the ginger and place it in a garlic press. Squeeze
out the ginger juice into the broth.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the tofu into small cubes.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to serve the soup, bring the stock to a boil
and add the spinach to wilt. Add the tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Return the stock to a boil, then remove from heat. Using a
chopstick, gently stir the stock in a circular motion in one
direction. Add the egg in a thin stream and stir in the other
direction to create egg swirls.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; To make the miso soup, I recommend using Westbrae
Natural's Mellow White Miso, a soup base of fermented soybean
paste, which you can find in the refrigerated ``natural foods''

 WINE POTPOURRI: Will Americans Shun Cabernet and Learn to Love 
 Syrah?   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Will Syrah overtake Cabernet Sauvignon as the red
wine Americans love to drink? That's one of the many intriguing
questions being asked by California winemakers as they try to keep
up with the changing tastes of American wine consumers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syrah is a tidy red wine wrapped up in a neat package, making it
easy to like. The bright raspberry-black cherry aromas and flavors
appeal more than those of Cabernet Sauvignon. Also, Syrah's balance
and structure attract red-wine fans the way few Merlots can. And
Syrah has the same silky texture that fans of Pinot Noir love. Only
Zinfandel seems to offer the same attractive components as Syrah.
</P>
<P>
   The ancestral home of Syrah is the Rhone Valley of France,
although some theories hold that the grape was first grown in
Shiraz, Persia, known today as Iran. Other grape detectives now
claim that Syrah is native to the Rhone Valley and has a lot in
common with an obscure Rhone grape called Mondeuse. Syrah shows its
stuff best in Hermitage, Cote Rotie and St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the popularity of Syrah has been on the rise in
Southern France, especially the Languedoc region, where the wine
offers the same bright berry flavors, but lacks the concentration
and depth of a Northern Rhone Syrah.
</P>
<P>
   Shiraz is the name for Syrah in Australia and South Africa. In
the vineyard, Syrah and Shiraz are the same, but a Rhone or
California Syrah tastes different than an Australian Shiraz. Syrahs
are known more for their spice and black pepper, while Shiraz is
fruitier with notes of berries and plums, and hints of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Oak is another component that separates Syrah and Shiraz. French
Syrah, especially from the Northern Rhone, is aged exclusively in
French oak, while most Australian Shiraz is aged in American oak.
The belief among many winemakers is that French oak, with its
spiciness, is good with Syrah, but the vanilla-coconut of American
oak is a better match with Shiraz. Australia's premier Shiraz,
Penfolds Grange, has been aged in American oak since the first
vintage in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   California Syrah is being grown in many parts of the state, but
among those regions with the most promise are Monterey County, Napa
Valley, Mendocino and some parts of Santa Barbara County.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Syrah vs. Sirah &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before Syrah became popular, an early favorite of California
winemakers was Petite Sirah. Rough, rustic and alcoholic in the
early years, Petite Sirahs are now more refined and drinkable at an
early stage.
</P>
<P>
   Identified in the 1970s as Durif, a nearly extinct French grape,
Petite Sirah popped back into the wine news in the late 1990s, when
DNA fingerprinting suggested that what is called Petite Sirah in
California has been applied to Durif, Syrah and an obscure French
grape called Peloursin. Further confusion comes with winemakers in
the Northern Rhone distinguishing between a small-berry Syrah grape
they call Petite Syrah and the larger-berried Grosse Syrah.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, you should taste the differences among Rhone Syrah,
Australian Shiraz and California Syrah and decide for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merry-Go-Round &LR;
</P>
<P>
   David Schlottman, a winemaker with Beringer Wine Estates for 25
years, has been appointed Senior Winemaker at St. Clement, a member
of Beringer Wine Estates. Schlottman established his reputation as
winemaker for Napa Ridge, a value line of wines, formerly a part of
Beringer Wine Estates. Bill Ballentine continues at St. Clement as
winemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Pezzi King, one of the rising stars in Sonoma County, has
appointed Cecile Lemerle, a French-trained winemaker born in
Champagne, as Director of Winemaking. Lemerle's previous position
was Director of Production for Opus One in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ricardo Sander of Los Angeles was disappointed that Truchard
Vineyards was not mentioned in a recent Potpourri article on
Carneros Pinot Noir.
</P>
<P>
   The omission of Truchard certainly was not intentional . . .
their wines, especially Pinot Noir, Merlot and Syrah, are among my
favorites. But then, it's not possible to list or mention all of
the wineries that make good wine from Carneros grapes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Brandy and other spirits are made using two kinds of stills. The
most efficient method is called a continuous still, where a liquid
fermented from grains or other materials is fed continuously into
the still and the spirit drawn off at a determined point.
</P>
<P>
   The other method, used to produce most of the world's great
brandies, like Cognac and Armagnac, is called an alembic (also
alambic), or pot still. The word is derived from the Arabic
 &LR; al-anbig &LR;  for a still. It is less efficient than a continuous
still because each batch must be heated separately and the still
must be emptied and reloaded each time. However, the advantage of
pot still distillation is a spirit with deeper, more complex
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ATF Hearings &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The California Wine Institute would like to alert concerned
consumers that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF)
will hold public hearings in five locations across the country,
including San Francisco, to determine the impact of wine label
statements currently in use.
</P>
<P>
   Of concern is whether the ``negative consequences of alcohol
consumption or abuse'' disqualify wine, beer and spirits from
carrying any health-related statements.
</P>
<P>
   ATF wants to know if the so-called directional wine label
statements refer consumers to the Federal Government's ``Dietary
Guidelines for Americans'' to learn the health effects of wine
consumption, or to their family doctors for such information.
</P>
<P>
   Comments on the wine label issue should be submitted to ATF by
letter, fax or e-mail. Written comments will be accepted by ATF
until September 29, 2000, and should be addressed to: Chief,
Regulations Division, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, P.O.
Box 50221, Washington, DC 20091-0221; Attn: Notice 892; or fax
(202) 927-8602; or e-mail  &LR; nprm &LR; atfhq.atf.treas.gov &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A public hearing on the wine label issue will be held May 23-25
at the Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport, 150 Anza Blvd.,
Burlingame. Other public hearing locations, from April to August,
include Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. For more
information, call Nancy Kern or Jim Ficaretta at ATF in Washington,
(202) 927-8210.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Liven Up Your Easter Brunch   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Bradley Ogden has come to the rescue for those who
want something different for Easter brunch with his Potato Skins
with Smoked Salmon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ogden is known for his brunch and breakfast dishes served at the
Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur. Housed in a charming Victorian, the
restaurant overlooks the proverbial babbling brook, and the outdoor
patio is ideal for weekend brunches.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can get more traditional brunch dishes at Lark
Creek, but one of my favorites is the potato skins. While a similar
dish with caviar has been popular in years past as an elegant
appetizer, it was Ogden who thought of adapting it to breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Many people love lox and bagels as a morning
repast. Of course, crisp fried potatoes are a natural morning
option, so putting them together makes perfect sense. For this
dish, the combination of roasted potatoes, salmon and lemony cream
is unbeatable. It truly is a great brunch dish, but it's also just
as good as a snack, appetizer or a passed hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   The red onion relish, made with lemon, chives and chervil, is
designed to be sprinkled around the plate, but you can sprinkle it
on top of the smoked salmon to replace the caviar, if you like.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: One Egg Stands White and Yolk Above the Rest   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Even though they're in just about every
refrigerator in America, deciding which eggs to buy can be
overwhelming. There are store brands, cage-free, vegetarian-fed and
vitamin-fortified, not to mention variation in size and color.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eggs also vary distinctly in price. One dozen large grade AA
white eggs can cost from $1.39-$3.59.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel of culinary professionals tasted 12 brands of
large white grade AA eggs, all available at local supermarkets. The
eggs were hard-cooked using the Best Way technique (see BESTWAY
EGG), and served at cool room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were all basically the same kind of egg and
were cooked the same, the panel noticed big differences in
appearance and flavor. Some eggs had a larger proportion of yolk to
white; others had very pale yolks in comparison to other brands.
Flavors also varied from bland to sulfurous.
</P>
<P>
   According to the panel, one brand stood out far above the rest.
Most of the others scored roughly the same, between 55 and 65
points.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's overwhelming favorite egg was  &UR; Andronico's &LR;  (1
dozen, $2.09 at Andronico's).
</P>
<P>
   Andronico's buys its eggs from Thayer Food Products, an
Oakland-based company with farms in the Central Valley. According
to Jill Benson of Thayer, the eggs are pretty generic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no special tricks to producing our eggs,'' says
Benson. The eggs are laid by white leghorn hens, which produce the
majority of white eggs. They're kept in cages and fed a natural
diet of corn, wheat and soybeans but may also be fed fish meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Andronico's egg is moderately priced, as well. ``Niche eggs
cost more to produce,'' Benson explains, referring to cage-free or
vegetarian-fed eggs. ``Even brown eggs are expensive because the
hens that lay them are larger and eat more.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel particularly liked the flavor of the Andronico's egg,
describing it as ``classic.'' One panelist noted the beautiful
yellow color; another liked the large yolk. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Cal &LR;  (eight-pack, $1.49 at Andronico's).
Three panelists commented on the soft texture of the yolks. Two
described the flavor as classic, but another detected a sulfurous
aftertaste. Two would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trader Joe's Cage Free &LR;  (1 dozen, $1.69 at Trader Joe's) came
in third. One described the flavor as ``very clean and delicate;''
another thought the overall texture and flavor were good. But
others thought the yolk was too light in color and the white was
tough. Two would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Veg-A-Pro &LR;  (1 dozen, $1.99 at Rainbow
Grocers), which is laid by hens ``fed a strict vegetarian diet,''
according to the package. Three panelists thought it was
flavorless, but others described it as creamy, tender and good
tasting. Two would buy it, one might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clover Stornetta &LR;  (1 dozen, $1.30 at Whole Foods) came in
fifth. One panelist thought the flavor and texture were good, but
others described the flavor as off and slightly sulfurous. One
panelist thought the egg was particularly rubbery. Two would buy
it, one might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth place went to  &UR; Eggland's Best &LR;  (1 dozen, $2.69-$2.99 at
many markets). One taster said it was very white, while another
called the white tough and rubbery. One would buy it, one might buy
it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Santa Rosa Egg Farms, Cotati, Cage Free,
Mollie Stone's and Veg-A-Fed and Gold Circle Farms, but they scored
too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Flo Braker, cookbook author and Chronicle
columnist; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 Guidelines for Buying and Using Eggs Safely
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eating a Caesar salad with raw eggs in the dressing is a
personal choice. Before you make it, consider that unpasteurized
eggs may contain a strain of salmonella bacteria that can make you
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors to weigh are the odds of infection. On
average, Americans eat 225 eggs a year. The United States
Department of Agriculture estimates that only one in every 20,000
eggs is infected with salmonella enteritidis, a strain of bacteria
easily killed if eggs are thoroughly cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella-related illness often produces symptoms much like the
flu: loose bowels, aches and fever. Healthy adults usually recover
within four days to a week. But the infection can be more severe,
and even fatal, among people with compromised immune systems, the
elderly and very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you want to eat raw eggs in salad dressing, meringues,
sauces and other recipes is a personal choice. But public health
experts say you can avoid illness from eggs by knowing how to buy,
handle and cook them safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer need not live in fear of eggs but certainly needs
to handle eggs with respect,'' advises Linda Harris, a food
microbiologist at the University of California at Davis. ``For
healthy individuals who can't live without their Caesar salad, it's
a risk worth considering. But I wouldn't make that salad for your
grandmother or child.''
</P>
<P>
   The following are a set of government-approved guidelines for
safe egg handling:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Buy Safe. &LR;  Purchase eggs only if sold from a refrigerator or
refrigerated case. Open the carton and make sure the eggs are clean
and the shells are not cracked. Refrigerate as soon as possible.
Store eggs in their original carton in the coldest part of the
refrigerator. Use them within four to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Keep Clean.  &LR; Wash hands, utensils, equipment and work areas
with hot, soapy water before and after they come in contact with
eggs and egg-containing foods. If a piece of shell falls into the
egg while cracking, remove it with a clean utensil.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Cook Thoroughly. &LR;  Cook eggs until both the yolk and the white
are firm, usually at 145 degrees. Scrambled eggs should not be
runny. Casseroles and other dishes containing eggs should be cooked
to 160 degrees. Avoid recipes that call for eggs that are raw or
undercooked when the dish is served. Serve dishes containing eggs
immediately. On a buffet, hot egg dishes should be kept hot, and
cold egg dishes kept cold. Egg dishes such as quiches may be
refrigerated for serving later but should be thoroughly reheated to
165 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Keep It Cold. &LR;  Use hard-cooked eggs (in the shell or peeled)
within one week after cooking. Cooked eggs should not be held at
room temperature for more than two hours. Eggs should not be frozen
in their shells. Refrigerate leftover cooked egg dishes for up to
three or four days. When refrigerating a large amount of a hot
egg-containing leftover, divide it into several shallow containers
so it will cool quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Be Safe Away From Home. &LR;  Cooked eggs for a picnic should be
packed in an insulated cooler with enough ice or frozen gel packs
to keep them cold. Carry it in the passenger compartment of the
car, not the trunk. If taking cooked eggs to work or school, pack
them with a small frozen gel pack or a frozen juice box.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Avoid Hidden Risks. &LR;  Foods containing raw or lightly cooked
eggs, such as Caesar salad, homemade ice cream or eggnog,
mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce, and French toast can be dangerous,
especially for young children, the elderly and individuals with
weakened immune systems. Replace them with cooked versions or forgo
the recipe altogether.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; EGGCETERA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Timing is everything.  &LR; A hen requires 24 to 26 hours to
produce an egg. Thirty minutes later, she starts all over again.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Porcelain.  &LR; An egg shell may have as many as 17,000 tiny
pores over its surface.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The chicken state.  &LR; About 240 million laying hens produce
approximately 5.5 billion dozen eggs per year in the United States.
An estimated 25 million of those hens are in California.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Shell game.  &LR; White-shelled eggs are produced by hens with
white feathers and ear lobes. Brown-shelled eggs are produced by
hens with red feathers and red ear lobes.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Spinning game.  &LR; To tell if an egg is raw or hard-cooked, spin
it. If the egg spins easily, it's hard-cooked. If it wobbles, it's
raw.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sign of spring.  &LR; During the spring (vernal) equinox, around
March 21, some people swear that an egg will stand on its small
end. Although some people have documented success, it is not known
whether such results were due to the equinox or to the
peculiarities of the particular egg.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Color it yellow.  &LR; Yolk color depends on the diet of the hen.
Natural yellow-orange substances such as marigold petals may be
added to light-colored feeds to enhance the yolk's hue.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Into the pan.  &LR; Howard Helmer secured the Guinness World
Record for omelet- making in 1990 by making 427 omelets in 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Eating large.  &LR; Californian Rick Royal created the world's
largest cr &LR; e &LR; me brulee in 1999. It weighed on at 1,000 pounds and
was 23 feet in diameter.

 Pending Pasteurization Policy Could Alter Eggs Forever  &HT;       
 By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;  The egg, long considered a near-perfect food
delivered in one of nature's most ingenious packages, is under
siege again.
<P>
   This time, the culprit isn't cholesterol, but Salmonella
enteritidis, a relatively new strain of the bacteria that first
showed up in eggs on the East Coast during the 1980s and has made
hundreds of thousands of people sick.
</P>
<P>
   In December, President Clinton proposed an emergency egg plan to
eradicate the bacteria. The plan could lead to wholesale
pasteurization or irradiation of the nation's egg supply _ a change
as radical as the campaign to pasteurize milk 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort, the government plans to teach America to
rethink how it cooks the 68 billion eggs eaten annually. That means
no more eggs over easy, and changes in recipes for everything from
ice cream and meringue to hollandaise sauce and Caesar salads.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the president's egg policy say the government is
caught up in a shell game that pits egg farmers against consumer
activists. The fight against SE is about five years too late, they
say. The rate of illness from Salmonella enteritidis has already
dropped, and is continuing to do so. Rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   At a federal hearing in Sacramento earlier this month,
government officials said that from 1996 to 1998, the number of
SE-related illnesses cases fell by 44 percent, to about 230,000 a
year. Since the outbreaks began in 1985, 79 deaths have been
attributed to SE.
</P>
<P>
   By its own estimates, the government believes only one in 20,000
eggs contains SE, which can be killed simply by cooking eggs so
they are no longer runny. Opponents like to point out that at a
rate of five deaths a year, fewer people die from eating SE-tainted
eggs than from lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Ernst, a poultry specialist in the animal sciences
department of University of California at Davis, said: ``If you
drive to the store to get eggs, you're taking a much greater risk
than eating those eggs raw. So how much time do you want to spend
worrying about eggs?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's policy and the rush to pasteurize eggs are
really about the politics of food safety, said Hans Reimann, a
recently retired U.C. Davis professor and one of the nation's top
authorities on egg-related safety and epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here is sort of a media scare, and regulatory
agencies feel compelled to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Poultry researchers and farmers say the government is mounting a
major attack on SE because it is a manageable battle that can be
won _ despite questions about the actual threat of SE. ``The
president said he was going to do it, so it will be done,'' Ernst
said.
</P>
<P>
   But to Laurie Girand, a Saratoga food activist whose daughter
fell ill in 1996 when she drank unpasteurized Odwalla juice
infected with E coli, arguments like that are industry
double-speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of this as a power struggle between business wanting
to go on as usual and the consumers saying you can't make us sick
anymore,'' said Girand, who is part of a panel advising the
government on its new egg law. ``The truth of the matter is they're
bringing biohazards into the home in the form of an egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to Petaluma Farms eggman Steve Mahrt.
He said he already goes to great lengths to keep his flock free
from SE. And if he is forced to pasteurize all of his eggs in the
shell, he'll be out of business. In-shell pasteurizing machines
just coming on the market cost as much as $1.5 million, a price he
can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they require pasteurization,'' he said, ``it would be the
end of family egg farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahrt and others say the real issue is a society that
increasingly demands the impossible: 100 percent risk-free food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can cook it all to 170 degrees and not touch it and
everything will taste like an old TV dinner,'' he said. ``The point
is getting up in the morning is hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's egg plan calls for reducing the estimated 230,000
cases of SE poisoning by half by the year 2005 and eliminate them
entirely by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal, the Department of Agriculture, the Food and
Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Controlplan to test
egg farms for the bacteria. If it's found in chickens or even just
in their hen houses, millions of eggs would either be destroyed or
sent for mass pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
   That's an expensive propositions that involves either breaking
the eggs and pasteurizing them as a liquid for large-scale food
service use or using a new and largely unproven technology that
would pasteurize them in the shell.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, all egg cartons will soon bear cigarette-style
warning labels that read, in part, ``Eggs may contain harmful
bacteria known to cause serious illness.'' And consumers are
already being advised to cook all eggs until firm.
</P>
<P>
   If these efforts don't reduce illnesses caused by SE-tainted
eggs, the day may come when every egg in America is either
irradiated, pasteurized or produced by a vaccinated chicken. It
would mark a wholesale change, reminiscent of when pasteurizing
milk became the law of the land early last century. The process
eliminated the cream line and changed the taste of whole milk.
</P>
<P>
   But eggs and milk are quite different. The shell is a safe
protective package, those opposed to mass pasteurization say, and
existing technology to pasteurize eggs changes their nature. Tests
in The Chronicle's test kitchen substantiated those claims and
showed the pasteurized eggs did not perform as well as traditional
eggs. (See story slugged EGG-MAIN)
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can say why the rates of SE-related infections
are dropping, Emilio Esteban, CDC assistant director for public
health, credits two things.
</P>
<P>
   One is that almost all egg farmers and packers have started
voluntary programs to improve egg handling practices. Second,
health departments orchestrated a public education campaign aimed
at teaching restaurant workers and home cooks how to handle eggs
properly to avoid undercooking or contaminating other food with
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   SE is a relative newcomer in the world of food-borne pathogens,
showing up inside eggs in the Northeast in the early 1980s, then
spreading to California _ particularly Southern California _ in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other estimated 2,000 strains of salmonella, some of
which live on the shells of eggs and are controlled through egg
washing, SE has a peculiar trait: It lives inside, rather than
outside, the egg shell.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why it cropped up or can make sense of its
infection patterns. In general, deaths attributed to SE are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, when the SE epidemic began, 79 deaths have been
linked to it _ 17 in California. Most cases have been among the
elderly or immune-compromised people in nursing homes or hospitals
who are more susceptible to the effects of salmonella. By way of
comparison, the Clinton administration estimates that about 9,000
deaths a year are attributed to all types of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with all the estimates is that the numbers get
softer the harder one looks. In fact, no one is sure how many
people get sick from SE, in large part because many cases aren't
severe enough to get counted.
</P>
<P>
   Most healthy adults who eat a tainted egg probably won't get
sick. If they do, they probably will experience a case of diarrhea
or other flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The president's egg plan still has a few more miles to travel
before it becomes law. Based on information gathered at the public
hearings and sent to the USDA, the rules will be polished, cost
estimates will be finalized and a draft will be issued by the end
of the year. Final rules should be in place by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the government effort to educate cooks about
handling eggs will continue, and state and federal health officials
hope the SE rates will keep declining.
</P>
<P>
   But until either all eggs are pasteurized _ the nation's first
mass-market brand is due to hit Northern California groceries later
this year _ or farmers figure out how to keep SE out of their
product, consumers will have to decide just how much of a risk
undercooked eggs are.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Girand says the solution is to fix the egg and farm
practices, not just to educate the consumer or rely on people who
cook food at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, egg farmers say the new regulations will
unfairly burden smaller producers. The basic science behind the new
policy is unsound, they argue. And the bottom line is that the egg
itself is a safe, wholesome part of America's diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect food in its own excellent natural container,''
said Mahrt, the Petaluma egg farmer. ``Everybody's shooting at it
but it survived the cholesterol scare _ and it can survive this.''

RENO SAYS U.S. MAY USE FORCE TO REUNITE ELIAN AND FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story will be updated as needed) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that the U.S.
government might have to use force to take Elian Gonzalez from his
Miami relatives in order to reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may come a time when there is no other alternative,''
Reno said at a Washington news conference Wednesday morning. ``But
we've got to do it in a careful, thoughtful way. No child should be
in that kind of never-never land for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the government would not take action until three
federal court judges in Atlanta ruled on a Justice Department
request that the court drop a temporary stay order that prevents
Elian from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must take enforcement based on the facts, as they arise at
the time,'' Reno said. ``Pressure should not be the issue. What is
right should be the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary stay was issued last Thursday by Judge J.L.
Edmondson of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and
remains in effect until the three-judge panel makes a ruling on it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the judges have been reviewing copies of the
briefs, and a ruling is expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's comments Wednesday come during a week that holds
religious significance for many Cuban-Americans because of Good
Friday and Easter. The Miami relatives have asked the government
not to disturb them during the holy days. The anniversaries of the
Waco incident and the Oklahoma City bombing, both tragedies for the
federal government, also fall this week.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has made clear that she believes the Atlanta court should
not help Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, because he has
violated federal orders to turn Elian over to the government.
Gonzalez, whose Miami family has been taking care of Elian for
almost five months, defied instructions to bring the boy to a
nearby airport last Thursday, when Elian would have been flown to
Washington to reunite with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officially revoked the great-uncle's
custody of the boy when that deadline passed. Elian had been placed
in Gonzalez's care after he was found clinging to an inner-tube off
the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy was one of three survivors of
a capsized refugee boat. His mother, who was divorced from his
father, drowned with 10 other Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Cuban-Americans, Gonzalez opposes President Fidel
Castro's communist rule and has refused to let Elian return to
Cuba. He is asking the Atlanta court to compel the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to grant Elian an asylum hearing. The court
is scheduled to hear oral arguments on May 11.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That decision will likely hinge on who the court decides has the
right to speak for Elian: the great-uncle or Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
the father, who flew from Cuba on April 6 to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the court must decide on both the temporary stay and
a request for an injunction that would prevent Elian from leaving
the country until the court rules on the asylum hearing. That
request was filed last Thursday by lawyers for the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyers also filed a similar lawsuit on Friday asking the
U.S. District Court in Washington to prevent federal officials from
returning Elian to Cuba unless they can guarantee that Castro's
government would not violate the boy's human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials had said that if the boy is turned
over to his father the government would order Elian and his father
to stay in the country until an appellate decision is reached on
the asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson issued the temporary stay last Thursday as tensions
reached a peak outside Elian's Miami home, where more than 4,000
protesters had gathered to prevent the government from removing
Elian. Wednesday morning the scene was much calmer, as dozens of
people waited behind police barricades outside the house. The 50 or
so Cuban-Americans who have been keeping a round-the-clock vigil in
the last several weeks have intensified their watch following
recent comments from federal officials that the government would
enforce the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred place for the child,'' Esteban Nunes, a
construction worker, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who tried in vain last week to negotiate with Elian's
relatives for the boy's return to his father, has refrained from
taking more forceful action. Born in Miami, she served as state
attorney in Miami-Dade County before taking her current post. In
1980, she watched as riots erupted in her hometown after she failed
to win convictions for four white policemen charged with beating to
death a black insurance salesman.

   PUERTO-RICO-ARCHITECTS (San Juan) _ Many young Puerto Rican-born
architects who study and work on the U.S. mainland or outside the
country are giving up jobs with prestigious firms to work on a tiny
Caribbean island of 3.5 million people. For some, moving back means
an opportunity to build on the island's strong Modernist tradition;
for others, it is a chance to address polemical issues of
nationalism and identity in design. By Raul A. Barreneche.
</P>
<P>
   CONTEMPORARY-DESIGN (Milan, Italy) _ At the 2-million square
foot Salone, the world's largest trade exhibition for contemporary
design, as well as two large tandem events and 320 gallery shows
simultaneously hosted in the city, designers ignored the future,
embraced the future or, in the case of a concept chair by a Dutch
team, took a sledgehammer to the present. In the latter case, they
used frustration as a tool for change. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   SNOUT-HOUSES (Portland, Ore.) _ They have seen the enemy creep
into the settled, earth-toned neighborhoods of this city: Houses
that turn their backs to the street. Houses that give no idea where
the front door might be. Snout houses, they call them, all garage
and muscled front facades. And for the past eight months, Portland
has made the snout house illegal. ``You can still build an ugly
house in Portland,'' said Charlie Hales, the city commissioner who
led the effort to ban these houses. ``But now you just have to work
at it a lot harder.'' By Timothy Egan.

WHO WAS PONTIUS PILATE? A THOROUGH LOOK AT JESUS' JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
PONTIUS PILATE 
By Ann Wroe 
Random House, 412 pp. $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a central actor in one of history's greatest moments, and
yet we have available to us mere shreds of his life. But that
hasn't stopped writers across the ages from trying to flesh out the
remains of Pontius Pilate.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that has grown around Pilate is enormous. To some,
he was the ultimate villain _ the man who condemned Jesus, a man
who is central to this Holy Week for Western Christians.
</P>
<P>
   To others, who have sought to cast blame on the Jews of the
time, he was an honorable figure who capitulated to the demand that
Jesus be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   To others, he was a politician willing to sacrifice an
apparently innocent man to keep the peace in a restive outpost of
the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ann Wroe, the American editor of the Economist, weighs in
with her own thoughts,in a compelling, eloquent and vivid work that
offers a complex portrait of Pilate as neither all good nor all
evil. Hers is an ambivalent Pilate, who when faced with the
decision nearly chose to risk it all, but in the end threw up his
arms, sent Jesus to the cross and then wrote a memo to Rome
defending his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one chooses to ascribe to Pilate, our fascination with
the fifth governor of Judea has endured over time because, in
``Pontius Pilate,'' Wroe says, ``he stands at the center of the
Christian story and of God's plan of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without his climactic judgment of Jesus, the world would not
have been saved. Without Christ's death _ pronounced by Pilate _
there would have been no Resurrection, no founding Christian
miracle,'' she writes. ``To have a faceless bureaucrat at the heart
of all this drama was unacceptable: Something had to be made of
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is precious little with which to make something
of Pilate: a few paragraphs from a handful of early Roman histories
and, of course, the well-known accounts in the New Testament. Each
of these, however, is colored by the author's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pilate's actual name is unknown, as is his place of birth.
He might have come from a region south of Rome, or he might have
been born in Seville, Spain, or in a town on the Rhine. A clear
picture of Pilate is frustratingly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But in a superb blend of scholarship and creativity, Wroe weaves
together the many legends that have grown around Pilate into a rich
tapestry that brings this elusive, yet pivotal, figure to life in
the reader's imagination. Pilate was an ``obstinate, proud,
patriotic, cunning, flippant and heavy-handed'' man, Wroe writes,
and an ``immature and hotheaded'' governor ``who seems less on the
edge of destroying the Jews than of destroying himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilate found himself ruling over a volatile corner of the Roman
Empire, the Jewish land whose inhabitants believed they were God's
chosen people, and so were superior to the Romans. Wroe starkly
illustrates how the combination of Pilate's personality and the
Jews' resistance inevitably led to conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And it was these confrontations, Wroe intriguingly intimates,
that set the stage for Pilate's encounter with Jesus. This fierce
and cocky representative of the most powerful empire on earth could
not have his way with the Jews: Their ultimate loyalty was to God,
not Caesar. Instead, Pilate sought an uneasy coexistence with his
subjects, making sure to maintain stability over Judea not because
he harbored any great fondness for the Jews but he feared, more
than anything else, incurring Rome's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus proved a menace to Pilate's tenure because he challenged
the system; his religious convictions were secondary. Jesus, Wroe
writes, ``threatened the established order in two ways: He
proclaimed indifference to it, seeming to recognize laws of his
own, and he was connected by his followers with `kingship' of a
peculiar and ungraspable sort.''
</P>
<P>
   In a splendidly written section, Wroe depicts a vacillating
Pilate interrogating Jesus, agonizing over his judgment, and
leaning toward mercy. But in the end, when the chief priests who
had condemned Jesus to die won to their side the crowd gathered
outside Pilate's home in Jerusalem, Pilate chose a momentous and
notorious path.
</P>
<P>
   Pilate, Wroe notes, was trapped by his own misdeeds. ``For even
if he wanted to be merciful in this case, he dared not be if it
would lead to a blistering report to Rome of everything else he had
done,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the efforts by some chroniclers to lay the blame for
Jesus's death primarily at the feet of the chief rabbis, Wroe makes
a compelling case that Pilate ultimately bears responsibility. Wroe
does a masterful job of forcing us to think about Pilate in new
ways _ as a man wracked by pain, doubt and guilt who sealed his
fate for millennia to come, and of his own accord.
</P>
<P>
   At a singular moment in history, Pilate had the potential ``for
darkness or light . . . He could take untraveled roads, open hidden
doors, escape the bounds of earth and flesh, exceed himself. Or he
could stay as he was: shrug, scratch his ear, write another
memorandum. He stayed as he was. As most of us do.''

 By HERB GREENBERG  
 c.2000 TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As this market goes through its gyrations, I can't help but
think back to a series of columns written by my colleague, Jim
Cramer. It was his manifestos for a new market, and it was
Manifesto No. 5 that caught my attention because it was both
telling and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling in that it did something nobody _ nobody _ has
done: It told what we all knew but nobody dared write: that
analysts, in the end, serve the big mutual funds (and I say also
hedge funds) by hawking stocks that are down (so the funds can sell
or so the stocks in their portfolios can show better returns).
</P>
<P>
   Another version of this story, which he didn't mention, is that
analysts push stocks higher so execs in those companies can dump
their shares at artificially high prices _ but try to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Wall Street really works, and it's something every
reporter (including me) has heard for years but can't write because
it's virtually impossible to come up with the proof.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, as large as it is, is also very small. Whenever
I've gone after ``what everybody knows to be true,'' I've been met
with such resistance as, ``Sorry, I've signed a nondisclosure
agreement'' or ``Sorry, I'd love to help but I also need a job and
this is a very small industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Without documents or on-the-record sources, it's virtually
impossible to report; it gets thrown on the hearsay pile. Cramer
(co-founder of TheStreet.com), on the other hand, can get away with
it because he has nothing to lose. He didn't name names or rely on
documents. Instead, he told what he knows to be true based on what
he sees every day from his front-row seat. (And he's already so
loved or despised that what he says isn't about to make or break
his relationships with anybody.)
</P>
<P>
   It's disturbing, though, in what it represents: That this is a
very ``gamed'' market, and the game is what has played and in all
likelihood will continue to play havoc with prices in the future.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the same game that has ruled the latest leg of this
bull market _ the ``greater fool-theory game'' in which the
savviest traders like Cramer and others use their smarts, research
and instincts to trade ahead of the Johnny-come-lately daytraders.
(Cramer talks of leveling the playing field, but no matter how
level it is there will always be a greater fool.)
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the game of investing in stocks just because they
have big short positions. (The goal of that game is to squeeze the
shorts, which in turn causes a stock's price to rapidly rise as
shorts rush to cover, or buy, their positions.)
</P>
<P>
   And this isn't the game ruled by the message-board maniacs who
congregate in online alleys to orchestrate attacks (long and short)
on stocks. (Such collusion is illegal but the Securities and
Exchange Commission and other regulators will have a tough time
controlling it.)
</P>
<P>
   All of these games are detested by ``purists'' (that would be me
and many of my sources) because they make a mockery of investing
and fundamentals, they make a mockery of discipline (at least for
those who believe in holding something for longer than a day) and
they make a mockery of the notion of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer will tell you that being a purist, right now, won't make
you money. Opportunistic traders like him worship at the Church of
What's Happening Now. It's hard to argue with that kind of logic
because that kind of logic is what generates instant lottery-like
returns.
</P>
<P>
   But by the same token, the drive to make ``who wants to be a
millionaire'' returns, no matter what game is being played, is not
sustainable, especially as more people play the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Cramer's Manifesto No. 5. As he points
out, in not so many words: the Street is rigged. Always has been.
Always will be.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to beat a rig is to know the facts. Facts equal
fundamentals. In the end they win the game every time. Seen
MicroStrategy lately?

<TEXT>
<P>
   As this market goes through its gyrations, I can't help but
think back to a series of columns written by my colleague, Jim
Cramer. It was his manifestos for a new market, and it was
Manifesto No. 5 that caught my attention because it was both
telling and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling in that it did something nobody _ nobody _ has
done: It told what we all knew but nobody dared write: that
analysts, in the end, serve the big mutual funds (and I say also
hedge funds) by hawking stocks that are down (so the funds can sell
or so the stocks in their portfolios can show better returns).
</P>
<P>
   Another version of this story, which he didn't mention, is that
analysts push stocks higher so execs in those companies can dump
their shares at artificially high prices _ but try to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Wall Street really works, and it's something every
reporter (including me) has heard for years but can't write because
it's virtually impossible to come up with the proof.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, as large as it is, is also very small. Whenever
I've gone after ``what everybody knows to be true,'' I've been met
with such resistance as, ``Sorry, I've signed a nondisclosure
agreement'' or ``Sorry, I'd love to help but I also need a job and
this is a very small industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Without documents or on-the-record sources, it's virtually
impossible to report; it gets thrown on the hearsay pile. Cramer
(co-founder of TheStreet.com), on the other hand, can get away with
it because he has nothing to lose. He didn't name names or rely on
documents. Instead, he told what he knows to be true based on what
he sees every day from his front-row seat. (And he's already so
loved or despised that what he says isn't about to make or break
his relationships with anybody.)
</P>
<P>
   It's disturbing, though, in what it represents: That this is a
very ``gamed'' market, and the game is what has played and in all
likelihood will continue to play havoc with prices in the future.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the same game that has ruled the latest leg of this
bull market _ the ``greater fool-theory game'' in which the
savviest traders like Cramer and others use their smarts, research
and instincts to trade ahead of the Johnny-come-lately daytraders.
(Cramer talks of leveling the playing field, but no matter how
level it is there will always be a greater fool.)
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the game of investing in stocks just because they
have big short positions. (The goal of that game is to squeeze the
shorts, which in turn causes a stock's price to rapidly rise as
shorts rush to cover, or buy, their positions.)
</P>
<P>
   And this isn't the game ruled by the message-board maniacs who
congregate in online alleys to orchestrate attacks (long and short)
on stocks. (Such collusion is illegal but the Securities and
Exchange Commission and other regulators will have a tough time
controlling it.)
</P>
<P>
   All of these games are detested by ``purists'' (that would be me
and many of my sources) because they make a mockery of investing
and fundamentals, they make a mockery of discipline (at least for
those who believe in holding something for longer than a day) and
they make a mockery of the notion of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer will tell you that being a purist, right now, won't make
you money. Opportunistic traders like him worship at the Church of
What's Happening Now. It's hard to argue with that kind of logic
because that kind of logic is what generates instant lottery-like
returns.
</P>
<P>
   But by the same token, the drive to make ``who wants to be a
millionaire'' returns, no matter what game is being played, is not
sustainable, especially as more people play the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Cramer's Manifesto No. 5. As he points
out, in not so many words: the Street is rigged. Always has been.
Always will be.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to beat a rig is to know the facts. Facts equal
fundamentals. In the end they win the game every time. Seen
MicroStrategy lately?

&HT;     S.F. MAYOR APOLOGIZES TO CHINESE RESIDENTS FOR THEIR TREATMENT
IN 1906 QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the first time in all the years San
Franciscans have been observing the anniversary of the great 1906
earthquake, an apology shared equal billing with nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   At a predawn ceremony Mayor Willie Brown said Tuesday that San
Francisco owed an apology for its treatment of Chinese residents
before and after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the part of the city of San Francisco, we offer a heartfelt
apology to the Chinese community,`` the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also presented quake survivor Bessie Shum, 96, with a
proclamation making the city's apology official.
</P>
<P>
   Shum is the first Chinese American survivor to attend the
memorial gathering, a San Francisco tradition since it started in
1919.
</P>
<P>
   She was two years old when her family fled Chinatown as fire
swept the city in the aftermath of the quake. She was carried by a
neighbor. Her father carried her mother, whose feet were bound.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinatown was then the most densely populated section
of San Francisco, only a dozen Chinese names appear on the official
list of 674 dead and missing. Shum said the bones of many Chinese
had been shipped to China after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight survivors of the quake attended predawn Tuesday's
ceremony, the
</P>
<P>
   most for a decade. Among them was 101-year-old Mariam Cowan, a
theatrical
</P>
<P>
   performer and onetime major-domo a notorious madam named Sally
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of silence at 5:12 a.m., then a mournful wail
from a dozen fire engines - and then the party started, with the
crowd singing ``San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicist Lee Housekeeper attributed the larger-than-usual
number of quake survivors to the Westin St. Francis' generous
gesture of providing rooms for all.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were served the same breakfast that was on the St.
Francis menu when the earthquake struck: chilled rhubarb, stewed
prunes, thinly sliced fruit and berries with yogurt, pastries, rice
griddle cakes, southern hominy with cream and scrambled eggs with
black truffles.
</P>
<P>
   At noon the crowd of quake survivors grew to 50, five of them
centenarians.

FOR FAUCETS, A VARIETY OF MATERIALS AND FINISHES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are three reasons to replace a kitchen or bathroom faucet:
If it is malfunctioning and cannot be repaired, if the finish is
worn and pitted or if you want to replace an old one with one that
is more stylish.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not shopped for fixtures in a while, you may be
surprised at the wide variety. Prices range from about $30 to more
than $400, and models are available in metal or plastic with an
assortment of finishes.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to buy a new faucet to fit an existing sink, then
you must buy a model of the correct size. This is determined by
measuring the distane, or spread, between the holes in the
lavatory or sink shelf. Usually there are three holes: two for the
faucets and a center one for the spout or stopper post. Measure the
distance between the center points in the outside holes.
</P>
<P>
   Some sinks have spreads of only 4 inches across. They require a
unit that has the spout and faucets mounted together on a single
base. You must purchase the new fixture to match this
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   After determining the size you need, consider the material the
fixture is made of. Cheap fixtures are made of plastic plated with
thin metal. The low price of these units may seem appealing, but
the metal finish is largely cosmetic and will quickly wear away.
</P>
<P>
   Faucets with die-cast zinc alloy bodies are more durable, and
also more expensive. These pieces are plated with chrome or brass
to protect the zinc from corrosion, and they will wear well until
the plating deteriorates; then they will start to corrode.
</P>
<P>
   Solid-brass fixtures are the most durable and also the most
expensive. They require less care than fixtures made from other
materials and are more resistant to the corrosion caused by
minerals in hard water. Solid-brass fixtures may have a chrome- or
nickel-electroplated finish. If not, they should have a proprietary
lifetime finish (Delta Brilliance, Moen LifeShine and Jado Diamond
are popular finishes for brass fixtures).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is difficult to tell what any fixture is made of
if it has chrome plating. The manufacturer should specify whether
the faucet is all-brass body or brass- or chrome-plated on the
package. Usually, you can judge the metal quality by the weight of
the piece. Brass fixtures are heavier than faucets made of plastic
or zinc alloy.
</P>
<P>
   Finish is important, because it determines the appearance of a
fixture and how easy it will be to maintain. Fixtures with pewter
or satin finishes are easy to care for because the matte surface
hides scratches, fingerprints and water spots. Fixtures with shiny
chrome and brass finishes show water spots and soap film readily,
so they must be polished often.
</P>
<P>
   Handle configuration is another important option. Traditional
fixtures have two handles, one for hot water, the other for cold.
Many modern faucets have a single handle that controls both hot and
cold water. Some safety experts feel that one-handle faucets are
safer in homes with small children. The handle can be left in the
cold water mode, so a small child opening the tap will not be
scalded by hot water. While this is a good safety feature, it is no
substitute for lowering the thermostat setting on the water heater
to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Handle shapes include cross pattern, round knobs and lever
grips. Round knobs have a stylish look that works well with modern
design schemes, but they are difficult to grip and turn. Lever
handles are a better choice for older users or anyone who has
trouble manipulating round knobs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider the valve mechanism inside the faucet, because
it can affect the price and reliability of the fixture. The
compression faucet is oldest type of mechanism. Turning the handle
raises the valve stem inside the faucet. This lifts the rubber
washer off the mouth of the valve and allows water to flow through.
The washers will deteriorate with exposure to hard water or if the
stem is overtightened, but replacement washers are cheap and easy
to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Faucets with ball valves have a single handle and an internal
ball mechanism that is turned to align with the hot and cold
openings. Ball valves are durable and require less maintenance than
compression faucets, but they have a number of small internal parts
so they can be tedious to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeve-cartridge faucets have a single unit, a cartridge that
controls the water supply. The cartridges are used in one- and
two-handled faucets. Fixing a leaky faucet requires opening it up
and replacing the entire cartridge with a new piece of the same
configuration. This is a relatively simple task, but replacement
cartridges can run as high as $20.

   ``Interpreter of Maladies''
</P>
<P>
   by Jhumpa Lahiri
</P>
<P>
   Short fiction
</P>
<P>
   Mariner Books, $12
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Pulitzer Prize committee of 2000 knew something
about last year's published fiction that almost all the rest of us
missed: Jhumpa Lahiri's short-story collection, ``Interpreter of
Maladies,'' is fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Houghton Mifflin in 1999, ``Interpreter'' didn't so
much fade quickly from sight as fail to make any impact at all.
Lahiri was an unknown first-time author, her name was hard to
spell, and the book's subject _ short stories about Indians in
India and America _ seemed less than spellbinding. Almost no
marketing effort was put into the title, and readers and critics
alike largely ignored it _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait. Go buy a copy while you can.
</P>
<P>
   Each of ``Interpreter's'' nine stories is a standout. Lahiri
writes in a deceptively simple style. Her characters truly talk to,
rather than at, each other; exquisite details _ the texture of
cereal, dust altering the color of a monkey's fur _ proliferate.
Perhaps it could be described as gentle Hemingway, except, unlike
Papa, Lahiri writes about people who aren't larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   The title story, for example, finds a tour guide/cab driver in
India unexpectedly hearing the confession of a young American
mother with a special secret. Discovering the secret, as our cab
driver does, is not what the story is about; instead, it's all
about how the characters respond to _ and how they are affected by
_ the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Each story has its own unique strength and perspective. But in
the course of ``Interpreter'' being read and discussed, it is
inevitable that the collection's concluding story, ``The Third and
Final Continent,'' will be hailed as the ultimate classic. Nothing
dramatic happens here, except the very real fact that all lives are
dramatic, each in its own way. A humble Indian comes to Boston to
work in a university library. Because he is approaching middle age,
his mother arranges a marriage for him; the bride is also older,
someone rejected by previous suitors for being too plain. They are
awkward with each other and uncomfortable in their new country, but
their initial gawky companionship turns into love, and we learn
their eventual fates 30 years after the story began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a son who attends Harvard University ... So we drive
to Cambridge to visit him, or bring him home for a weekend, so that
he can eat rice with us with his hands, and speak in Bengali,
things we sometimes worry he will no longer do after we die. I know
my achievement is quite ordinary. Still, there are times I am
bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten,
each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As
ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a moving, powerful story to be read over and over, with the
simple message that no life is ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Lahiri herself should be a potent literary force for decades to
come. Now 32, she was born in England and raised in Rhode Island.
She has a Ph.D. in literature from Boston University, and she
shuttles back and forth between the United States and her parents'
native India.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of her future fiction remains to be seen (she's
currently working on a novel). But if ``Interpreter of Maladies''
is any indication of what is yet to come, this young woman is a
literary treasure. We have the Pulitzer Committee to thank for
bringing her to our belated attention.

   Harvesting Pea Vines
</P>
<P>
   Q. At a chic restaurant recently, I tasted tendrils from a pea
vine. Can I harvest the tips from the plant in my garden and still
have peas later on?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Long before pea vines became fashionable, a woodchuck taught
me that you can prune severely and still get a crop of peas. In
fact, since pruning forces the vines to branch, you might get more
peas than ever. But there is some risk, because pruning sets back
growth and delays flowering. If the weather turns hot before the
vines reach full size, you could end up with a smaller crop or no
crop at all.
</P>
<P>
   Start by deciding what kind of vine you want to end up with.
Trendy American chefs favor what might be called pea scribbles.
These tangles of tightly curled tendrils come from plants known as
afila peas. Marketed under such variety names as Godiva and
Novella, afilas make tendrils instead of leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   Asian chefs prefer the vine tops of snow peas such as Oregon
Sugar Pod and Snowflake. Though less dramatic-looking than afila
tendrils, snow pea vines are tastier and more tender. (The vines of
regular garden peas are edible, but tend to be fibrous and bland.)
</P>
<P>
   Sow seeds as soon as possible, following the directions on the
packet. When the plants are about 14 inches tall, cut off the top
six inches _ four inches for afila types _ making the cut right
above a leaf node. The plants will branch where you made the cut
and resume growing to the normal height for the variety. Depending
on weather, flowering will be about a week to 10 days later than on
unpruned plants.
</P>
<P>
   Snow pea seeds are widely available. Novella seeds are sold by
R.H. Shumway, P.O. Box 1, Graniteville, S.C. 29829 (803-663-9771).
A snap pea version, Sugar Lace, is new this year from Park Seed, 1
Parkton Ave., Greenwood, S.C. 29647 (800-845-3369). Catalogs from
both are free.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting pea-vine field study, conducted by Washington
State University, is available at
http://agsyst.wsu.edu/peareport.htm
</P>
<P>
   Happy Wanderers
</P>
<P>
   Q. While in Tasmania last August (the end of winter there,
beginning of spring), I saw a bush with a profusion of small purple
blooms. My guide said it is called ``Happy Wanderer.'' I also saw a
vine that shared the same name and appearance. Was is the botanical
name, and is it available in North America?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The botanical name of the plant Australians call Happy
Wanderer is Hardenbergia violacea, known in the United States as
coral pea. Here, Happy Wanderer is a specific variety of H.
violacea sold at some garden centers. Other purple-flowered
violaceas are available, and so are white and pink forms of the
same plant.
</P>
<P>
   Though H. violacea can be either a vine or a bush, only the vine
is sold in America. In Australia it's a rampant grower, but in most
parts of the United States, it can be grown only indoors. H.
violacea will survive an occasional dip to the mid-20s
(Fahrenheit), but grudgingly. Anything colder will kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Even in very warm areas where it can live outdoors, it tends to
be well behaved, said Kathy Musial, a curator at the Huntington
Botanical Gardens in Los Angeles, who has found it far more polite
than the wisteria it otherwise brings to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Since coral pea sets flower buds in fall, the sooner you start
growing yours, the better. It will put on size all through the
summer before it stops growing and starts making flowers, so you
will have more of them in the blooming season, December through
March. (Those flowers will be pea-like, by the way; H. violacea
also resembles wisteria in being a legume.)
</P>
<P>
   Purple and white H. violacea are sold by Logee's Greenhouses,
141 North St., Danielson, Ct. 06239 (888-330-8038); a catalog is
$4.95. Seeds of the pink and white vine forms, and of a related
variety, H. comptoniana, which has purple flowers, are available
from J.L. Hudson, Seedsman, Star Rte. 2, Box 337, La Honda, Calif.
94020; catalog $1.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are three reasons to replace a kitchen or bathroom faucet:
If it is malfunctioning and cannot be repaired, if the finish is
worn and pitted or if you want to replace an old one with one that
is more stylish.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not shopped for fixtures in a while, you may be
surprised at the wide variety. Prices range from about $30 to more
than $400, and models are available in metal or plastic with an
assortment of finishes.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to buy a new faucet to fit an existing sink, then
you must buy a model of the correct size. This is determined by
measuring the distance, or spread, between the holes in the
lavatory or sink shelf. Usually there are three holes: two for the
faucets and a center one for the spout or stopper post. Measure the
distance between the center points in the outside holes.
</P>
<P>
   Some sinks have spreads of only 4 inches across. They require a
unit that has the spout and faucets mounted together on a single
base. You must purchase the new fixture to match this
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   After determining the size you need, consider the material the
fixture is made of. Cheap fixtures are made of plastic plated with
thin metal. The low price of these units may seem appealing, but
the metal finish is largely cosmetic and will quickly wear away.
</P>
<P>
   Faucets with die-cast zinc alloy bodies are more durable, and
also more expensive. These pieces are plated with chrome or brass
to protect the zinc from corrosion, and they will wear well until
the plating deteriorates; then they will start to corrode.
</P>
<P>
   Solid-brass fixtures are the most durable and also the most
expensive. They require less care than fixtures made from other
materials and are more resistant to the corrosion caused by
minerals in hard water. Solid-brass fixtures may have a chrome- or
nickel-electroplated finish. If not, they should have a proprietary
lifetime finish (Delta Brilliance, Moen LifeShine and Jado Diamond
are popular finishes for brass fixtures).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is difficult to tell what any fixture is made of
if it has chrome plating. The manufacturer should specify whether
the faucet is all-brass body or brass- or chrome-plated on the
package. Usually, you can judge the metal quality by the weight of
the piece. Brass fixtures are heavier than faucets made of plastic
or zinc alloy.
</P>
<P>
   Finish is important, because it determines the appearance of a
fixture and how easy it will be to maintain. Fixtures with pewter
or satin finishes are easy to care for because the matte surface
hides scratches, fingerprints and water spots. Fixtures with shiny
chrome and brass finishes show water spots and soap film readily,
so they must be polished often.
</P>
<P>
   Handle configuration is another important option. Traditional
fixtures have two handles, one for hot water, the other for cold.
Many modern faucets have a single handle that controls both hot and
cold water. Some safety experts feel that one-handle faucets are
safer in homes with small children. The handle can be left in the
cold water mode, so a small child opening the tap will not be
scalded by hot water. While this is a good safety feature, it is no
substitute for lowering the thermostat setting on the water heater
to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Handle shapes include cross pattern, round knobs and lever
grips. Round knobs have a stylish look that works well with modern
design schemes, but they are difficult to grip and turn. Lever
handles are a better choice for older users or anyone who has
trouble manipulating round knobs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider the valve mechanism inside the faucet, because
it can affect the price and reliability of the fixture. The
compression faucet is oldest type of mechanism. Turning the handle
raises the valve stem inside the faucet. This lifts the rubber
washer off the mouth of the valve and allows water to flow through.
The washers will deteriorate with exposure to hard water or if the
stem is overtightened, but replacement washers are cheap and easy
to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Faucets with ball valves have a single handle and an internal
ball mechanism that is turned to align with the hot and cold
openings. Ball valves are durable and require less maintenance than
compression faucets, but they have a number of small internal parts
so they can be tedious to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeve-cartridge faucets have a single unit, a cartridge that
controls the water supply. The cartridges are used in one- and
two-handled faucets. Fixing a leaky faucet requires opening it up
and replacing the entire cartridge with a new piece of the same
configuration. This is a relatively simple task, but replacement
cartridges can run as high as $20.

&HT;        VERDICT STILL OUT ON BAYH AS VEEP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Tania Anderson  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- There's no doubt that most Hoosiers would like to
see their former governor and current Senator, Evan Bayh, in the
vice president's seat. But whether he'll actually get the nod from
Democratic contender Al Gore is very much up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from Indiana and Washington seem to be split on
whether the freshman senator has what it takes to beat out a list
of old school politicians and make Indiana important enough to the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers say things like: ``He has no stature,'' said
William Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst. ``It would not
be a choice for Gore to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bayh himself doubts he'll be picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's most likely someone else will be chosen,''
Bayh said in an interview Friday. ``I have no control over the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimists say: ``One of the things that makes Bayh such a
good possibility is that he's a strong young person that has
(focused) on many of those same issues that Al Gore has,'' said
Mike Panos, chairman of Gore's campaign in Indiana, who is based in
Merrillville. ``People in the Gore campaign feel good about Evan
Bayh.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of a running mate is a highly personal decision
for the candidates and one they keep private until the first party
convention of the year. It's also a decision based on the various
vote- getting qualities that a running mate could add to the ticket
like their home state, ethnic background and gender. Professional
and personal backgrounds also play a major role.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits say that what Bayh has in his favor is similarities with
Gore like growing up with fathers who were senators, both attending
St. Albans, a Washington private school, and both holding moderate
democratic views. Gore could be attracted to the fact that Bayh
helped establish a Democratic base in the state after two terms as
governor, especially in a traditionally faithful conservative
state. He also was the first Democratic senator from Indiana to be
elected in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in (Midwestern) states remember Birch Bayh,''
said Brian Howey, editor of the Howey Political Report, of Evan
Bayh's father, who served in the Senate for three terms. ``The name
really is a multi-generational name and packs some clout and punch
in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not in his favor is his inexperience and lack of exposure
as a U.S. senator, Indiana's small number of electorate votes, a
possible association with fellow Hoosier Dan Quayle and competition
from other potential running mates. Indiana has 12 electoral votes,
a small piece of the 270 votes actually needed to win the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if he'll pick him,'' said Thomas L. Smith, chairman of
the fourth district's Democratic party. ``I think he's on a short
list but I don't know if he has enough experience and exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats mentioned for the Gore ticket are Florida Sen.
Bob Graham, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Gov. Gray
Davis, Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardsen and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt from
Missouri. The Gore campaign refuses to comment on the list of
potential running mates. Former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher was recently appointed to help narrow down Gore's
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's vice presidential selection, which will most likely be
announced at the Republican Convention July 31 in Philadelphia,
weighs heavily in whether Bayh will get picked by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some say if Bush chooses a female running mate like former
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole or New Jersey Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman, Gore may be inclined to follow suit by also selecting
a woman. If Bush selects a state governor like Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Ridge, Bayh's chances of getting selected could increase if
Gore also wants a running mate who worked as a governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good argument for Bayh,'' said Doug Davidoff,
communications director of the Indiana Democratic party. ``There's
always a chance (it'll) be somebody nobody's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bayh could help Gore win votes in Midwestern states, which
are the hardest to get in presidential races, some dispute whether
Indiana is strong enough to give Bayh that edge over other
midwestern politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana doesn't help you carry states like Michigan and
Ohio,'' Schneider said. ``In Ohio, Indiana is a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bayh is sheepish about the whole situation. He said he's
flattered by the rumor but is focused on his role as the state's
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's an honor to be considered,'' Bayh said.
``Clearly it's the kind of thing that I wouldn't turn down but I'd
have to talk to (my wife) Susan about it before.''

&HT;     DEAD KENNEDYS PUNK-ROCK BAND DRAGS ITS FEUD INTO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After spending 1979 to 1986 as one of the
nation's most notorious anti-establishment punk-rock band, members
of the Dead Kennedys have
</P>
<P>
   conformed to a practice associated with the most commercial
groups of the era: hauling former band mates into court.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year-old fight over the band's legacy is scheduled for
trial this week as jury selection begins in Dead Kennedys vs. Jello
Biafra.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedys singer-songwriter Biafra claims his former band mates
tried to hijack his record label, Alternative Tentacles, after he
refused to sell the Dead Kennedys' song ``Holiday in Cambodia'' to
Levi's for a TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   The three other members _ guitarist East Bay Ray, bassist Klaus
Fluoride and drummer D.H. Peligro _ deny those allegations,
claiming Biafra has been using profits from the band's records to
support his post-Kennedys career as a spoken-word artist. They also
want about $75,000 in Dead Kennedys royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting legal battle has generated encyclopedic volumes of
paperwork that have to be wheeled in and out of the courtroom on a
cart. The latest round of settlement talks failed in December, with
both sides agreeing to put the fate of the band in the hands of 12
San Francisco jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been emotionally devastating,'' Biafra said. ``The whole
thing has pretty much wasted two years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, ugly legal battles have been commonplace among members of
'70s and '80s arena rock bands. What makes the Dead Kennedys
different is their dedication from their inception not to get
sucked into the exploited-artist, attorney-infested world of
corporate music.
</P>
<P>
   Their record company was named with that industry in mind, set
up to be an alternative to the tentacles of the major labels,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a decade after they last played together, both
sides in the band have lofted the worst insult in the world of punk
rock: accusing the other of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   Biafra's take: ``They basically want to force me into corporate
prostitution, so they can put music that I wrote into TV
commercials for corporations I'm here
</P>
<P>
   protesting (against), then have me take all the blame while they
sit in suburbia and count dollar bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, Fluoride and Peligro's take: ``We think Biafra's acting
like a capitalist in the worst sense of the word,'' Ray said. ``He
may not be a corporation, but he certainly knows how to act like
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Kennedys put out five studio albums over seven years
under the San Francisco-based Alternative Tentacles label. Since
the group broke up in 1986, the label has produced Biafra's side
projects and spoken-word albums, along with scores of bands, good
and bad, all of which never reached the fame or sales of the Dead
Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, Fluoride and Peligro sued in October 1998, claiming Biafra
shortchanged them on royalties and mismanaged Alternative
Tentacles, using the label's resources to promote no-name bands
when he should have been supporting the Kennedys catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Biafra, who lost a race for San Francisco mayor and is a current
Green Party presidential candidate, followed with a lawsuit
accusing the band of retaliating after he vetoed the use of
``Holiday in Cambodia'' in a commercial for Dockers pants.

<P>
   In a victory for the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez, a
federal court in Atlanta Wednesday issued an injunction that
prevents the boy from leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision did not bar the federal government from
reuniting Elian with his father in this country. The boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, traveled from Cuba on April 6 to claim his
son. He has said he would stay in this country if the international
custody battle turns into a prolonged legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court rejected the government's request to
lift a temporary stay order that was barring the boy from leaving
the country. The court said it found the government's argument
``not compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno was traveling to Oklahoma City and
did not immediately issue a statement on the ruling. It was not
clear what action the federal government would take. Officials had
said they would not do anything until the ruling was announced.
</P>
<P>
   But at a Washington news conference Wednesday morning, Reno said
that the U.S. government might have to use force to take Elian
Gonzalez from his Miami relatives in order to reunite him with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may come a time when there is no other alternative,''
Reno said. ``But we've got to do it in a careful, thoughtful way.
No child should be in that kind of never-never land for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary stay was issued last Thursday by Judge J.L.
Edmondson of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and
remains in effect until the three-judge panel makes a ruling on it.
</P>
<P>
   The judges had been reviewing copies of the briefs since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision and Reno's comments Wednesday come during a
week that holds religious significance for many Cuban-Americans
because of Good Friday and Easter. The Miami relatives have asked
the government not to disturb them during the holy days. The
anniversaries of the Branch Davidian debacle in Waco, Texas, and
the Oklahoma City bombing, both tragedies for the federal
government, also fall this week.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has made clear that she believes the Atlanta court should
not help Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, because he has
violated federal orders to turn Elian over to the government.
Gonzalez, whose Miami family has been taking care of Elian for
almost five months, defied instructions to bring the boy to a
nearby airport last Thursday, when Elian would have been flown to
Washington to reunite with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officially revoked the great-uncle's
custody of the boy when that deadline passed. Elian had been placed
in Gonzalez's care after he was found clinging to an inner-tube off
the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy was one of three survivors of
a capsized refugee boat. His mother, who was divorced from his
father, drowned with 10 other Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Cuban-Americans, Gonzalez opposes President Fidel
Castro's communist rule and has refused to let Elian return to
Cuba. He is asking the Atlanta court to compel the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to grant Elian an asylum hearing. The court
is scheduled to hear oral arguments on May 11.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That decision will likely hinge on who the court decides has the
right to speak for Elian: the great-uncle or Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
the father.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami relatives also filed a lawsuit Friday
asking the U.S. District Court in Washington to prevent federal
officials from returning Elian to Cuba unless they can guarantee
that Castro's government would not violate the boy's human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials had said that if the boy is turned
over to his father the government would order Elian and his father
to stay in the country until an appellate decision is reached on
the asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson issued the temporary stay last Thursday as tensions
reached a peak outside Elian's Miami home, where more than 4,000
protesters had gathered to prevent the government from removing
Elian. Wednesday morning the scene was much calmer, as dozens of
people waited behind police barricades outside the house. The 50 or
so Cuban-Americans who have been keeping a round-the-clock vigil in
the last several weeks have intensified their watch following
recent comments from federal officials that the government would
enforce the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred place for the child,'' Esteban Nunes, a
construction worker, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who tried in vain last week to negotiate with Elian's
relatives for the boy's return to his father, has refrained from
taking more forceful action. Born in Miami, she served as state
attorney in Miami-Dade County before taking her current post. In
1980, she watched as riots erupted in her hometown after she failed
to win convictions for four white policemen charged with beating to
death a black insurance salesman.

THE MARKET, MCCAIN AND MIRANDA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on current events:
</P>
<P>
   THE STOCK MARKET: What a way to make a living. I've known
professional horse players who faced less stress and uncertainty on
a daily basis than these folks who wager on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   My total involvement with Wall Street consists of a 401(k) plan
that barely has enough money in it to justify the paperwork that
goes along with it. But I still call the investment company's hot
line to check the balance when the markets have these wild
fluctuations, just to see how I've been affected by the recurring
plunges, rebounds, crashes and recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, usually, is not much. But if those menacing ``Stocks
plunge'' headlines send chills up the spines of penny ante
investors like me, can you imagine what they must do to Wall Street
high rollers who can see their net worth evaporate in a matter of
hours?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: John McCain says he won't run as an
independent because he's loyal to the Republican Party. That's
nice. But if he's such a good Republican, why doesn't McCain stop
playing ``hard to get'' and declare his unequivocal, enthusiastic
support for the nominee-to-be, George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, he's been getting rave reviews from the media for
his accessibility _ daily news conferences, frequent interviews,
etc. _ which is ironic, considering that he was previously
portrayed by the pro-McCain news hounds as a hermit who was afraid
to face the media hordes. Do you suppose the new assessment has
something to do with Al Gore's recent penchant for hiding from the
press?
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are so easy. They love anyone who talks to them.
</P>
<P>
   GUN CONTROL: Thursday is the one-year anniversary of the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado, and the anti-gun
movement doesn't seem to be even slightly embarrassed by its crass
exploitation of the tragedy to promote its political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the National Rifle Association and other supporters of gun
rights can be stubborn and self-defeating, but the other side truly
ought to be ashamed of itself for trampling victims' graves.
Instead of using occasions such as the Columbine anniversary to
lobby for gun laws, couldn't the gun-haters just shut up and let
the victims' loved ones mourn in peace?
</P>
<P>
   THE MIRANDA WARNING: If you can't recite it _ ``You have the
right to remain silent ... anything you say can and will be used
against you'' _ then you haven't been watching all those
cop-and-lawyer shows on television. But the so-called Miranda
warning amounts to a heck of a lot more than TV dialogue: It
signifies the U.S. Constitution's guarantee against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Supreme Court is gearing up to decide if the police
really need to be bothered with Miranda. Seems that Congress passed
a law way back in 1968 that might have negated the Miranda
requirement, which had been imposed by the Supreme Court two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   I know about as much about the law as I do about the stock
market, but here's a prediction: The Supreme Court will uphold
Miranda. The rule has become too ingrained in the criminal justice
system to just toss it out the window. Besides, how would TV cops
fill up all those hourlong shows if they didn't have to Mirandize
everybody they arrested?
</P>
<P>
   THE CUBAN BOY CONTROVERSY: Dr. Irwin Redlener, a professor of
pediatrics who has advised the government on the Elian Gonzalez
mess, says that the boy's Miami relatives are being
``psychologically abusive'' and that Elian should be returned to
his father immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child needs to be rescued,'' Redlener said.
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL: A recent column about my ongoing baseball boycott
prompted a reader to send me his list of 51 reasons ``why baseball
is the sorriest sport of all.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of my favorites.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2: ``Seven players stand bored while two players play
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 4: ``Darryl Strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 11: ``Steve Howe.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 39: ``Too many `beer guts' (players and spectators) in the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 49: ``Warning tracks are for sissies.''

YOU CAN LANCELOT OF OLDE-FASHIONED VICTUALS AT RENAISSANCE FAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is time for Scarborough Faire, which in Texas means you only
have a couple of months to enjoy the Renaissance festival before it
gets too hot to dress up in unflattering tights and steaming suits
of armor.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been to Scarborough Faire, in Waxahachie, south of
Dallas, though this is its 20th anniversary. The wardrobe is
probably part of it, the heat another. I know I don't really have
to go in costume, but beyond that, the whole idea of a Renaissance
festival is to enjoy the pleasures of the 16th century, and I'm not
convinced those were great times _ plagues, armadas, big bloody
wars and things like that.
</P>
<P>
   The food is the main thing for me at festivals like Scarborough
Faire. I guess the jousting is fun, and the falconry. Certainly we
guys all like to look at the wenches; the trick is not getting
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't write me to say using the term ``wenches'' is not
politically correct. It is part of Scarborough Faire's own
publicity and they even have a ``Woo the Wench'' contest. Get a
life.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't want a Renaissance festival without wenches, or
roasted turkey legs, for that matter. I'm not sure they even had
roasted turkey legs back in the 16th century, but if they didn't,
they should have.
</P>
<P>
   They do at Scarborough Faire.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they were big drinkers back in the 1500s. Doing some
reading on Elizabethan food, I found the following liquid measures:
``A tun is equal to 2 butts, or 4 hogsheads, or 252 gallons.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to love someone who measures their liquids in those
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I found that meats were often cooked a little sweeter than
we do them now. The English cooks, and probably most Europeans,
cooked their meat with a lot of fruits for a sweet and savory
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes were still kind of a novelty, and folks still
considered tomatoes poisonous. Popular vegetables were turnips and
parsnips.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate was used only for medicinal purposes, and the
chocolate they had was unsweetened and bitter. Coffee and tea were
also considered medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Wild game was popular, but generally speaking, you had to be a
landowner to hunt the game, and most of the land was owned by
precious few. The peasants had to make do on bread dishes. Meat,
fish and fruit were rare.
</P>
<P>
   When the poor folks did get meat, it was often spoiled and they
had to use a lot of spices to cover the ripe taste. Also, it wasn't
uncommon to use oatmeal as a thickener for stews.
</P>
<P>
   They don't do that at Scarborough Faire. I have a sneaky
suspicion that some of the dishes they serve at the festival are
not really period recipes at all.
</P>
<P>
   There are 60 food items in all available at various food stands
on the Scarborough Faire site. Some of them have an
all-too-familiar ring to them.
</P>
<P>
   For example: I have a hard time thinking of a royal knight
riding along with his visor down, eating a New World fajita. How
about a grilled seafood salad? Try that with your falcon resting on
your forearm.
</P>
<P>
   And where does the shrimp etouffee come from, and the red beans
and rice? I just can't see a Cajun in a sheet-metal outfit.
</P>
<P>
   There is chicken on a stick, Canterbury pork pockets and steak
on a stake.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the menu looks good. There is something for
everyone, and if you can graze your way through the 35-acre
compound, it can't be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fair kicked off last weekend and will run through
June 4, Saturdays and Sundays, including Memorial Day. For more
information on ticket prices and special events, call (972)
938-FAIR (3247).
</P>
<P>
   Just for the heck of it, in salute to the 16th century and
Scarborough Faire's 20th anniversary, here is a legitimate
15th-century recipe for stewed capon that was still popular in the
16th century, or so they say. It is taken from ``Two Fifteenth
Century Cookery Books'' (1430-1450), Thomas Austin Ed., Early
English Text Society, Oxford University Press, 1964. The cooking
directions were translated by David Friedman and Elizabeth Cook.

<P>
   Original directions
</P>
<P>
   Take parcelly, Sauge, Isoppe, Rose Mary, and tyme, and breke hit
bitwen thi hondes, and stoppe the Capon there-with; colour hym with
Safferon, and couche hym in a erthen potte, or of brasse, and ley
splentes underneth and al about the sides, that the Capon touche no
thinge of the potte; strawe good herbes in the potte, and put
thereto a pottel of the best wyn that thou may gete, and none other
licour; hele the potte with a close led, and stoppe hit aboute with
dogh or bater, that no eier come oute; And set hit on the faire
charcole, and lete it seeth easly and longe till hit be ynowe. And
if hit be an erthen potte, then set hit on the fire whan thou
takest hit downe, and lete hit not touche the grounde for breking;
And whan the hete is ouer past, take oute the Capon with a prik;
then make a sirippe of wyne, Reysons of corance, sugur and

</P>
<P>
   Serves 6-8
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken, about 5 to 6 pounds
</P>
<P>
   First batch of herbs: 1/3 cup fresh parsley, 1 tablespoon dried
sage, 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon thyme, ground, 2
tablespoons hyssop, dried
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   6 threads saffron plus 1 teaspoon water
</P>
<P>
   Second batch of herbs: 1/2 teaspoon tarragon, 1/2 teaspoon sage,
1/2 teaspoon rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup flour, enough water to make a stiff dough
</P>
<P>
   Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup currants
</P>
<P>
   Small pinch saffron
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon powdered ginger
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Mix first batch of herbs and stuff chicken with
them. Put chicken and wine in a pot with a top; if you are using a
stove top rather than an oven, you may want to put wood pieces or
something under the chicken to keep it from sticking. Paint the
chicken with water with saffron crushed into it. Sprinkle on second
batch of herbs. Mix flour and water into a stiff dough, roll it out
into a string, and use it between pot and lid as a seal. Bake at
350 degrees, or simmer on stove top about 11/2 hours. Take out,
drain, separate out some of the liquid without the fat. Make a
thick syrup of wine, sugar, currants and a pinch of saffron. Boil
briefly. Mix another 1/4 cup wine with powdered ginger. Combine.
Add 1/2 cup of the broth from the chicken to this, heat, pour over
chicken, serve.

PLENTY OF BARKS AND BYTES, NO HOUSEKEEPING REQUIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Chinese calendar, this is the Year of the Dragon, but a
group of toy and consumer electronics manufacturers would not be
unhappy if it turned out to be the year of the dog _ the
interactive, robotic dog, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including Fisher-Price and Toy Biz, are
rolling out computerized canines this spring and fall, following in
the path of Sony's Aibo (pronounced EYE-bo), a limited production
robot dog that cost $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The new mechanical palm puppies are less sophisticated, but also
less expensive. They bark, wag their plastic tails and beg for the
affections of anyone willing to pay about $30 to $150 to buy them.
And unlike toy dogs of the pre-PC era, these tech pets seem to
develop behaviors that respond to how their owners play with them.
</P>
<P>
   The first to reach retail shelves is Poo-Chi, the Interactive
Puppy. Made by the people who created the Furby, Tiger Electronics,
a division of Hasbro, Poo-Chi went on sale Wednesday in the United
States at the Manhattan store of FAO Schwarz, where the pseudo
pooches were delivered to the store by dog sled, and at the FAO
Schwarz Web site (www.fao.com).
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi is sensitive to light, touch and sound. It can't walk,
but it can sit, stand and rock on its tiptoes. It can also flap its
ears and open and close its toothless mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Its eyes, red shapes on an LED screen, even show expressions.
When plastic bone is placed near Poo-Chi's nose (which contains an
infrared sensor), ther eyes become heart shapes. The dogs also bark
out six songs, including ``I've been working on the railroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi, which was co-produced by Sega Toys, based in Japan,
went on sale in Japan this month. Shoppers bought 100,000 of them
in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our history with Furby, based on the advanced buzz
product, based on what happened in Japan, we think it's got all the
earmarks for one of those crazy phenomena of the toy world,'' said
David Niggli, chief operating officer of FAO Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger executives said the company was preparing a more advanced
(and probably more expensive) version of Poo-Chi for the market.
And later this year, Tiger will release i-Cybie, a much more
sophisticated robotic dog that will cost about $150.
</P>
<P>
   Shown at this year's Toy Fair in New York was Robotic Puppy by
Fisher- Price, Tekno by Manley Toy Quest and Puppy Magic, a sort of
a hybrid of an electronic dog and a plush toy by Toy Biz, a
division of Marvel Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Robotic Puppy responds to a series of pre-set commands that can
be delivered orally over a headset or manually with a remote
control pad.
</P>
<P>
   Tekno can be trained to do simple tricks by way of a related Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Puppy Magic, which comes with a litter of four newborn puppies,
uses electronic sensors and mechanics to give the impression that
the mother dog recognizes and cares for her offspring.  &QL;

 &HT;    What's next? It's Oprah - the magazine
 &HT;    By Dan Neal
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After yakking her way to zillionairehood
with her TV talk show, Oprah Winfrey shuts her yap today, puts pen
to paper and prepares to make another pile with a new career _
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out she ain't half bad.
</P>
<P>
   O, The Oprah Magazine hit newsstands nationwide Wednesday
morning, trumpeting on its cover an irresistible promise: ``Live
Your Best Life!''
</P>
<P>
   Does it deliver? Maybe _ if you're a woman age 25-49 in search
of ``a personal-growth guide,'' as Winfrey describes her mag.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-plus-page glossy tome is teeming with tasty stuff,
including Oprah's chat with Camille Cosby about the murder of
Cosby's son, columns from some big-name writers like Peggy Noonan
on relationships, finance, fitness, food, fashion, working and
more, excerpts from singer Jewel's diary, and, most intriguing of
all, ``What Makes Tina Turner Tremble?''
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 more things to look for in the premiere issue:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Book That Changed Oprah's Life: Oprah so loved ``The Four
Agreements'' by Don Miguel Ruiz that she bought 410 copies, passing
them out to befuddled brethren everywhere. The pop-psychology opus
presents deals you make with yourself to ``clarify'' your life,
including the pact that packed the most punch for Winfrey: ``Don't
take anything personally.'' The article ends with ``A Gift From O''
_ five colorful bookmarks you can tear out and use in your own
favorite works.
</P>
<P>
   _ 27 Ways to Get the Most Out of Sundays: Another Oprah-penned
piece, this one shows you how to ``create your own rituals of
reverence, harmony and sharing.'' Way No. 1: ``Loll Around: Wear
your most comfortable pajamas all day.'' Yikes! That's one tip most
of us don't need, but hey, there are 26 more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poems! Alice Walker contributes a couple of free-verse gems to
accompany a photo spread on flowers. Pretty _ and pretty doggone
literary for a magazine spun off a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Personal Courage Calendar: Eeeeww! This two-page touchy-feely
spread offers inspiration and then some for folks who are feeling
feeble. Day 1: Buy a notebook to use as your Courage Journal. Write
down ``every brave, strong, surprising thing you've ever done.''
Other days include quotes to help process your feelings or specific
questions to address in the journal: ``Ask yourself, What was I
created to do?''
</P>

THE 3-MINUTE EGG AND I: WHY'S IT SO HARD TO ONE THAT'S COOKED
RIGHT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a simple enough request. A 3-minute egg for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Served in an egg cup. Maybe atop a paper doily. Perhaps soldiers
_ fingers of soft toast _ on the side.
</P>
<P>
   But no _ a journey through breakfasts in Tarrant County, Texas,
left me wondering about the fate of this simple culinary classic.
</P>
<P>
   First stop was at the beloved Ol' South Pancake House, the
24-hour kitsch cathedral to ham and eggs and all things breakfast.
No _ the eggs served up were peeled, shiny orbs of soft-boiled
eggs, the whites firm and the yolks nearly set.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, down the street, I ordered the same at
Denny's. The eggs were better this time _ served with shell intact,
the yolk was closer to the luscious, spoon-coating consistency of
memories. But sadly, the three eggs arrived in a cereal bowl,
leaving the diner to hold the shell with one hand and scoop out the
egg with a spoon in the other. Hardly genteel.
</P>
<P>
   Finally we tried the International House of Pancakes, a
dependable haunt since college days. Again, what was served were
three in-shell eggs nestled into a small bowl. And the yolks were
firm _ hardly the scoopable golden honey of a three-minute egg.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to this little bibelot of a breakfast, a
ceremony of manners that calls for a quick, but firm, thunk of a
knife blade against the shell to render it decapitated?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' says John Clark, restaurant consultant and co-author
of the new ``Country Egg, City Egg,'' ``people don't serve those.
Americans don't seem to cotton to an egg that's runny _ the
salmonella scare and all that. As a kid, I remember eating them in
a hotel. Now I think they're seen as old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``No restaurant I've ever worked for would have been equipped to
serve them, either,'' Clark says. ``They wouldn't have the egg
cups, for one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, neither will young couples who are now setting
up households.
</P>
<P>
   Brides registering their china patterns at Neiman Marcus Ridgmar
are not including egg cups in their wish lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a bride order an egg cup,'' says Georgianna
Kiker, assistant to the manager of Gift Galleries at Neiman March
Ridgmar. ``Most of the manufacturers don't even make one. If any
company is going to offer an egg cup, it's going to be an older
pattern, and you'd have to look far and wide to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Simmons, author of the hot-off-the-press ``The Good Egg:
More than 200 Fresh Approaches From Soup to Dessert'' (Houghton
Mifflin, $26), is also sentimental about the disappearance of the
elegant 3-minute egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my major food memories is lingering over a soft-cooked
egg, with little soldiers next to it, on a Saturday morning,''
Simmons says. ``There was no school bus to run for, and I would
daydream over my breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that we've had two generations now who
have been scared of eggs. To be extreme, we've thought that if we
ate an egg, we could die _ the cholesterol thing and then the
bacteria scares.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the science is that if a raw egg is cooked at 145 degrees
for three minutes,'' Simmons explains, ``any bacteria is destroyed.
Now what we've got to hope is that this nostalgic thing will come
around again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also in the age of instant breakfast, where even a
three-minute egg takes too long to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman's Kiker agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have leisurely breakfast anymore. It seems everyone
wants to drive-through McDonald's or Jack in the Box. It's like
breakfast has to be between two pieces of bread,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not for us. Because they can't be found in restaurants, here's
our version of 3-minute eggs, perfect for any morning, including
Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3-MINUTE EGG
</P>
<P>
   1 egg Enough water to cover the egg, plus 1 inch more
</P>
<P>
   Bring water to a simmer. Lower the egg into the water (this can
be done by putting the egg in a strainer and placing the strainer
in the water). As soon as the water returns to a simmer, time it
for 3 minutes. Remove by lifting strainer from the water. Using a
dish towel, place egg in egg cup, fat side down, and serve.

COMPUTER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online Scents, Speed and Cleaner Windows
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to transmit smell over the Internet? That
could be used to sell perfume or advertise a restaurant's cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although the notion of sending digitized scents from computer
to computer may have seemed a bizarre notion just a few years ago,
several companies are working to create hardware and software for
just that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware component usually uses a cartridge containing
chemicals that can simulate certain smells when they are mixed.
Codes in the scent software tell the hardware what scent to
manufacture. In an odor-enabled system, you could send a greeting
card to your significant other by e-mail and attach the smell of
roses to the card.
</P>
<P>
   A company called DigiScents (www.digiscents.com) has developed a
technology called iSmell that can be used to provide distinctive
scents that can be attached to e-mail, text and interactive
material on Web pages and interactive video games. The iSmell
hardware device attaches to the computer like a printer or any
other external device, but it generates scents instead of
printouts. DigiScents is also the home of the Snortal, a soon-to-be
Web portal that promises to offer an interactive smelling
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are developing scent-sending technologies. One
company, AromaJet.com, is working with video game companies to add
smell as a sensory component to gaming (www.aromajet.com). Another
company, TriSenx, has said that it expects to ship its own
scent-producing hardware later this month (www.trisenx.com). The
hardware, called FirstSENX, will cost about $400 and will allow
users to print scent sheets on cards and even taste the digital
concoctions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small monitor and the Windows 98 Taskbar takes up
too much room on my screen. Is there a way to get rid of it when
I'm not using it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Windows 98 has a built-in feature that will hide the Taskbar
unless you move your mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen to
make it reappear. To set up this function, go to the Start menu and
select Settings and then Taskbar and Start Menu. When you see a box
called Taskbar Properties, click on the Auto Hide check box and
then click OK When you click on the computer's desktop area, the
Taskbar should disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Personal computers keep getting faster, but how can I tell
how much speed I need? Is there really that much difference between
a 500-megahertz machine and an 800-MHz one?
</P>
<P>
   A. The speed in megahertz refers to the computer's processor,
and the bigger the number, the faster (in theory) the computer, in
terms of how quickly it can perform the tasks you tell it to. If
you want to know how much computing power you really need, you need
to ask yourself what you will be using the computer for.
</P>
<P>
   In general, faster chip speeds are better if you plan to use the
computer for things like animation-intensive videogames, digital
video production or image-editing and illustration programs. If you
just want to do common home-computing activities like Web surfing,
e-mail, word processing and spreadsheets, you will probably be
happy with a lower- to mid-range computer in terms of both price
and speed. The basic software requirements and video-processing
needs for those types of tasks usually need fewer megahertz than
graphics-oriented programs.
</P>
<P>
   The CNet Web site (computers.cnet.com) keeps a variety of
hardware reviews and comparisons that might give you a better idea
of what you need. If there are certain programs you know you will
want to run on your new computer, check each program's requirements
(always printed on the outside of the box, in catalogs and often on
the manufacturer's Web site), to make sure that the hardware you
are considering can handle it.

 (STORY SUMMARY: Most 401(k) retirement plans ask employees to
manage their own investments. One man has an easier, cheaper _ and
more lucrative _ way.)     
 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooks Hamilton doesn't look like a revolutionary. For one
thing, he is a benefits attorney and 401(k) plan record keeper.
People in these vocations are better known for emptying rooms than
for filling them.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Hamilton wears pinstriped suits, at least
when he's being lawyerly. But when he puts on sweats and settles in
front of one of his computers, Hamilton becomes a dangerous threat
to the established order.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton, in a September 1998 ``Worth'' article on 401(k)
plans, who introduced the idea of ``yield disparity'' _ the
performance chasm that separates the top 20 percent of 401(k) plans
participants from the bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton who calculated that the top 20 percent would
retire with more than 100 percent of their preretirement income
while the bottom 20 percent would retire to a diet of cat food.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hamilton says he has found a way to close the yield gap. He
proposes to turn the 401(k) from a retirement plan dependent on
costly retail mutual funds into one that relies on low-cost
wholesale pension management.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton calls his solution the Freedom Plan. If it works the
way he says it will, the Freedom Plan could siphon much of the $593
billion in 401(k) assets now held in retail mutual funds into
managed pension accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero for the Freedom Plan revolution is Safelite, a
privately-held company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. With $877
million in annual sales, Safelite is the largest manufacturer and
installer of auto replacement glass in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It has 600 service centers in all corners of the U.S., 3,200
vans, 80 warehouses, two manufacturing plants, and 6,300 employees.
If you've ever had a broken windshield replaced, there's a good
chance you've done business with Safelite.
</P>
<P>
   Safelite management had for years struggled to spread the word
about the company's 401(k) benefit to its widely scattered, mostly
blue-collar work force. But as recently as 1994, the Safelite
401(k) was stumbling along with a 38 percent participation rate,
about half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as bad, the average contribution of those who did
participate was a meager 2.3 percent of pay, also less than half
that in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Safelite CFO Douglas Herron asked Hamilton how the
company could improve its plan. Hamilton had a few ideas.
</P>
<P>
   To spur participation, Safelite started automatically enrolling
new employees in the plan unless they specifically opted out of it.
And to reward job longevity, the company started matching 20
percent of an employee's contribution in the first two years of his
or her service, escalating to 40 percent after five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to encourage a long career at Safelite,'' says
Herron. And Safelite agreed to increase its match rate when overall
participation in the plan reached specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   When the participation rate was at 50 percent, for instance,
Safelite would increase its match by 10 percent. When the
participation rate hit 60 percent, the match would grow by 25
percent. When the participation rate exceeded 75 percent, the
company match would rise by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These incentives, Hamilton figured, would turn veteran Safelite
employees into plan evangelists, boosting participation and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, all employees were mailed
personalized projections that showed how increases in contributions
would affect their retirement. The goal was to have employees
contribute enough to capture at least 90 percent of the potential
company match.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's final suggestion was the really radical one. Instead
of offering a wider range of investment choices or even a
self-directed brokerage account, as some plans do, Hamilton wanted
the company to float a new option called PDI, for Professionally
Directed Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who selected the PDI option would have their money
invested by the same professional managers who were handling
Safelite's defined-benefits pension. This would lower the cost of
operating the plan and, very likely, increase the investment return
of the money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical 401(k) plan, the money is managed by amateurs,''
says Hamilton. ``With PDI it's invested by pros.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist on accepted convention, Hamilton made PDI the
default option for positive enrollment. (Most plans make a money
market fund, perhaps the world's least appropriate retirement
investment, their default choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless a new employee specified otherwise, his or her money
would go into PDI. To Hamilton, making PDI the default option was
crucial, because it meant that even the most financially illiterate
Safelite employee would have a well-designed investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Many 401(k) savers have no such assurance. Investing may seem
like the new national pastime, but the reality is that to many
people, portfolio management is a mystery they have no interest in
solving. They spread their retirement savings across the choices
they are offered rather than making choices appropriate to their
age. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One landmark study, by UCLA business school professor Shlomo
Benartzi and University of Chicago behavioral finance expert
Richard Thaler, found that the investment choices made by 401(k)
savers tend to reflect the number of options in the plan and its
implicit asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in a plan that offers more bond funds than
equity funds, participants tend to have low equity commitments.
Participants in a plan that offers more equity funds than bond
funds tend to have a higher equity commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TWA's plan, according to the study, offers five
stock funds and one bond fund. Participants in TWA's plan have a 75
percent equity allocation. The University of California plan offers
four bond funds and one stock fund. In that plan, participants have
a 34 percent equity allocation. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safelite added PDI to its plan in January 1999. By Jan. 1, 2000,
Hamilton says, the participation rate had reached 73 percent and
the average contribution had hit 4.2 percent of pay. That enabled
employees to capture 75 percent of the potential match money.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an ordinary level of employee turnover, Hamilton is
confident that Safelite will reach 90 percent participation by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of PDI on Safelite employees' retirement prospects is
dramatic. Hamilton estimates that the typical employee will see his
or her probable retirement income rise from only 14 percent of
final salary to 50 percent. Add Social Security benefits, and most
employees will approach 100 percent of final pay.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the joy of having choices? What about the subtle
pleasures of deciding between the growth of the Pacific Rim, the
security of real estate, and the undervaluation of small-company
stocks?
</P>
<P>
   If Safelite is any indication, most people won't miss the extra
options. Safelite's new plan-eligible employees in January still
had six mutual funds from which to choose, but only 5.9 percent
opted out of PDI.
</P>
<P>
   That means traditional mutual funds are missing 94.1 percent of
this year's new money. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

 SMART TOOLS FOR THE HOME WITH CHIPS, LASERS, LCDs  
 (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Great Pyramids and the Taj Mahal were built with stupid
tools. The pictures in the Metropolitan Museum and the Louvre were
hung with stupid tools. Thomas Jefferson, a smart man, built
Monticello with stupid tools that did not contain a single
microchip, laser, diode, liquid crystal display or ultrasonic
transducer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not trying to build Monticello. I'm just trying to do some
simple remodeling and repair work around the house. If a smart tool
helps me do a better job, it would be dumb not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   I've been testing several IntelliTools from the Stanley Works,
makers of the Stanley brand of hand tools, including a digital tape
measure that uses optical sensors and a display screen, a digital
stud finder that is smart enough to look behind walls and tell the
difference between wood, pipes and electrical live wiring, an
ultrasonic measuring estimator with a laser pointer and a digital
level with a laser that can switch from a dot to a crosshair.
</P>
<P>
   None of these tools is going to replace its old-fashioned
counterpart in my toolbox, at least not yet. However, each of the
IntelliTools has a trick or two that comes in handy for certain
tasks under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Gadget fans will add one or more of these smart tools to their
toolboxes just because they are gadgets, and therefore cool. Tool
fans will buy them because they love tools. ``Any excuse to buy a
tool is a good excuse,'' noted Rick Schwolsky, chief editor of
Hanley-Wood's Tools of the Trade, (www.toolsofthetrade.net) a tool
magazine for professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, anyone who pays more than $100 for a laser torpedo
level just to hang a towel rack is probably half a bubble off
center himself. A simple, brainless spirit level works just fine
and is a lot cheaper. But if you do a lot of handyman (or
handywoman) chores, perhaps one of these tools makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   I've become especially enamored of the Stanley 77-007
IntelliMeasure Ultrasonic Estimator with Laser Pointer ($66.21 at
www.kenstool.com, or $80 at www.amazon.com), even though it is not
as accurate as a tape measure. The estimator, which looks like the
love child of the Star Wars robot R2-D2 and a beer can, uses sound
waves to measure distances up to 50 feet and is accurate to within
half a percent. That is, it may be off by as much as three inches
at 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want to use it to measure cuts for a marble
countertop,'' said David Wakefield, an engineer for Stanley's
IntelliTools line. But for doing a quick estimate of a room size
for carpeting, or when you're trying to figure out if your bed is
going to fit in what some Manhattan landlords charmingly refer to
as ``the second bedroom'' (didn't this used to be a closet?), it
comes close enough. The display can be set for feet and inches,
decimal feet or metric units.
</P>
<P>
   After measuring the length width and height of a room (measuring
ceiling height without a ladder is one of the nicest features), the
estimator can also calculate the area and volume of a room with the
push of the button. The estimator has to be held perpendicular to
the wall or surface being measured, or it gets confused. When I
bounced an oblique scan at a wall no more than 5 feet from me, it
sent back the startling news that the wall was 45 feet 11 inches
away, indicating that ultrasound waves were ricocheting around the
room.
</P>
<P>
   It won my heart, however, when I had to measure a long hallway
that had become soaked after a spectacularly unfortunate plumbing
problem. There are some places you don't want to go with a tape
measure.
</P>
<P>
   For places you do want to go with a tape measure, there is the
Stanley IntelliTape 25-foot digital tape measure ($40). It combines
a traditional steel tape measure with optical sensors and a liquid
crystal display.
</P>
<P>
   Optical sensors inside the measure keep track of tiny holes in
the tape itself and calculate the distance based on how many holes
are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Distances are displayed on the small screen in your choice of
units: inches, feet and inches, centimeters, or decimal meters. The
IntelliTape uses a chip to store the distance in case I can't
immediately find a pencil to write it down.
</P>
<P>
   Zircon (www.zircon.com), which competes with Stanley in the
smart tools for consumers market, has a 25-foot tape measure called
The Repeater ($30), which comes with a built-in, 20-second voice
recorder. It seems more useful for recording job-related to-do
lists rather than tape measurements.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley IntelliTape is somewhat heavy and clunky, and it was
difficult to unscrew the case to insert the three button-style
batteries. But it had some features I liked a lot, like a button
that instantly calculates the midpoint of any measurement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, I was trying to center a picture on a wall that was
415 16 inches wide. I could have done the math, but it was easier
to push the ``mid'' button, and bingo: 2011 16 . Here at the Close
Enough Construction Co., we don't quibble over a measly 32nd of an
inch.
</P>
<P>
   Once I had measured the wall, I wanted to make sure that I
didn't add to my excitement by pounding a nail into a hidden pipe
or a live electrical wire. Enter the Stanley IntelliSensor DigiScan
stud sensor (about $40), which is the next-best thing to X-ray
vision, at least when it comes to looking through drywall.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned magnetic stud finders work by sensing the nails in
wooden studs behind the wall. They work well for simple tasks like
hanging a picture, but for more elaborate tasks, like installing a
recessed bookshelf, it is often necessary to know the exact
location of studs and joists, live electrical wires and plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   As it is moved slowly across a wall or floor, the IntelliSensor
DigiScan sends out an electromagnetic field that detects hidden
wood, metal and live wiring. Be careful, however, because live
current might not be detected in shielded wires or live wires
inside a metal casing. The display screen shows the proximity of
the material on a bar graph, and the type of material as simple
icons (a tree for wood, a lightning bolt for live wires, and so
on). If it detects both metal and wood, like a nail in a stud, it
shows both icons.
</P>
<P>
   The IntelliSensor can penetrate standard three-quarters-inch
drywall with ease, and in ``deep read,'' according to Stanley, it
can detect pipes up to three inches deep in concrete. In my tests,
it pinpointed the exact edges and centers of hidden studs. It also
chirps excitedly when it finds something, as when I accidentally
held it against my laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The most dispiriting tool of the four I tried was the
IntelliPoint Plus laser torpedo level (about $115), because it
largely confirmed my hunch that my house had no right angles or
level surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The IntelliPoint Plus is a conventional nine-inch, three-bubble
torpedo level with an adjustable vial (for measuring angles) and a
built-in laser pointer. The laser is accurate to about 100 feet and
is set exactly one inch above the level's base plate. A small lens
can be switched to focus the beam into a dot or a cross-hair
pattern, which is handy for laying out grids for tile, for example.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few examples of new smart tools, and others are
undoubtedly on the drawing board. As the price of electronic
components falls, so will the price of smart tools. If smart tools
become popular, that could distress purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is beauty in the tradition and legacy that follows these
tools through evolution,'' Schwolsky said. ``Part of that tradition
is learning how to use the tool, and knowing each tool's quirks.
There is something lost in the relationship between craftsman and
tool when the tool becomes smarter than the user.''

 (STORY SUMMARY: Most 401(k) retirement plans ask employees to
manage their own investments. One man has an easier, cheaper _ and
more lucrative _ way.)     
 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooks Hamilton doesn't look like a revolutionary. For one
thing, he is a benefits attorney and 401(k) plan record keeper.
People in these vocations are better known for emptying rooms than
for filling them.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Hamilton wears pinstriped suits, at least
when he's being lawyerly. But when he puts on sweats and settles in
front of one of his computers, Hamilton becomes a dangerous threat
to the established order.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton, in a September 1998 ``Worth'' article on 401(k)
plans, who introduced the idea of ``yield disparity'' _ the
performance chasm that separates the top 20 percent of 401(k) plans
participants from the bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton who calculated that the top 20 percent would
retire with more than 100 percent of their preretirement income
while the bottom 20 percent would retire to a diet of cat food.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hamilton says he has found a way to close the yield gap. He
proposes to turn the 401(k) from a retirement plan dependent on
costly retail mutual funds into one that relies on low-cost
wholesale pension management.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton calls his solution the Freedom Plan. If it works the
way he says it will, the Freedom Plan could siphon much of the $593
billion in 401(k) assets now held in retail mutual funds into
managed pension accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero for the Freedom Plan revolution is Safelite, a
privately-held company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. With $877
million in annual sales, Safelite is the largest manufacturer and
installer of auto replacement glass in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It has 600 service centers in all corners of the U.S., 3,200
vans, 80 warehouses, two manufacturing plants, and 6,300 employees.
If you've ever had a broken windshield replaced, there's a good
chance you've done business with Safelite.
</P>
<P>
   Safelite management had for years struggled to spread the word
about the company's 401(k) benefit to its widely scattered, mostly
blue-collar work force. But as recently as 1994, the Safelite
401(k) was stumbling along with a 38 percent participation rate,
about half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as bad, the average contribution of those who did
participate was a meager 2.3 percent of pay, also less than half
that in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Safelite CFO Douglas Herron asked Hamilton how the
company could improve its plan. Hamilton had a few ideas.
</P>
<P>
   To spur participation, Safelite started automatically enrolling
new employees in the plan unless they specifically opted out of it.
And to reward job longevity, the company started matching 20
percent of an employee's contribution in the first two years of his
or her service, escalating to 40 percent after five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to encourage a long career at Safelite,'' says
Herron. And Safelite agreed to increase its match rate when overall
participation in the plan reached specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   When the participation rate was at 50 percent, for instance,
Safelite would increase its match by 10 percent. When the
participation rate hit 60 percent, the match would grow by 25
percent. When the participation rate exceeded 75 percent, the
company match would rise by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These incentives, Hamilton figured, would turn veteran Safelite
employees into plan evangelists, boosting participation and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, all employees were mailed
personalized projections that showed how increases in contributions
would affect their retirement. The goal was to have employees
contribute enough to capture at least 90 percent of the potential
company match.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's final suggestion was the really radical one. Instead
of offering a wider range of investment choices or even a
self-directed brokerage account, as some plans do, Hamilton wanted
the company to float a new option called PDI, for Professionally
Directed Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who selected the PDI option would have their money
invested by the same professional managers who were handling
Safelite's defined-benefits pension. This would lower the cost of
operating the plan and, very likely, increase the investment return
of the money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical 401(k) plan, the money is managed by amateurs,''
says Hamilton. ``With PDI it's invested by pros.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist on accepted convention, Hamilton made PDI the
default option for positive enrollment. (Most plans make a money
market fund, perhaps the world's least appropriate retirement
investment, their default choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless a new employee specified otherwise, his or her money
would go into PDI. To Hamilton, making PDI the default option was
crucial, because it meant that even the most financially illiterate
Safelite employee would have a well-designed investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Many 401(k) savers have no such assurance. Investing may seem
like the new national pastime, but the reality is that to many
people, portfolio management is a mystery they have no interest in
solving. They spread their retirement savings across the choices
they are offered rather than making choices appropriate to their
age. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One landmark study, by UCLA business school professor Shlomo
Benartzi and University of Chicago behavioral finance expert
Richard Thaler, found that the investment choices made by 401(k)
savers tend to reflect the number of options in the plan and its
implicit asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in a plan that offers more bond funds than
equity funds, participants tend to have low equity commitments.
Participants in a plan that offers more equity funds than bond
funds tend to have a higher equity commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TWA's plan, according to the study, offers five
stock funds and one bond fund. Participants in TWA's plan have a 75
percent equity allocation. The University of California plan offers
four bond funds and one stock fund. In that plan, participants have
a 34 percent equity allocation. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safelite added PDI to its plan in January 1999. By Jan. 1, 2000,
Hamilton says, the participation rate had reached 73 percent and
the average contribution had hit 4.2 percent of pay. That enabled
employees to capture 75 percent of the potential match money.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an ordinary level of employee turnover, Hamilton is
confident that Safelite will reach 90 percent participation by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of PDI on Safelite employees' retirement prospects is
dramatic. Hamilton estimates that the typical employee will see his
or her probable retirement income rise from only 14 percent of
final salary to 50 percent. Add Social Security benefits, and most
employees will approach 100 percent of final pay.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the joy of having choices? What about the subtle
pleasures of deciding between the growth of the Pacific Rim, the
security of real estate, and the undervaluation of small-company
stocks?
</P>
<P>
   If Safelite is any indication, most people won't miss the extra
options. Safelite's new plan-eligible employees in January still
had six mutual funds from which to choose, but only 5.9 percent
opted out of PDI.
</P>
<P>
   That means traditional mutual funds are missing 94.1 percent of
this year's new money. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

 (STORY SUMMARY: Most 401(k) retirement plans ask employees to
manage their own investments. One man has an easier, cheaper _ and
more lucrative _ way.)     
 By SCOTT BURNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooks Hamilton doesn't look like a revolutionary. For one
thing, he is a benefits attorney and 401(k) plan record keeper.
People in these vocations are better known for emptying rooms than
for filling them.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Hamilton wears pinstriped suits, at least
when he's being lawyerly. But when he puts on sweats and settles in
front of one of his computers, Hamilton becomes a dangerous threat
to the established order.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton, in a September 1998 ``Worth'' article on 401(k)
plans, who introduced the idea of ``yield disparity'' _ the
performance chasm that separates the top 20 percent of 401(k) plans
participants from the bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamilton who calculated that the top 20 percent would
retire with more than 100 percent of their preretirement income
while the bottom 20 percent would retire to a diet of cat food.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hamilton says he has found a way to close the yield gap. He
proposes to turn the 401(k) from a retirement plan dependent on
costly retail mutual funds into one that relies on low-cost
wholesale pension management.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton calls his solution the Freedom Plan. If it works the
way he says it will, the Freedom Plan could siphon much of the $593
billion in 401(k) assets now held in retail mutual funds into
managed pension accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero for the Freedom Plan revolution is Safelite, a
privately-held company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. With $877
million in annual sales, Safelite is the largest manufacturer and
installer of auto replacement glass in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It has 600 service centers in all corners of the U.S., 3,200
vans, 80 warehouses, two manufacturing plants, and 6,300 employees.
If you've ever had a broken windshield replaced, there's a good
chance you've done business with Safelite.
</P>
<P>
   Safelite management had for years struggled to spread the word
about the company's 401(k) benefit to its widely scattered, mostly
blue-collar work force. But as recently as 1994, the Safelite
401(k) was stumbling along with a 38 percent participation rate,
about half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as bad, the average contribution of those who did
participate was a meager 2.3 percent of pay, also less than half
that in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Safelite CFO Douglas Herron asked Hamilton how the
company could improve its plan. Hamilton had a few ideas.
</P>
<P>
   To spur participation, Safelite started automatically enrolling
new employees in the plan unless they specifically opted out of it.
And to reward job longevity, the company started matching 20
percent of an employee's contribution in the first two years of his
or her service, escalating to 40 percent after five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to encourage a long career at Safelite,'' says
Herron. And Safelite agreed to increase its match rate when overall
participation in the plan reached specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   When the participation rate was at 50 percent, for instance,
Safelite would increase its match by 10 percent. When the
participation rate hit 60 percent, the match would grow by 25
percent. When the participation rate exceeded 75 percent, the
company match would rise by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These incentives, Hamilton figured, would turn veteran Safelite
employees into plan evangelists, boosting participation and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, all employees were mailed
personalized projections that showed how increases in contributions
would affect their retirement. The goal was to have employees
contribute enough to capture at least 90 percent of the potential
company match.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's final suggestion was the really radical one. Instead
of offering a wider range of investment choices or even a
self-directed brokerage account, as some plans do, Hamilton wanted
the company to float a new option called PDI, for Professionally
Directed Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who selected the PDI option would have their money
invested by the same professional managers who were handling
Safelite's defined-benefits pension. This would lower the cost of
operating the plan and, very likely, increase the investment return
of the money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical 401(k) plan, the money is managed by amateurs,''
says Hamilton. ``With PDI it's invested by pros.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final twist on accepted convention, Hamilton made PDI the
default option for positive enrollment. (Most plans make a money
market fund, perhaps the world's least appropriate retirement
investment, their default choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless a new employee specified otherwise, his or her money
would go into PDI. To Hamilton, making PDI the default option was
crucial, because it meant that even the most financially illiterate
Safelite employee would have a well-designed investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Many 401(k) savers have no such assurance. Investing may seem
like the new national pastime, but the reality is that to many
people, portfolio management is a mystery they have no interest in
solving. They spread their retirement savings across the choices
they are offered rather than making choices appropriate to their
age. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One landmark study, by UCLA business school professor Shlomo
Benartzi and University of Chicago behavioral finance expert
Richard Thaler, found that the investment choices made by 401(k)
savers tend to reflect the number of options in the plan and its
implicit asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in a plan that offers more bond funds than
equity funds, participants tend to have low equity commitments.
Participants in a plan that offers more equity funds than bond
funds tend to have a higher equity commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TWA's plan, according to the study, offers five
stock funds and one bond fund. Participants in TWA's plan have a 75
percent equity allocation. The University of California plan offers
four bond funds and one stock fund. In that plan, participants have
a 34 percent equity allocation. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safelite added PDI to its plan in January 1999. By Jan. 1, 2000,
Hamilton says, the participation rate had reached 73 percent and
the average contribution had hit 4.2 percent of pay. That enabled
employees to capture 75 percent of the potential match money.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an ordinary level of employee turnover, Hamilton is
confident that Safelite will reach 90 percent participation by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of PDI on Safelite employees' retirement prospects is
dramatic. Hamilton estimates that the typical employee will see his
or her probable retirement income rise from only 14 percent of
final salary to 50 percent. Add Social Security benefits, and most
employees will approach 100 percent of final pay.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the joy of having choices? What about the subtle
pleasures of deciding between the growth of the Pacific Rim, the
security of real estate, and the undervaluation of small-company
stocks?
</P>
<P>
   If Safelite is any indication, most people won't miss the extra
options. Safelite's new plan-eligible employees in January still
had six mutual funds from which to choose, but only 5.9 percent
opted out of PDI.
</P>
<P>
   That means traditional mutual funds are missing 94.1 percent of
this year's new money. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Mary Nolan, a freshman at Mount St. Mary College in Newburgh,
N.Y., was hanging out in her cramped dormitory room on a recent
Wednesday, typing intently on her laptop. She was exchanging
instant messages with an online buddy in Chicago when the phone
rang. The caller was a friend down the hall, asking Nolan to come
by and talk.
</P>
<P>
   In most places, Nolan would have had to make a choice: She could
quit her online chat or tell her friend she would visit later. But
on this tiny campus, just west of the Hudson River, Nolan did not
even think about choosing her friend over her laptop. ``I just took
it with me down the hall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked, the computer was still on, her Internet
connection was still intact, and messages from her online buddy
continued to appear. When she reached her friend's room, she sat on
a couch, put the computer on a table and resumed her two
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount St. Mary, portable communications are common. Nearly
four years ago, the college installed a high-speed wireless network
that covers the campus, including parking lots, dormitories and
everything between. Every faculty member and nearly 100 students
have laptops equipped with transceivers and antennas to pick up and
transfer Internet signals. Most students in the dormitories also
have wireless access through their desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Nolan goes with her laptop _ whether it is the library,
the cafeteria or the lawn outside her dormitory _ the Internet
follows her.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, experts in wireless technology say,
people throughout the world will be tapping into similar local
wireless networks at work, at home and even in public places like
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has made the access speeds for these networks far
faster than the connections used by people with wireless modems for
Internet service. And compared with the limited Web access that
comes with today's fancy cell phones, local networks allow people
to use the full power of their laptops to download files, design
Web pages and listen to MP3 files without ever having to plug in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a manifestation of a larger shift,'' said Brian Cotton,
director of consulting for Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a technology
consulting company. Before wireless networking evolved, he said,
``people would go  &UR; to &LR;  information,'' whether they walked to the
library or sat down at an Internet-connected computer. Now the same
information can come to them, as long as they are within range of a
wireless network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mount St. Mary, a liberal arts college with about 2,000
students, is one of several colleges leading the way. Its
experience provides a glimpse of a future in which online access is
literally everywhere, all the time. Being wirelessly connected,
students and professors say, has turned the Internet into a fluid
and almost invisible part of their day-to-day work. They have
developed an automatic reflex to go to the Web for information, no
matter where they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You forget that you don't have the wireless capability at
home,'' said Dr. Tom Sarro, a biology professor. ``I'll be in my
living room with the laptop and I'll say, I need an image of
this.'' He will pull up his Web browser to do a search and a
message will appear on the screen telling him he has no Internet
connection. ``Then it's, Oh, I forgot,'' he said. ``I have to go
downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk around the campus and the implications of the wireless
network become apparent. In the library one afternoon, a woman was
walking toward the stairwell holding her laptop as if it were a
serving tray. A mouse attached to the laptop had been placed on the
keyboard to keep it from dangling as she walked. The lid was
half-closed.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a librarian named Sherly Fang, explained that she did
not want to close the lid completely because that would put the
computer into standby mode, interrupting her work. She was updating
a library Web page and was about to start her shift on the
reference desk, where she would continue to work on the Web site.
``It's quite convenient,'' she said before heading up the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Fang's laptop-carrying method, it turns out, is standard
throughout the library. People move from desks to the stacks with
their laptops half open, like oversize clamshells. Nolan, the
freshman who was sending messages to her friend in Chicago, said
she had perfected another technique: ``I can hold the laptop in one
arm and type with the other hand as I walk down the hall,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   If people are not on the move with their Internet connections,
they are often using them in unusual locations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Geisler, a media studies professor, said he kept his
laptop in his car and pulled up Web sites as he sat in the parking
lot, doing some last-minute preparation for class lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Malecki, a freshman who plays on the women's basketball
team, said she did research on the Internet while reclining on her
bed, sitting on the dormitory's front stoop or hanging out with her
boyfriend in the lounge. Last fall, when she could not play because
of an injury, she browsed the library's online catalog from the gym
while her teammates practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Some students say the wireless network has helped avoid
conflicts with roommates. Daphne David, a premed student, was
checking e-mail messages and working on a chemistry assignment one
night when her roommate decided that it was time for bed. ``To not
disturb her, I took my laptop to the lounge and was still
connected,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   The more students talk about the network, the more it sounds
like a luxury. But at Mount St. Mary, a little-known college where
lawns are rimmed with mud and elevators creak with age, technicians
installed the network as a way to save money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when most colleges were wiring every room in every
residential hall so students could have broadband access to the
Internet, administrators at Mount St. Mary were trying to figure
out how they could afford to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The computer laboratories and offices were already wired for
high-speed access, but the dormitory rooms and classrooms were not.
John Bucek, the college's executive director of information
technologies, found that the price tag would be as much as
$150,000, not including labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to pay that price,'' Bucek said.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, he read an article on wireless technology.
The estimated cost to put in a network that would cover the area
needed for the dormitories at Mount St. Mary's was $10,000 to
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw that, I said, `Wow, we have to look into
this,''' Bucek said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as some analysts have talked about how wireless technology
might let developing countries skip the costs of building a wired
infrastructure, Bucek wondered if Mount St. Mary could skip the
wiring stage, at least in its dormitories. Several other colleges,
including Cornell University and Johns Hopkins University, have
since tried the same thing in some classrooms. And Carnegie Mellon
University has recently installed a wireless network to supplement
its wired one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Campuses usually lend themselves to these networks because they
are self-contained, technology managers say. Campus populations are
relatively constant, so administrators can predict how many people
need access, send out memorandums to users and set up systems for
technical support. For the same reasons, some retail companies,
like rental car agencies, have already adopted the technology. Now
corporate offices and medical centers have also started to embrace
the notion of being unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   To get started at Mount St. Mary, Bucek approached Proxim, a
wireless network company, and persuaded the company to consider
Mount St. Mary as a test. He also asked the company to provide
discounts for the wireless adapter cards that the students could
install in their computers. The company eventually agreed to lease
the cards, which include tiny antennas, for $45 a semester or $95 a
year. Typically, such cards cost at least $400 each.
</P>
<P>
   Bucek and his technology team also decided to lease laptops for
every professor and librarian. (In a few years, he said, the laptop
computers may be required for admission so everyone will have the
same mobile communications.)
</P>
<P>
   Supplying the laptops to professors was a strategic decision,
Bucek said. With mobile access, they might be more likely to create
online syllabuses and integrate the Web into their class
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   According to many professors, the strategy worked. Sarro, the
biology professor, uses the Web in class to supplement his botany
lectures. Geisler, the media studies professor, asks his students
to review drafts of writing assignments that have been distributed
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't live without it,'' said Dr. Lucy DiPaola, an education
professor who walked out of her office carrying a laptop case. ``I
can download at any given moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the wireless adapter cards, the network consists
of access points, the industry term for book-size hubs that plug
into the college's wired network, its Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount St. Mary, cables and wires were laid to carry the
Ethernet to a few dormitories and buildings. Twenty-eight access
points were then installed at the Ethernet's endpoints, and in a
few places, extensions were added to push the wireless network's
range beyond its typical diameter, 300 feet indoors and 1,000 feet
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the system, which cost the college about $63,000, provides
Internet access at 1.6 megabits per second to more than just the
dormitory area. It covers every corner of the 41-acre campus.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is not as fast as the 10 mbps that students in
most wired dormitories have, and that has prompted a few complaints
from parents, Bucek said. But in interviews with students, none
mentioned any problems with the slower speed. And a few praised the
system as being much better than the dial-up access they have
off-campus. Soon, Bucek said, he hopes to take advantage of even
faster technology that is now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up the network did present some challenges. One was a
steel elevator shaft in a building at the top of the main hill on
campus. It blocked signals and made it difficult for people nearby
to get access. To solve the problem, Bucek added access points on
the back and front of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Interference was also a concern, especially since the wireless
system uses a frequency of 2.4 gigahertz, a part of the radio
spectrum that does not require a license from the Federal
Communications Commission. Before the network was installed, Bucek
walked around the campus with an analyzer, scouting out who else
might be using the frequency. He was relieved to find that the air
around Mount St. Mary was relatively free of intrusions _ aside
from one particular microwave oven in a faculty lounge. Bucek calls
the microwave the ``dreaded enemy of the wireless network.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Bucek and Arthur Emerson, his network
manager, showed just how far their network extends. Emerson opened
a Web browser, found a site that plays MP3 files, turned up the
volume, held the laptop upright and started to walk down the hall.
The music blared as he left the building and walked onto the
street. It became slightly weaker for a moment, as he reached the
midpoint between two buildings with access points, then blasted
through again a few steps later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a student walking around holding their laptop
out to listen to music,'' Emerson said, tuning the Internet radio
to a new station. ``But I'm sure that's not far off.''
</P>
<P>
   While students may not be depending on the system for their
music, they have already learned to appreciate Internet access that
is available anywhere, any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already asked my mom,'' David said. `` `Can we have
wireless at home?'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us who really like pizza but don't want all the fat
and calories that come along with it, the discovery of a delicious,
truly vegetarian pizza on the lower level at the newly restored
Grand Central Terminal in New York City a few weeks ago is worth
heralding.
</P>
<P>
   After sampling it twice I can now make a reasonable facsimile of
it. The secret is the sauce. Its intense savory flavors take the
place of the absent cheese in the sense that you don't miss the
rich gooeyness that it provides. Instead you have hot pepper flakes
that wake up the taste buds instantly as well as a little bit of
ground cumin and of fennel seeds that make it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing a little of the sauce with the sauteed vegetables pulls
everything together so that every bite provides a lot of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Other cheese and meatless pizzas I have had in the past did
nothing to enhance the sauce and make it interesting so that there
was some boring sauce plopped on the dough, topped with some bland
vegetables that had been only barely sauteed.
</P>
<P>
   Why not give it a try? If you don't agree you can always
sprinkle on some Parmigiano Reggiano and run the pizza under the
broiler.
</P>
<P>
   I use whole wheat tortillas as pizza dough. You can use white
flour tortillas but you will lose whatever fiber there is in the
whole wheat version.
</P>
<P>
   A simple arugula and tomato salad is tarted up with a couple of
tablespoons of the Reggiano. If you cannot find the tiny cherry
tomatoes use larger ones. Size is not critical here. When buying
out-of-season tomatoes it is critical that you buy the ones that
have stems. That distinguishes the better tomatoes from the
run-of-the-mill cherry tomatoes, which are flavorless at this time
of year.
</P>
<P>
   CAJUN VEGGIE PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups tomato puree or ground tomatoes, no salt added
</P>
<P>
   1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces whole onion or 5 ounces chopped, ready-cut (1 1/3 cups)
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces whole zucchini or 7 ounces chopped, ready-cut (1 1/3
cups)
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces whole red peppers or 11 ounces ready-cut strips (2 1/2
cups)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 9-inch whole wheat tortillas
</P>
<P>
   1. Turn oven to broil.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mince garlic. Combine with tomato puree, hot pepper flakes,
cumin and fennel in a small pot and heat to a simmer. Simmer while
preparing the rest of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   3. Chop whole onion. Heat large nonstick pan to high; reduce
heat to medium high and add oil and onion and saute until onion
begins to take on color.
</P>
<P>
   4. Wash and trim the whole zucchini and cut into small chunks.
Wash, trim and seed red peppers and cut into small strips. Add the
zucchini and peppers to the onion and continue cooking over medium
heat until vegetables soften.
</P>
<P>
   5. Meanwhile place two of the tortillas on foil on a broiler pan
and broil until hot and browning. Watch carefully because they will
brown quickly.
</P>
<P>
   6. When vegetables are cooked stir about 1/4 cup of the tomato
sauce into the vegetables. Spread one third of the remaining sauce
on each of the two toasted tortillas. Top with one third of
vegetables and serve.
</P>
<P>
   7. Repeat with remaining tortilla, sauce and vegetables; cut in
half and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1 small piece Parmigiano Reggiano to yield 2 tablespoon coarsely
grated
</P>
<P>
   1. Wash the arugula, trim tough stems and dry. Wash tomatoes,
cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whisk together oil and vinegar and mix with tomatoes and
arugula.
</P>
<P>

   For all the ensuing governmental and media hubbub, the ``denial
of service'' attacks that cut off access to some of the Web's most
popular destinations in early February affected only a very few
people.
</P>
<P>
   Even active users who were temporarily shut out of their
favorite sites _ Amazon.com, eBay, Buy.com, for example _ could
simply pick up where they left off after service was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Or most of them could, anyway. Two sites were unfortunate
exceptions: online brokerage houses E(asterisk)Trade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   DoS attacks take advantage of a weakness in the underlying
protocol on the Internet. IPv4 (for ``Internet Protocol Version
4'') is the lingua franca of the world's computers, and while the
system has worked well up to this point, it was never intended to
prevent strikes like those in February.
</P>
<P>
   There's no method for authenticating the origin of an IPv4
packet; it's possible to fake, or ``spoof,'' the source address of
a request. An attacker can send messages with a spoofed source
address through a so-called amplifier, flooding his target with
responses to messages it didn't send, slowing or stopping the
delivery of legitimate data.
</P>
<P>
   Although details remain sketchy, this is apparently what
happened in February _ major sites laid low with a simple trick,
using easily obtainable tools. And while the results were
spectacular, the technical know-how required is minimal, allowing
almost anyone to accomplish the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much additional security a site claims to have,
nothing can eliminate these DoS attacks as the Internet currently
stands.
</P>
<P>
   And that's frightening to anyone who trades online. Unlike the
other sites that were hit in the attacks, everything that happens
on E(asterisk)Trade and Datek (and on all Internet-based trading
sites for that matter) is time-critical, tied to events in the real
world. A half-hour can be a lifetime if your core holding is
tanking.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ease and anonymity of the DoS attacks that shut the
sites down, they pose a significant risk for anybody who actively
trades online, simply by closing down an investor's link to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term solution to the problem is replacing IPv4 with a
more robust protocol, and IPv6, which doesn't allow spoofed source
addresses, is the leading contender.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, making the switch from one protocol to another is
an immense task, and moving to IPv6 entirely _ thus preventing
anonymous DoS attacks _ is estimated to be a decade-long process.
</P>
<P>
   It will require replacing every piece of software on the Net,
from low-level router code and operating systems to Windows and
your Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   No one site or user can do it alone, though industry leaders
such as standards committees, network infrastructure providers, and
Microsoft could lead the push.

BRETON SEPARATISTS SUSPECTED IN BOMBING OF FRENCH MCDONALD'S  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A bomb exploded at a McDonald's restaurant in a small
city in Brittany Wednesday, killing a restaurant worker, and the
Interior Ministry suggested that it was the work of an obscure
Breton separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   A second bomb found outside a post office in Rennes, 35 miles
away, was defused.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Dinan went off at about 10 a.m. near the
restaurant's drive-through window. The force of the explosion
hurled the body of Laurence Turbec, 28, into shrubbery near the
parking lot. Few customers were in the restaurant at the time.
</P>
<P>
   No one took responsibility for either bomb, but the police said
three sticks of dynamite found in Rennes were from a cache of eight
tons stolen at gunpoint from an industrial depot last September.
The police eventually recovered five tons and arrested on robbery
charges members of the small Brittany Combat Group and the
better-known Basque separatist movement ETA.
</P>
<P>
   Another Breton separatist group, the Revolutionary Breton Army,
has long been suspected of links with Basque and Corsican
separatists as well as the Irish Republican Army. It has a history
of bombings in the region, which have surged in the months since
the theft. The robbers also took miles of detonating cord and
thousands of detonators. The Revolutionary Breton Army has claimed
responsibility for four recent bombings. But previous attacks have
been on government buildings, electrical pylons or other property
and have killed no one.
</P>
<P>
   Such acts ``never before had such dramatic consequences,'' said
a statement from the Interior Ministry, which sent an antiterrorism
unit to investigate. ``Their authors don't hesitate to put human
life in danger, and they should be forcefully condemned.''
</P>
<P>
   In an event that may not be connected, three bullets were fired
at the same restaurant a month ago, the mayor of Dinan said
Wednesday. The incident remains unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday why a McDonald's was targeted. It is
hardly a symbol of the French state. As a symbol of America, the
restaurants in France have been attacked by farmers protesting
globalization and U.S. sanctions on French foods. But Jose Bove,
leader of the Confederation Paysanne farmers union, condemned
Wednesday's attack ``in the strongest possible way,'' saying his
organization conducts its protests openly and without injuring any
people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brittany, in northwest France, historically has its own Celtic
language and was an independent dukedom for centuries until 1491,
when its ruling Duchess Anne married Charles VIII, setting the
stage for annexation in 1532 when their daughter, Claude, became
Queen of France. Its provincial autonomy was further usurped during
the Terror that followed the French Revolution in the 1790s.
</P>
<P>
   Many Bretons supported the monarchy and Catholicism, and the new
government suppressed them, massacring thousands and outlawing the
language. It remained banned for more than a century, but a revival
of its use in schools was tolerated after the Socialist government
took power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A desire to speak Breton and celebrate its Celtic culture
(including bagpipe music) is strong in Brittany, said Maguy
Kerisit, who is working on a Breton dictionary, but sentiment for
actual independence from France is weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement was supposed to have disappeared in the 1970s,''
she said. ``But in the past few months it's been created again.
It's an illegal movement that's said they've done bombings, so
people are in jail in Paris for being members.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany is rich in agriculture and tourist income, with no
obvious reason for more than the normal discontent with the French
government. ``The independentists say France takes the benefits of
our wealth and gives back less in exchange,'' Kerisit said, ``but
the majority of the population doesn't agree with bombings or
extreme political movements.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said dynamite from the September theft seems to have
been used by ETA in a car bomb attack that killed a Socialist party
leader, Fernando Buesa Blanco, in Spain last February.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald's worker killed Wednesday was identified as
Laurence Turbec, 28. There were only a handful of customers in the
restaurant at the time. &QL;

CANADIANS OPPOSE PLAN TO RELOCATE GRIZZLIES TO THE US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies that US Wildlife Service will trap the bears in
Canada.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ When the Yanks started running off with the lynx, no
one paid mind. Canada's got lynx aplenty, so the attitude was: Help
yourself, neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   And when the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife
spirited off entire packs of gray wolves for transplant to
Yellowstone National Park, quite a few Canadians _ ranchers,
especially _ cheered good riddance to critters often despised as a
predatory nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But an American grab for grizzly bears is getting growls from
Canadian environmental groups and ordinary folk, although prominent
wildlife biologists in the country support the ambitious if
little-noticed plan to reintroduce North America's fiercest land
mammal to Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, the US Wildlife Service hopes to start capturing
small numbers of grizzlies in the rugged Kootenay region of
southeastern British Columbia. The creatures will be freed in the
Selway-Bitterroot wilderness, a 25,140-square-mile region covering
much of east-central Idaho and extending into Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Activist groups in British Columbia and Alberta are beating the
drums against the scheme. Canada may boast far more grizzlies than
the Lower 48 states, they say _ but that doesn't mean it has bears
to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have this idea of Canada as untrammeled wilderness
just teeming with whatever wildlife gets finished off down there,''
said Michael Sawyer of the Castle-Crown Wilderness Coalition. ``But
we're on a slide toward the grizzly becoming endangered, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the project has taken on an anti-American tone,
with critics complaining that the US treats Canada as a bottomless
reservoir of wild species.
</P>
<P>
   Remarked one provincial environmental official: ``There's
definitely some resentment at the way you people treat our
wilderness as a sort of `Wolves `R' Us.' '' Many of the major
species reintroduction programs undertaken by the US Wildlife
Service rely on animals from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's no question that Canadian grizzlies are
hard-pressed in many of their home ranges these days, especially in
booming Alberta, where logging operations, agriculture, resorts,
roads and an expanding web of busy hiking trails are intruding on
critical bear habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, according to leading wildlife biologists, British
Columbia still possesses such an abundance of the giant beasts _
upwards of 10,000 _ that the removal of a few dozen would not harm
the population. They note that bringing bears to Idaho will mark a
huge leap for a long-range dream of restoring grizzlies to a
1,700-mile corridor stretching from Yukon Territory to Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary effort to restore grizzlies to a
wilderness where they've been completely wiped out,'' said Stephen
Herrero, professor of environmental science at Alberta's University
of Calgary and one of Canada's foremost bear experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never been done in North America,'' he said. ``It seems
a good and neighborly use of British Columbia bears.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the project is to revive a species all but eradicated
from the contiguous states. More than 50,000 grizzlies prowled the
American West before the arrival of 19th Century settlers. Today
there are only 1,000 in scattered pockets, mainly in Yellowstone
and Glacier national parks. (An estimated 35,000 grizzlies thrive
in Alaska, but their habitat is so different they are considered
unsuitable for transplant to the high Rockies.)
</P>
<P>
   The last lonely grizzly inhabiting the Bitterroot wilderness was
bagged by a hunter in the mid-1940s, according to the Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Idaho is a historic habitat for grizzly bears, but
there are none left,'' said Johnna Roy, a wildlife biologist with
the Service's Grizzly Bear Recovery project. ``We want to bring
this magnificent species back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Wildlife Service's primary missions is to revive
populations of endangered species _ from wolves to whooping cranes,
grizzlies to black-footed ferrets _ restoring them to their
original habitats where possible.
</P>
<P>
   For example, earlier this month 30 Canadian lynx captured in
Yukon Territory and British Columbia were released in Colorado's
high country, part of a program to restore the cat to its old
American haunts.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction programs can be extremely controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, for instance, Rocky Mountain ranchers
have howled bloody murder as Wildlife Service biologists
transplanted hundreds of wolves from Alberta to Wyoming and Idaho,
where they've occasionally preyed on sheep, calves and other
livestock _ and, most alarming to ranchers, foraged boldly into
neighboring states. ``Those Canadian wolves treat this place as one
big lunch counter,'' said Jake Cummins of the Montana Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers and farmers have demanded a wolf slaughter. But a US
Appeals Court ruled this year that the wolf reintroduction program
serves a legitimate ecological purpose, and that the Canadian
wolves must not be molested.
</P>
<P>
   Now similar objections are greeting the proposed grizzly bear
project, which is undergoing final environmental review but seems
likely to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners of Custer County, Idaho recently passed a
resolution condemning the plan and ``authorizing'' the shooting of
any federally-protected grizzlies restored to the region _ although
the local prosecutor conceded the decree is probably illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, grizzlies almost certainly don't represent the
sort of threat to livestock posed by wolves. They are solitary
creatures _ each bear needs roughly 1,000 square miles of territory
in which to ramble _ and they usually keep as far as possible from
civilization. Moreover, 90 percent of their diet consists of
berries, bulbs, pine nuts, insects, roots and grasses. When they
eat meat, it's most likely to be carrion, usually dead fish or elk.
</P>
<P>
   But if sheep and cattle can relax, hikers and hunters will have
to tread a bit more warily into the Bitterroots if the grizzly is
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, griz can be grouchy on their home ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern is for human safety,'' said biologist Roy.
``When grizzlies come back, humans are going to have to stop
thinking of themselves as Number 1 in the forest,'' she said in an
interview from Idaho. ``That means practicing some precautions.
Like keeping clean campsites _ garbage attracts bears _ and hanging
their (hunting) kill out of reach. And not trying to take snapshots
of that big female with her cute cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Service's plan is to loose five grizzlies a year
into remoter parts of the region over five years, starting in 2001.
This seed stock of 25 bears should grow to an optimum population of
280 animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very long-term program,'' Roy said. ``We are looking at
50- to 110 years to reach that population level.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies take their name from the silver-tipped hairs
protruding from their shaggy brown coats. Males tip the scales at
600 pounds while females hardly qualify as petite, reaching 350
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bears from southeastern British Columbia are ideal for the
project because their habitat is most similar to conditions found
in the Bitterroot region. But some Canadians fret that their bears
will only be hauled off to their doom, claiming they will likely
fall prey to trigger-happy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much of a Wild West attitude down there, too many
guns,'' said Evelyn Kirkaldy of British Columbia's People's Action
for Threatened Habitat. ``The Americans killed out their own
grizzlies, and now they want ours. So of course we're alarmed.''

<P>
   On the Chinese calendar, this is the Year of the Dragon, but a
group of toy and consumer electronics manufacturers would not be
unhappy if it turned out to be the year of the dog _ the
interactive, robotic dog, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including Fisher-Price and Toy Biz, are
rolling out computerized canines this spring and fall, following in
the path of Sony's Aibo (pronounced EYE-bo), a limited production
robot dog that cost $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The new mechanical palm puppies are less sophisticated, but also
less expensive. They bark, wag their plastic tails and beg for the
affections of anyone willing to pay about $30 to $150 to buy them.
And unlike toy dogs of the pre-PC era, these tech pets seem to
develop behaviors that respond to how their owners play with them.
</P>
<P>
   The first to reach retail shelves is Poo-Chi, the Interactive
Puppy. Made by the people who created the Furby, Tiger Electronics,
a division of Hasbro, Poo-Chi went on sale Wednesday in the United
States at the Manhattan store of FAO Schwarz, where the pseudo
pooches were delivered to the store by dog sled, and at the FAO
Schwarz Web site (www.fao.com).
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi is sensitive to light, touch and sound. It can't walk,
but it can sit, stand and rock on its tiptoes. It can also flap its
ears and open and close its toothless mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Its eyes, red shapes on an LED screen, even show expressions.
When plastic bone is placed near Poo-Chi's nose (which contains an
infrared sensor), ther eyes become heart shapes. The dogs also bark
out six songs, including ``I've been working on the railroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi, which was co-produced by Sega Toys, based in Japan,
went on sale in Japan this month. Shoppers bought 100,000 of them
in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our history with Furby, based on the advanced buzz
product, based on what happened in Japan, we think it's got all the
earmarks for one of those crazy phenomena of the toy world,'' said
David Niggli, chief operating officer of FAO Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger executives said the company was preparing a more advanced
(and probably more expensive) version of Poo-Chi for the market.
And later this year, Tiger will release i-Cybie, a much more
sophisticated robotic dog that will cost about $150.
</P>
<P>
   Shown at this year's Toy Fair in New York was Robotic Puppy by
Fisher- Price, Tekno by Manley Toy Quest and Puppy Magic, a sort of
a hybrid of an electronic dog and a plush toy by Toy Biz, a
division of Marvel Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Robotic Puppy responds to a series of pre-set commands that can
be delivered orally over a headset or manually with a remote
control pad.
</P>
<P>
   Tekno can be trained to do simple tricks by way of a related Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Puppy Magic, which comes with a litter of four newborn puppies,
uses electronic sensors and mechanics to give the impression that
the mother dog recognizes and cares for her offspring.  &QL;

<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the discussion about Confederate flags and symbols in
South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi, I haven't seen anything
about the flag situation in Arkansas, President Clinton's home
state. Is the Confederate flag flown over the Capitol in Little
Rock? Does the state flag include any Confederate symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Confederate flag isn't flown over the Capitol, said Renie
Rule of the Arkansas secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   The state flag does incorporate a symbol that nods at Arkansas'
Confederate history, but it's not conspicuous. The flag has a
diamond-shaped design bordered by a wide blue band. Within the band
are 25 stars signifying that Arkansas was the 25th state to enter
the Union. The word ARKANSAS is in the center of the flag, with one
star above it and three below. The book ``State Names, Seals, Flags
and Symbols: A Historical Guide'' cites a 1913 act of the Arkansas
Legislature, amended in 1923, stating that the star above the
letter ``R'' represents the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   As the act notes, from May 1, 1861, to May 23, 1865, Arkansas
was ``part of and under dominion of the Confederate States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've had the opportunity to see Elton John in several
concerts over the past few years. While performing, he drinks from
a can of Diet Coke. But I've also noticed that on occasion the
label has been blanked out so the name doesn't show. What's up with
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Diet Coke remains his drink of choice, insiders say. Even on
the occasions when the label isn't visible, it's still Diet Coke,
we're told. A fan who has attended all of Sir Elton's Atlanta
performances said he could recall the can being masked on only one
occasion: a private concert when the singer was hired by webMD to
perform for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the name Ku Klux Klan? It's an odd
combination of words and their spellings.
</P>
<P>
   A: It apparently comes from the Greek word kyklos, from which
comes the English word ``circle,'' plus Klan (clan), spelled with a
K for the sake of alliteration. The KKK was formed as a social club
by a group of Confederate Army veterans in Pulaski, Tenn., in the
1860s. Although it was disbanded in 1869, local branches remained
active for another few years. It has revived and declined several
times since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do other countries conduct census surveys on a regular basis?
What's the history of the census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States is by no means the only country counting
its residents. In fact the United Nations, which encourages all
nations to conduct complete, periodic censuses, publishes manuals
of recommended census procedures and works to establishes standards
so it can collect accurate world statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Early censuses date to ancient Rome. In 1086, 20 years after
William the Conqueror defeated England, his officials enumerated
the country's land, people and property in the Domesday Book.
</P>
<P>
   The first modern census _ one that was complete, direct and
periodic _ was conducted by the United States in 1790. Britain has
conducted a modern census every year since 1801, except in 1941,
during World War II. France took its first modern census in 1836.
Others following included Belgium, 1846; Italy, 1861; Germany,
1871; India, 1871-72; Russia and Egypt, 1897; and Japan, 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of John Hinckley, the man who shot President
Ronald Reagan? Is he still in jail?
</P>
<P>
   A: John W. Hinckley Jr. isn't in jail. Since he was found by a
jury to be not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of
Reagan and three others in 1981, he has been locked up at St.
Elizabeths Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There's a recent development in the case, however, that is
continuing to evolve. Hospital officials are recommending that
Hinckley, 44, be granted ``conditional release'' for unsupervised
visits with his parents on one weekend day each week. The parents
live within the 50-mile radius of the hospital, required as one
element of the conditional release. Over the past six months,
Hinckley has visited several Washington-area shopping malls,
restaurants and bookstores under the supervision of hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office, which opposes the hospital
officials' plans, has asked Senior U.S. District Judge June Green
for a hearing. Green has expressed skepticism over the years about
claims that Hinckley is making progress.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent essay in Time, Patti Davis vigorously opposed the
proposed brief releases of the man who shot her father. She asks:
``Is Hinckley less insane now? Is he no longer violent?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura offered any public opinion
on the South Carolina flag controversy?
</P>
<P>
   A: The subject came up in February on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
when three govenors _ Ventura, an independent; Roy Barnes of
Georgia, a Democrat; and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican _
were asked if they favored removing the emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura declined to comment. Following his lead, Barnes said,
``I think it's wrong for all of us who are outside to go in and
give advice.'' Ridge endorsed removing the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A small creek runs behind our home. With the possibility of
water restrictions looming again this summer, I'm wondering: Is
there any danger in using this creek water, which probably includes
runoff from yards and subdivision storm drains, to irrigate our
family vegetable garden?
</P>
<P>
   A:If the stream is fast-flowing, it probably will be safe to use
it for that purpose. But if it's sluggish, like it would be during
a drought, anything coming from runoff would be concentrated and
shouldn't be used. If you decide that the creek is flowing fast
enough for the water to be acceptable, it is recommended that you
irrigate from it in the middle of the week, because people tend to
put out pesticides on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip: Don't use the creek water as an irrigation source
right after a rain, when the runoff is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While we were touring the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, we
were told that the Vehicle Assembly Building is one of the largest
in the world in cubic feet. What's larger?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Kennedy Space Center says the building encloses 129.4
million cubic feet of space. The Boeing Co.'s factory building in
Everett, Wash., is considerably larger, with a volume of 472
million cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, consider the Pentagon, which is often called the
largest office building in the world: It has a volume of 77 million
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) some years ago
said she celebrated her birthday with several cakes, one of which
was decorated with a ``black flag.'' What is a black flag?
</P>
<P>
   A: A red, black and green flag symbolizing African nationhood
was adopted in 1920 by the Universal Negro Improvement Association
and African Communities League. Many African nations chose those
same colors later for their national flags, but the 1920 version _
credited to Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the UNIA-ACL _ is said to be
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey followers said red was chosen to represent ``the blood
which men must shed for their redemption and liberty,'' green ``for
the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland,'' and black for ``the
color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the flag can be found online at
http://unia-acl.org/history/flagstore.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has the U.S. government been counting heads for a
census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first U.S. census began on Aug. 2, 1790, and lasted about
18 months. Enumerators on horseback had to ride through the
countryside to count most of the population. Many people refused to
cooperate, because they didn't know why the government needed
information about them (some things haven't changed, have they?).
</P>
<P>
   When the tally was complete, it showed the nation had a
population of 3,893,874.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that a barrel of crude oil contains 42
gallons. How many gallons of gasoline would be refined from that
same barrel of oil?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because of the reduction in density of many crude components
during processing, that 42 gallons yields 44 gallons of
``finished'' refinery products, of which gasoline amounts to 19 1/2
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder (in gallons): distillate fuel oil, 8.61; jet fuel,
4.20; residual fuel oil, 2.77; petroleum coke, 1.60 gallons;
asphalt and road oils, 1.39; liquified gases, 1.43; petrochemical
feedstocks, 1.22; miscellaneous, 2.98; finished aviation gasoline,
0.08; and kerosene, 0.25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Q&AMP;A item about salary and perks of members of
Congress cited the National Taxpayers Union as the source of
information. I'm very interested, because I think what Congress
members get is outrageous. I never heard of the Taxpayers Union
before. What does it do, and how can I get more information about
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an advocacy group that calls itself ``the (nation's)
largest grass-roots taxpayer organization, with more than 300,000
members across all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1969, the organization says it works for
constitutional amendments to curtail deficit spending and restrict

   Q: The NCAA men's South regional basketball finals will be held
at the Georgia Dome next year. Is there a number I can call, or
address to write or send e-mail, to get information or first notice
of ticket sales?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number: 404-222-6222. Information also can be found
online at www.ramblinwreck.com.
</P>
<P>
   But don't delay. Ticket requests must be received by April 28
for the random ticket selection. The games will be played March 23
and 25, 2001. Tickets are $80 and $90 for both the Friday and
Sunday sessions. Ticket requests received after April 28 will be
filled on a first-come, first-served basis depending on
availability.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets will be mailed Nov. 1 to those whose requests were
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently vacationed in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and saw many
restaurants advertising ``Calabash seafood buffet.'' What do they
mean by ``Calabash''? How is that different from any other seafood?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calabash is a fishing village just across the North Carolina
line, about 25 miles from Myrtle Beach. As Stephen Greene of the
Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce explains, restaurants in
Calabash started a tradition of deep-frying locally caught fish,
crabs, shrimp and oysters in a lightly seasoned cornmeal batter and
serving them _ along with home-style vegetables, hot breads, pies
and cobblers _ in an all-you-can-eat buffet. The concept was so
ppular that restaurants in Myrtle Beach began to copy it, bringing
it to both sides of the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Washington Post had an article April 5 about an
adventurer who planned to fly a World War II-era open cockpit plane
to the North Pole. The plane was to depart that day from
Gaithersburg, Md. Can you update me on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The project started on schedule when the pilot, Gustavus
McLeod, took off from Gaithersburg in his own plane, a 1939 Boeing
PT-17 Stearman. If successful, he will be the first person to pilot
an open-cockpit plane to the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod's 3,500-mile itinerary, which originally was to take 12
days: Hamilton, Elliot Lake, Jerraldton Lake and Pickle Lake, in
Ontario; Church Hill, in Manitoba; Rankin Inlet, Taloyuak, Resolute
and Weather Station Eureka, in Nunavut; 86 degrees north latitude
(ice caps); 90 degrees latitude (geographic North Pole).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenberg, McLeod's spokesman in Alexandria, Va., told Q&AMP;A
April 12 that the pilot had encountered a problem ``with a $1.50
gasket throwing the flight off for another day or so.'' The trouble
occurred when the temperature suddenly dropped from 9 degrees below
zero to 26 below on the leg between Pickle Lake and Churchill. The
gasket broke, with oil leaking from the engine.
</P>
<P>
   As of that afternoon, McLeod was awaiting a new gasket to be
delivered from Oklahoma City. If it worked, and a short test flight
was successful, Rosenberg said, McLeod's quest would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
   News releases are posted online at www.northpole2000.com.
National Geographic is filming the project for a future TV special,
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the U.S. government footing the bills for flights, lodging
and meals incurred in connection with Elian Gonzales' father and
the rest of the Cuban entourage being in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. A State Department representative said all costs involved
are being paid by the Cuban government. The only role played by the
United States was to facilitate arrangements, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV show said Easter began as a pagan holiday in orchards or
groves and consisted of fertility rituals. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't know about the orchards and groves, but it did have
pagan beginnings associated with fertility. While the origin of the
English name Easter is uncertain, some scholars trace it to Eastre,
the Anglo-Saxon goddess who presided over the vernal equinox.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient spring festivals had a resurrection theme _ new life
afer the winter _ and fertility obviously played a part, which
explains how eggs came to be included as symbols. Another symbol
that evolved was the hare, symbol of fertility in ancient Egypt,
which in North America was replaced by the Easter bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to be in California in July. Do you know the date and
site of this year's U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you hope to be a spectator, you'll need to move your trip
up a bit. The tournament will be June 15-18 at Pebble Beach Golf
Links in Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The test dummies used in automobile crash testing could weigh
as little as 10-15 pounds. But to be realistic, shouldn't they be
much heavier, say in the 180-pound range?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dummies with the weight you mention are intended to simulate
children. But in fact the dummies cover a much wider range. Those
manufactured by Applied Safety Technologies Corp., for instance,
range from a newborn infant to what's termed a 95th percentile
male. Sample weights: Hybrid II 6-year-old child, 33.3 pounds;
Hybrid II 50th percentile male, 164 pounds; Hybrid III 5th
percentile female, 106-110 pounds; and Hybrid III 95th percentile
male, 223.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The dummies simulate what happens to a human inside a vehicle
when a crash occurs, and have evolved into quite realistic
``people.'' One of the newest is the Hybrid III 5th percentile
female, made of vinyl and stainless steel and dressed in
fashion-forward Capri-length pants with a form-fitting cotton knit
top and military-issue size 8W shoes. She is stuffed with
instruments so researchers can determine what might happen in a
crash involving a typical small female. Her cost is an estimated
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dummies' specifications are mandated by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. They are intended to gauge head,
neck, chest, spine, leg and other injuries both from impact and
from air bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed information on Applied Safety Technologies' ``human
surrogates'' can be found online at www.astc.net. Other companies
also make crash test dummies, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While watching the Masters on TV, I noticed that several
golfers were violating what I consider one of golf's oldest
customs, which is the wearing of a collared golf shirt. David
Duval, specifically, could be seen wearing a crew neck. Is that now
permissible at Augusta National Golf Club?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no policy requiring collared shirts, said Augusta
National's Glenn Greenspan. The only dress code requirement of the
PGA Tour is long pants on players, he added, and that's the
guideline used at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who invented the VCR, and how did it develop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The concept was the brainchild of independent American
inventor Jerome H. Lemelson (1923-97), who amassed more than 500
patents, including essential parts of the camcorder, cordless
telephone, fax machine, data- and word-processing systems, and
industrial robots.
</P>
<P>
   While the development of videotape recorders began in the 1940s,
the first such device capable of recording a television picture of
broadcasting quality on magnetic tape didn't come along until 1956.
That recorder, developed by Charles P. Ginsberg, Charles E.
Anderson and Ray Dolby, and manufactured by the Ampex Corp. of
Redwood City, Calif., was demonstrated simultaneously in Redwood
City and Chicago on April 14, 1956. The first tape, 2 inches wide,
moved at a speed of 15 inches per second; a single 14-inch reel
accommodated a 65-minute recording.
</P>
<P>
   VCRs as we know them today evolved soon afterward. Japan's Sony
Corp. marketed the first open-reel videotape recorder for home use,
the TCV-2010, in 1966. It required a separate camera, set up on a
tripod, and a separate microphone to record sound. The Betamax,
which was sold in the United States by Sony, followed in 1975. It
was built into a console that also contained a Sony color TV set.
The tape was contained in a plastic cassette to make it easy to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   NRA video: Q&AMP;A recently reported on the National Rifle
Association's online video about gun control laws in Australia,
saying it apparently had been removed from the NRA's Web site
(www.nra.org). But the video still can be viewed online at
NRA-Live, a subset of the Web site that requires Shockwave
software. The Shockwave requirement can be bypassed, however, by
using this address:
http://nraila.org/research/20000329-BanningGuns-001.shtml. It
contains a link to the Australia video and other videos and should
work for most Internet users.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I own a brick house that is over 50 years old and some of the
bricks seem to be peeling or shedding at the surface. This is
especially true of the bricks under several windows.
</P>
<P>
   These windows have concrete sills on the outside and I notice
that some of the concrete sills have small cracks in them.
</P>
<P>
   Could these cracks have something to do with the bricks under
and near them peeling off in thin layers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The condition you are speaking of is called spalling and one
of the main causes for this problem is moisture entering or
penetrating the bricks.
</P>
<P>
   During freezing weather this moisture freezes and expands,
causing pieces of the brick facing to flake off.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks in the concrete sills could be allowing water to soak
into and penetrate the bricks and the mortar joints between the
bricks.
</P>
<P>
   The first step should be to patch these cracks with a suitable
patching cement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, I would advise inspecting all the mortar joints
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Remove mortar that is cracked or crumbling and refill those
joints with fresh mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house is 24 years old and has a bay window in the living
room that sticks out about two feet from the front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The wood along the bottom of this bay window's frame has several
rotted spots where the wood is spongy and soft.
</P>
<P>
   Short of hiring a carpenter for a major renovation, is there any
way I can repair this myself?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the rotted area is not too extensive and no serious
structural members are involved, then the rotted wood can be cut
out.
</P>
<P>
   It can then be ``rebuilt'' or rejuvenated by packing the area
with one of the two-part epoxy patching compounds that are sold for
this purpose in marine supply stores, as well as in hardware stores
and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   After scraping out the rotted wood, these compounds are either
injected into the wood by drilling a series of holes, or they are
spread on and packed into the crevices with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   They penetrate, solidify, and harden the wood fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our detached garage is finished with painted hardboard siding
that we were told would stand up to continuous exposure. However,
on one side of the garage this siding is now peeling and rotting.
</P>
<P>
   What should we do about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the paint is peeling it is probably exposing the hardboard
to the weather, causing it to soften and break down.
</P>
<P>
   The peeling and flaking paint should be scraped off down to the
bare wood, then the surface primed and repainted with at least two
coats of paint.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the hardboard siding is spongy or soft, then those
sections should be cut out and replaced or patched.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that after you paint, the paint should be renewed
regularly _ before it starts to weather.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The cement blocks in our foundation seem to be breaking down
and seeping sand.
</P>
<P>
   Paint will not stick to these blocks any more _ it just peels
off after a short while.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of coating can we apply to prevent the blocks from
falling apart completely?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds as though you need more than a simple coating _ you
probably need to have a coat of cement stucco, or thin mortar,
applied to cover the blocks completely.
</P>
<P>
   This usually requires the services of a professional mason
contractor since the stucco or mortar will have to be troweled on
after first applying a coat of special latex masonry adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that if the blocks are really in bad shape, a
new wall of blocks may have to be put up in front of the existing
wall.
</P>

LET SOMEONE ELSE LOOK FOR BARGAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughters and I are impatiently awaiting the arrival of our
first online cosmetics purchase, an order that includes something
described as ``nose strips.'' We also are getting deep pore
cleanser and _ here is the one we are most eager to acquire _ six
packets of self-heating masks.
</P>
<P>
   While we do not know the exact purpose of most of this stuff, my
11-year-old has heard that the mask product consists of a little
package of white lotion flecked with tiny blue specks. She says
that when you rub it on your face, the specks break open and heat
the skin. Her 9-year-old sister thinks this sounds very soothing.
</P>
<P>
   You only need imagine how tense a 9-year-old can get to see how
badly we needed this multi-item Biore beauty kit, which usually
lists for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, my daughters, who have dedicated their lives to the
scientific study of cosmetics and recently tested 41 shades of
lipstick at a sleepover, would have no qualms over the $25 list
price of this Biore multi-item beauty kit. No, their concerns were
research-oriented: Would the specks burn? Would the dye turn their
skin a permanent blue? Would their friends be very, very jealous?
</P>
<P>
   But there was another reason we ordered the kit: It was free _
to any first-time customer at PlanetRx who placed an order of $10
or more at the Web site (www.planetrx.com). Since I needed to buy
Band-Aids and children's vitamins anyway, the blue specks cost me
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I love a good deal. In fact, whenever I shop online, I feel
obligated to get one. Competition among Internet retailers has
become so fierce that I have become conditioned to getting
something _ free shipping, a coupon, half off, something _ for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem has been creating a systematic shopping
strategy. I knew the bargains were out there, but finding them was
hit or miss. Until a couple of weeks ago, I didn't even know
PlanetRx existed. Then I found out about Bargaindog.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaindog points shoppers toward the latest discounts, freebies
and sales offered by about 300 online merchant partners _ including
well-known retailers like J.Crew, Amazon, CDNow and eToys _ who, in
return, give Bargaindog a commission.
</P>
<P>
   I registered at Bargaindog (www.bargaindog.com) and filled out a
survey about my shopping interests. The site tracks 15 categories
of merchandise, like electronics, cooking equipment and pet
supplies. Figuring that no serious shopper would pass up
information about any bargain, I checked all the boxes, indicating
that I was interested in hearing about special deals in all 15
categories.
</P>
<P>
   So what if I never planned to purchase an item like a Lutron
Rotary Dimmer (marked down 50 percent, to $5, at eLights.com) or a
re-sealer to keep potato chips fresh (marked down from $19.99 to
the incredibly low price of $5.95 at YouCanSave.com)?
</P>
<P>
   Once a week, Bargaindog sends me a free, personalized e-mail
newsletter listing more than a dozen of the latest discounts,
freebies and sales in each category. If I am interested in
anything, I can click on the link embedded in the newsletter. That
way, while I shop directly at the retailer's site, the merchant
knows to give Bargaindog credit for referring the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bargaindog has a searchable database of all
bargains that have not expired. As of last week, the list numbered
522, including the PlanetRx offer.
</P>
<P>
   But after I ordered the Biore beauty kit, I had second thoughts.
How did I know if Bargaindog was steering me toward its partners'
offers without bothering to ascertain whether they were the best
deals? So I phoned Josh Schanker, the founder of Bargaindog. ``How
do I know these are real bargains?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Schanker assured me that Bargaindog applied strict criteria.
``Depending on the product category,'' he said, ``we have different
levels of discounts that each product must adhere to. For instance,
all books have to be at least 50 percent off. Electronics, 25
percent. For apparel, at least 35 percent off list price.''
</P>
<P>
   The markdown requirements are based on how much of a discount a
customer might expect to see in specific categories, Schanker said.
``We found that the apparel and home categories are likely to be
deeply discounted. But electronics is probably our least discounted
category. There's a small margin of profit on those items.''
</P>
<P>
   Schanker said Bargaindog employees screen prospective bargains
to ensure ``that merchants will not try to publicize items that are
not really deep discounts.'' So only selected sale items offered by
merchant partners are featured on Bargaindog.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last week I found dozens of items listed for sale
at J.Crew online, marked down as little as 20 percent. But when I
searched for J.Crew on Bargaindog, only two (deeply discounted)
items were listed: corduroy pants, marked down from $49.50 to
$24.99, and a long-sleeve, v-neck sweater, marked down from $20 to
$9.99.
</P>
<P>
   When I searched independently for some of Bargaindog's items
online, I did not find lower prices. For instance, a 10-minute
search for ``Biore'' turned up an offer for six self-heating masks
for $5.99 at shopinprivate.com. I also found the chips re-sealer at
www.asotv.com for $5.99.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaindog also encourages shoppers to rate the bargains.
Concerning the v-neck sweater, for instance, one shopper wrote,
``You can buy the same thing at local discount stores and not have
to pay $5 for shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schanker said, his favorite way to search the
Bargaindog database is by rating _ choose a category, then click
Sort by Rating _ to see which deals shoppers thought were the best
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you've jumped on bargains yourself?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an occupational hazard,'' he said, describing a time he
ordered 10 personalized Post-it Notes pads from iPrint.com (a
$22.99 value) for $3.20 to cover shipping. ``I think that bargain
is still available,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why I would need 10 personalized Post-it Notes pads,
can't you? I went to iPrint.com and spent 15 minutes choosing paper
color and font. When they arrive, the pads will say ``ALERT'' in
handwriting that looks like a ransom note.
</P>
<P>
   I am not sure what we will use them for. Maybe to blot
lipstick. &QL;

A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS AN INTERNET MARKETER

<P>
   In 1996, Melisse Shapiro's novel ``Lip Service'' was rejected by
every major publishing house in New York. After the publishers told
her that finding an audience for the book would be difficult,
Shapiro, who writes under the name M.J. Rose, set out to prove them
wrong. She created a Web site where the book could be downloaded
for a fee, and waited for her audience to come to her. Few came.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., realized that she had
neglected the final piece of the puzzle: a marketing plan. ``Nobody
on the planet was going to know the book was there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro then figured out what she needed to do: Publicize the
book on the Web in any way possible, including offering to write
reviews of other peoples' books on sites frequented by women, in
return for a mention of her book.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she sold copies of the book through Amazon.com and
garnered enthusiastic reviews on that site. Her efforts not only
helped her establish a readership but also grabbed the attention of
a net-surfing publishing executive who purchased the book for
mail-order book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro landed a contract for ``Lip Service'' with Pocketbooks.
The book, which was published in hardback in August 1999, will be
issued in paperback this summer, and Shapiro has written two more
novels for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, she was able to avoid the mistake made by many artists
who leap onto the Internet with a single-serving Web site expecting
to be discovered instantly, showered with accolades and riches, and
able to give up their day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ```If you build it, they will come,' just isn't true,'' said Eve
Smith, project manager for Open Studio: The Arts Online
(www.openstudio.org), a four-year-old project financed by the
Benton Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts that
helps artists and arts groups learn how to use the Web to promote
their work and find communities of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   To start on the road to recognition, Smith advises artists to
list their Web sites with as many search engines as possible and
join electronic mailing lists and other online efforts to build a
community of colleagues and potential fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merely having a Web presence will not be enough to attract
people to what you do,'' added Smith, noting that the Open Studio,
which is based in Washington, was founded because artists and arts
groups were perceived to be among those most likely to fall into
the digital divide without proper training. To date, the project
has helped more than 1,100 artists and arts groups with the nuances
of getting recognition on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the unlikelihood of being discovered the
old-fashioned self-produced, self-maintained Web site way, and
without the time, energy and unbridled drive of Shapiro, artists
and writers now have plenty of Web sites where they can gather,
post their work _ or images of it _ and offer it for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites are Art on the Net (www.art.net), and iTheo.com
(www.itheo.com) which features online galleries, and MightyWords
(www.mightywords.com) an e-book store where authors can post work
to sell in electronic format only.
</P>
<P>
   These sites generally offer Web space to all comers, providing
the artists have a product to sell that is not extreme or obscene.
Mightywords charges $1 a month to maintain an author's file on the
site, and posting on iTheo is free. Both sites take a commission on
each sale, up to 50 percent in some cases, for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of aligning with umbrella sites, the sites'
founders say, is greater recognition. MightyWords and iTheo.com,
for instance, advertise online and in print, creating awareness
that is intended to lure traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Artists showing work on these sites may be tempted to stop and
let the advertising bring interested patrons to them, but even at
these sites, the ``if you build it, they will come'' maxim does not
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The artist must be a partner in marketing efforts, said Web site
executives who are eager to lend a hand with online marketing
toolboxes found on the sites.
</P>
<P>
   MightyWords, where anyone can publish anything and offer it for
sale in an electronic format only, offers a service, Writer's
Corner, that is a marketing primer for authors, complete with HTML
formatting tips and press releases in template form. ITheo.com does
much the same, providing software for artists to create and
maintain contact lists and opening communication between the
artists and their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in doing the heavy lifting in terms of getting
people to the site,'' said Judy Kirkpatrick, executive vice
president of MightyWords. But, she added, ``authors have to be just
as involved as you are in making the work available.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are 5,000 authors selling 7,000 novels, novellas, short
stories and nonfiction works on the site, which began operating
about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ITheo.com is named for Vincent van Gogh's brother, Theo, who was
a legendary handholder for his brother and many other artists in
his day. The site helps manage e-mail lists, accepts buyers' credit
cards and offers discounts on supplies like brushes, paint and
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that artists were awkwardly exploiting the Web,''
said Akash Agarwal, co-founder and chief executive officer of
iTheo.com. ``They weren't using it to segment their business for
additional exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach seems to be working for Aondrea Maynard, a painter
in San Francisco, who has sold four paintings on iTheo since the
site began on March 20. Maynard said that a year ago she had been
naive about the Web, but she said she had been ``pretty active and
comfortable'' promoting her work.
</P>
<P>
   She is not represented by a gallery, and has shown much of her
work in cafes, home accessory boutiques and beauty salons in her
native San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Maynard showed 11 paintings on the Web site, and was
an instant hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be able to grow my buyer base pretty quickly,''
said Maynard, who added that breaking into the traditional bricks
and mortar gallery is difficult for emerging artists like herself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential audiences that the new sites are intent on
bringing to artists, there are those who prefer to fly solo on the
Web and, despite the odds, are discovered.
</P>
<P>
   One artist who credits the Web with a string of successes is the
painter Karen Jacobs, an abstract expressionist in New Orleans.
Jacobs built her Web site four years ago to extend her audience
outside the South. Shortly after she started the site, she was
signed by a Detroit gallery, which quickly sold her work.
</P>
<P>
   And late last year, Jacobs was discovered by the New York art
community. Independent film makers working on a $1 million movie
about a struggling artist, ``The Next Big Thing,'' picked her to
create the artwork for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put out a lot of feelers and were hoping through word of
mouth to find out about local artists who might be interested in
promoting their work,'' said Joel Posner, the film's producer and
co-writer. Posner's real-world search proved fruitless, sending him
to the Web, where, after sifting through a hundreds of sites, he
found Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been my dream for years to be ready for a lot to happen,
and this is an incredible stroke of good luck,'' said Jacobs, who
is delighted by the prospect of the national, even international
exposure that the film might bring to her work.
</P>
<P>
   Luck indeed. Jacobs said she listed her Web site with as many
search engines as possible, and joined artists' groups online. She
maintained the site, updating it monthly. She did what online
marketing experts advise: build it, put the word out about it, and
then watch them come. &QL;

FUTURE HOLLYWOOD: PERSONAL NETWORKS AND LITTLE PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some entertainment and computer executives have seen the future,
and it is one in which consumers surrender more of their privacy
than they do today.
</P>
<P>
   At a panel discussion in Las Vegas last week on what the
entertainment industry will be like in 2010, participants were
giddy with the prospect of the world's population tuning in via the
Internet, contributing to content and giving up privacy to
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, we are the Jetsons,'' said Mayra Langon Reisman, one
of the participants in the discussion, which was part of the
National Association of Broadcasters convention. Reisman, the
founder of Film Scouts, a Web entertainment site, noted that
entertainment in the future will be about ``on-demand immersion and
interactivity'' using the kinds of wireless technology already in
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be able to immerse themselves in whatever content
they desire at whatever time they choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The price consumers pay, participants said, will be in their
privacy. ``You're giving up information for Little Brother,'' said
Errol Gerson, senior agent in the new media division at Creative
Artists Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Paddison, vice president for worldwide interactive
marketing at New Line Cinema, said a college student in the year
2010 who wants the new Mariah Carey CD, for example, will be able
to get it free by giving lots of information about himself. The
entertainment companies, he added, will use the information to
create products and advertisements specifically designed to add
value to that person's life.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, called ``permission marketing,'' is in use today.
As technology advances, it is expected to become ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Sun Microsystems' chief researcher, John
Gage, predicted that 5 billion people will be online by 2010,
feeding everything they see into at least 2 billion handheld
devices through minicameras installed somewhere on their bodies.
Broadcasting will be extinct; ``bodycasting'' will be the wave of
the future, Gage said. Privacy, he added, will be traded for
``convenience and security.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of technology and the prediction that
bandwidth _ which is most valuable to broadcasters today _ will
cost nothing, every citizen can become a content creator. Instead
of everyone having a Web site, picture everyone in charge of his
own little television network.
</P>
<P>
   That notion caused the panelists to re-affirm the value of
``talent'' and ``big events'' like the Oscars or the Olympics,
complete with all the great drama and ceremony that the human, now
wired race, will still desire.
</P>
<P>
   With so much choice in entertainment, what might be needed most
are more effective program guides, said Stuart Gross, chief
executive of Random Order, an advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though predictions are that with fully immersible
technology, movie-viewing may occur on a wristwatch in an airport,
it may not. People will still want non-interactive entertainment
experiences in a comfortable environment. To that end, Gross
predicted that ``couch potatoes will not die in the year 2010.''

CHINA WARNS AGAINST CLOSER U.S.-TAIWAN TIES  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Adoption by Washington of a proposal to enhance
military ties with Taiwan would have a ``disastrous'' effect on
U.S. relations with China, a leading government adviser warned here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be an openly hostile act by the United States
toward China,'' the adviser, Xu Shiquan, said of the proposed law
in an interview. ``Sino-American relations would plunge again to
the bottom, and American interests would be seriously damaged.'' Xu
is president of the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, the leading government-run research
group on Taiwanese affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act would mandate closer
military cooperation between the United States and Taiwan. The
United States has not had a formal alliance with Taiwan since it
switched diplomatic recognition to the mainland in 1979, but under
the Taiwan Relations Act of the same year it has pledged to provide
Taiwan with the means to defend itself against attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which Clinton says is unneeded and overly provocative,
passed in the House of Representatives by a huge margin on Feb. 1.
Its prospects in the Senate are unclear, but this week, after the
administration said it would not sell Taiwan some of the advanced
weapons it had requested, Republican senators vowed to press harder
for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Xu described Beijing's response to last month's
presidential elections in Taiwan as ``cool and restrained.'' But he
held out little hope of easing cross-straits tensions unless
Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, makes a change in basic
policy and embraces the principle of ``one China'' under Beijing's
ultimate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was long an advocate of formal independence for Taiwan,
which Beijing, which considers the island a province separated by
the civil war of the 1940s, has said would be grounds for military
intervention. More recently, however, Chen has moderated this
position, saying that a declaration of independence is unnecessary
because Taiwan already enjoys de facto sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election March 18, Chen has worked to avoid angering
Beijing, saying he seeks peace and offering to negotiate an end to
restrictions on commerce across the Taiwan Straits. As his prime
minister he selected the departing defense minister, from the
Nationalist Party, who opposes independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Xu dismissed Chen's olive branches and expressed pessimism
about any negotiations between Beijing and Taipei in the next few
years. ``I don't think he is any closer to the one-China
principle,'' Xu said of Chen. ``He still insists that Taiwan is an
independent and sovereign state and that `one China' is not a
principle, but an issue to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has given some breathing room to Chen, who takes office
May 20, by promising to ``listen to what he says and watch what he
does.'' But it has repeatedly stated that it will talk with his
government only if Chen agrees that Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China.
</P>
<P>
   Xu also predicted that Chen would find it difficult to make that
leap, especially given his weak political position. And Xu offered
no hope that Beijing would seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is anxious to see Taipei lift its restrictions on direct
commerce and communications with the mainland, for example, but it
will not take up Chen's offer to discuss even this practical
matter, Xu said, without agreement on principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a question of opening internal links within one
country, then we welcome it,'' he said. ``If it's `state-to-state'
links, then that's a provocation, and we cannot accept it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beijing has said that if Taiwan will accept that it is part of
China, it can have enormous autonomy, retaining its own political
system, economy and military. But any moves to formalize
independence would be regarded as a provocation to war.
</P>
<P>
   Xu said that Beijing's current campaign to vilify the woman
elected as Chen's vice president, Annette Lu, was intended as a
``warning to the extremist elements'' of Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party. ``The aim is to deter the extremists from doing
reckless things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu, a graduate of Harvard Law School and a longtime advocate of
Taiwanese independence, has offended Beijing with recent remarks.
For more than a week she has been denounced daily by the official
Chinese press as a ``traitor'' and ``scum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By criticizing Annette Lu, the mainland is actually helping
Chen Shui-bian,'' Xu said, because it is discouraging words or
deeds that would cause a crisis in relations.

PAYING FOR CAR INSURANCE BY THE MILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ohio)   (Circuits)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electricity bills depend on how much electricity is used each
month. Soon auto insurance premiums, too, may be metered, based
partly on how much the car is driven.
</P>
<P>
   That is the goal of Progressive Auto Insurance, which is testing
a system that uses Global Positioning Satellite technology to track
when, where and how much its auto insurance customers drive _ and
then charges them accordingly. A pilot version of the program is
being tested in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The system is the brainchild of Robert J. McMillan, a business
development leader at Progressive, a major auto insurance company
based in Mayfield Village, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' McMillan said. ``The less you drive, the
less you pay.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan came up with the idea of metered car insurance five
years ago when he found out that GPS technology could be used to
recover stolen cars. ``It occurred to me that we could record
driving behavior and patterns and then offer insurance by the
mile,'' he said. The company has been awarded two patents for the
way it electronically retrieves data from vehicles and uses that
information to set insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,100 people in Texas have signed up for a test run of the
program since it began 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Gus Kopriva of Houston, who owns four cars. ``I'm
saving a lot of money,'' he said. ``I use some of the cars
intermittently, and when I do, I pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The average user saves about 25 percent, McMillan said. ``When
people live close to work or have multiple vehicles, car-pool or
use public transportation, they can save even more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The time of day affects the cost. ``A mile driven at 2 a.m. is
four or five times more expensive than one driven at 7 a.m.,''
McMillan said. ``Our data show accident rates per mile are much
higher later in the night.'' Commuting trips to work are cheapest
because the trips occur on familiar routes in relatively slow
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said even customers who drove long distances could save
money on their current rates by avoiding nighttime driving.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietary system used by Progressive includes a GPS
receiver, cell-phone modem and a microprocessor with a small amount
of computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   The miniprocessor uses the GPS receiver to record the car's
location _ latitude and longitude _ and the date and time every six
minutes while the car is being driven. Once a month the company
computer calls the car through the cell-phone modem and retrieves
the records of the month's travel activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we generate a bill that is similar to a utility bill,
based on your use,'' McMillan said. Twenty-five percent of the fee
represents standard insurance charges for damage and theft coverage
_ taking into account factors like age, number of moving
violations, the driver's sex and the type of car _ and the
remainder is based on use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, rates are based on variables like gender and
age,'' he said. ``We think how you actually use your car is more
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The system cannot fix a flat yet, but it can unlock a locked
car; car owners who are locked out can place a call to the
monitoring center, which relays a command to the microprocessor
through the modem to tell it to open the doors. And if battery
power runs low, the microprocessor can use the modem to notify the
company's central computer so an employee can call the car's owner.
</P>
<P>
   The system can also provide more standard GPS services like
navigation, as well as a panic button linked to a 24-hour
communication system with a live person to handle emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoff for all that convenience and potentially lower
insurance costs is privacy, some say. After all, the system knows
when you are sleeping and when you are awake. It also knows when a
driver has been good or not, at least in terms of speeding, and
perhaps in other areas as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bothered by the lack of privacy,'' Kopriva said.
``That only bothers people with something to hide _ for instance,
if they are having an affair or running drugs.'' Kopriva said he
was glad that the system kept track of his cars for him. ``That
would come in very handy if one of them was stolen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Kopriva dismissed privacy issues, Steven Goldstein, a
spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group,
predicted that some customers would not want an insurance company
to have specific information about their driving habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will find it invasive,'' he said. ``But others
will be thrilled to death because they will save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans pay about $125 billion each year in premiums for auto
insurance. ``You can't drive your car without it,'' Goldstein said.
``And most Americans do have a car _ except for those under 21, in
jail or living in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new program was noteworthy because it gave this huge
pool of involuntary shoppers more options. ``The more choices
drivers have, the better off they will be as consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive guarantees that the information gathered by the
system will be used only to assess insurance rates and will not be
provided to anyone else without the insured person's consent,
McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the specificity of the details recorded is bound to raise
thorny problems. For instance, the system will know whether the car
stopped at a bar or was near the scene of a crime. And such
information could be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive is talking to state insurance commissions about
expanding the program beyond the test market. The company is also
talking with auto makers about incorporating the system into cars
at the factory. At present, Progressive pays the $500 cost of
installing the system on each customer's car.
</P>
<P>
   If drivers using the new system drive less, that will help the
environment. Allen Greenberg, a policy analyst at the Environmental
Protection Agency in Washington, said initial studies done by the
agency suggested that the amount of driving people did was related
to fuel price. He added: ``We anticipate anywhere from a 10 percent
to 20 percent driving reduction when the fixed cost of driving is
shifted to a variable one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental potential here is very great. The program
offers financial incentives to drive less and therefore reduce
pollutants and improve air quality.''

 KIOSKS FOR MAKING YOUR OWN CDs  
 (Circuits)  
 By KAREN J. BANNAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon Gordin loves music. She is always on the lookout for the
latest dance compilation or trendy album. She is also enthralled by
the idea of downloading MP3 music files onto her computer for her
own use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gordin, 29, an executive assistant from New York,
has been left out of the MP3 craze. She doesn't have a broadband
Internet connection to make quick work of downloading music files
or a CD burner to create her own music CDs. And anyway, she says,
it all seems rather complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For Gordin, music kiosks may be the answer. They let people
create their own discs in a way that is almost as convenient as
buying a prepackaged one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really prefer compilations to one-band discs,'' Gordin said.
``I only recently heard about kiosks, and I can't wait to try it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't have to wait long. Today, three technology companies _
Digital On-Demand, Liquid Audio, and Musicmaker.com _ are designing
and deploying music kiosks in stores across the country. RedDotNet,
a Digital On-Demand subsidiary, has installed kiosks in Target
stores, at music retailers like Sam Goody and Wherehouse
Entertainment and at Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio has set up kiosks in Europe and Asia, and
Musicmaker.com will start installing its kiosks this year. Although
they differ somewhat in design, the kiosks all let consumers select
songs and create music CDs right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiosks give a similar experience to MP3 files,'' said Pierre
Tager, vice president for engineering at Musicmaker.com.
``Customers can browse thousands of tracks, personalize their CD
and take it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiosks fill a need, as shown by the success of MP3 files, said
Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a research
firm. ``If you look at the record charts, over the last 10 years
we've seen an explosion of compilation discs,'' Mooradian said.
``People normally don't want an entire album anymore. That's one of
the reasons MP3s are so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicmaker.com, based in Reston, Va., and Liquid Audio, in
Redwood City, Calif., are counting on that. Both manufacturers'
kiosks let consumers create their own compilation discs, with
thousands of singles to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   But Digital On-Demand, in Carlsbad, Calif., offers only entire
albums. It has relationships with most major record distributors
and offers up to 5,000 albums for purchase. Most of these albums
are selections that the store wouldn't normally carry, said Tom
Szabo, chief executive officer of Digital On-Demand.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the manufacturers' kiosks has a touch screen so users
can browse through a library for songs or albums. Like their
ancestor, the listening kiosk, the music kiosks can be used by
consumers who want to hear 30-second samples of music.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio's kiosk can be connected to a song database on the
Internet, said Gerry Kearby, the company's co-founder and chief
executive, so users may one day be able to choose among hundreds of
thousands of tracks. Today, the company uses a secure private
network to update its kiosks periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Once one or more songs are selected, the digital music files are
recorded onto a blank CD. Although MP3s have become the music
standard on the Internet, kiosk providers are using various file
formats to burn CDs. Users can also select jewel-box album covers
and clip art for a customized cover.
</P>
<P>
   Musicmaker.com's kiosk is self-contained, with a CD recorder and
printer, and a credit card reader for payment. Digital On-Demand
and Liquid Audio send digital files across an in-store network to
printing and recording equipment behind the sales counter. Discs
cost $6 to $20, depending on the number of songs.
</P>
<P>
   If the kiosks become wildly successful, their success may work
against them. Burning a CD isn't quick. Musicmaker.com's kiosk has
an 8X CD-ROM burner within its cabinet. If an album is 32 minutes
long, it takes four minutes to burn it onto a disc. Add that four
minutes to the time it takes for a consumer to browse, select songs
and pay for the choices, and it is apparent that the number of
people who can use the kiosks in an hour is limited. Digital
On-Demand's kiosk could take just as long, depending on the number
of CD-ROM burning stations installed behind a counter.
</P>
<P>
   CDs are only the first step, Mooradian said. All three companies
want to have their kiosks offer digital downloading for portable
MP3 players. The Musicmaker.com kiosk is able to download files to
a Diamond Multimedia Rio MP3 player for $1 per file. In the next
few years, consumers can expect kiosks that offer downloading of
DVD movies, software and electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed with kiosk technology. ``Everything is
happening on the Internet, but I haven't seen anything that makes
me understand how this is going to work in a large consumer
market,'' Mooradian said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordin, at least, is enthusiastic. ``I really can't wait to
give this a whirl,'' she said.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    One year since Columbine. With the passing months, those of us
far from the tragedy have thought of it less often than in those
first few terrible weeks following the rampage. But for those close
to the shooting _ especially the friends and parents of the slain
teenagers_ this must have been an unspeakably painful year.
 &HT;    This week, as thousands of reporters and pilgrims converged to
mark the anniversary of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's assault,
most locals were leaving town to escape the gaze of national
voyeurism into their private grief.
 &HT;    The reporters and the curious did not necessarily want to
recount the awful details of the killings. They wanted to know
about the healing. Has death brought resurrection to Columbine? A
year has passed. Perhaps Columbine is normal again.
 &HT;    But on a recent ``Nightline,'' ABC's John Donovan reported that
healing is slow and sometimes nonexistent. Anger, rage and despair
are still palpable. During the last year, the people of Littleton,
Colo., have experienced more death: Strange suicides and murders
have riddled the community around the high school.
 &HT;    For those of us who embrace Christianity, this grisly
anniversary parallels another tragic commemoration: Holy Week and
its culmination in Easter. On Thursday, as we marked the memorial
of Columbine, millions also marked the memorial of Jesus' last meal
with his disciples.
 &HT;    In both, unexpected betrayal led to murder of innocents.
Interlaced violence and deathcenturies apartyet undeserved,
unexpected and unwelcome.
 &HT;    This year's eerie correspondence between Columbine and Easter
point toward a discomforting aspect of our national character: We
want quick resurrections. American Christianity has never
emphasized Holy Week _ a supposedly morbid exercise in churchgoing
best left to Lutherans, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics. Most
American Christians ignore Tenebrae (the service of ``darkness''),
Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday in favor of Easter
celebration.
 &HT;    We celebrate life,not death. We skip the hard part.
 &HT;    If we skip the hard part, however, Easter quickly devolves into
a sentimental celebration of spring_ a sort of demi-Christmas with
a 6-foot bunny who seems cheap in comparison to Santa. But we
prefer it that way. Cute baby chicks and new church clothes delude
us into thinking that faith is an eternal spring.
 &HT;    After all, Christians are called an ``Easter people.'' The
Resurrection is the basis of Christian belief. Why dwell on the bad
stuff that comes before?
 &HT;    The answer is quite simple: Without death, there can be no
resurrection. Winter always comes before spring.
 &HT;    Perhaps Columbine is a spiritual national winter _a long, cold,
unrelenting winter. The kind of winter people in Minnesota and the
Dakotas know. The darkness breaks, the snow melts, and days of
sunshine bring forth daffodils and tulips. It is over!
 &HT;    Then, from nowhere, a blizzard closes in as if it were once
again December. Will spring ever come? Will it ever end?
 &HT;    Holy Week is much the same. Of its shocking events, the mystery
writer Dorothy Sayers once said, ``God was executed by people
painfully like us, in a society very similar to our own.He was
executed by a corrupt church, a timid politician and a fickle
proletariat led by professional agitators. His executioners made
vulgar jokes about Him, called Him filthy names, taunted Him,
smacked Him in the face, flogged Him and hanged Him on the common
gibbet_ a bloody, dusty, sweaty and sordid business.''
 &HT;    Jesus diedbetrayed, tortured and executed. Evil, violent and
maliciously slow. ``He descended to the dead,'' says the ancient
creed. The winter of faith.
 &HT;    Christian tradition proclaims that ``on the third day he rose
again.'' To us, three days seem so short, but to Jesus' followers
it must have seemed as forever. They did not expect resurrection.
Their friend and teacher was dead. They_ especially his mother _
must have been nearly paralyzed by fear and grief from the sudden
violence of his death.
 &HT;    Columbine recalls that ancient suffering while reminding us of
death's wasteland and the agony of healing. Resurrections do not
happen quickly. Nor do they arrive on the cue of the calendar, on
yearly anniversaries, or while reporters are watching.
 &HT;    Healing comes in fits and starts as unexpectedly as spring.
Christian tradition proclaims that new life emerges only from the
darkness of the earthjust as the fragile blades of grass make their
way through frosty soil toward light.
 &HT;    We would prefer an instant miracle, jumping over suffering into
eternal life. But it just does not happen that way. Not even for
God. Easter faith does not avoid pain. It only recognizes that
somewhere, sometime, in some unexpected way, pain will recede in
the gentle grace of God's love.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: McCain flip-flops, folds flag
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain went to South Carolina Wednesday to say the
Confederate battle flag ``should be removed'' from atop the
Statehouse. He also said he compromised his principles in not
saying so earlier, when the question was a major issue during the
state's Republican primary in February. McCain and George W. Bush
said then they thought it was up to the people of South Carolina
alone to decide. Wednesday, McCain said, ``I feared that if I
answered honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary. So I
chose to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always
tell the truth.'' He still lost to Bush. At the time, McCain had
said that his ancestors had ``fought honorably'' on the side of the
Confederacy. Today he said, they had ``fought on the wrong side of
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   SO NEW YORK WOULD BECOME LIKE OTHER STATES?
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Senate approved a plan that would knock down
the state's notorious barriers to putting candidates on the
Republican presidential primary ballot, and would make the primary
a winner-take-all contest. Candidates would get on the ballot if
they raise at least $5,000 in each of 20 states; are certified with
the state elections board as being a nationally recognized and
serious candidate; or collect 5,000 signatures from New Yorkers.
The state Assembly is expected to pass the bill. Republican Gov.
George Pataki, who proposed the changes, had tried to use the
complex access rules to exclude everyone but George W. Bush. A
federal judge eventually opened the ballot to John McCain and other
GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONABLE DONATIONS IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign said Wednesday it will
return a $22,000 donation from a businesswoman linked by
congressional investigators to a drug trafficker. The donation was
made by Vivian Mannerud, whose Airline Brokers Co. runs charter
flights between Cuba and Miami. Mannerud has been linked to drug
smuggler Jorge Cabrera, who made a $20,000 contribution to the
Democratic National Committee in 1995 from a bank account in which
he kept profits from drug trafficking. Clinton's opponent, Rudy
Giuliani, also faced similar questions Wednesday. The New York
Times and Newsday reported that the mayor's campaign committee
received a $100,000 donation from the Renco Group, whose holdings
include Utah-based Magnesium Corporation of America, identified by
the Environmental Protection Agency in 1998 as the nation's top
dumper of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   SQUEEZING OFF A GUN CONTROL ROUND
</P>
<P>
   To mark the first anniversary of the shootings at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., Al Gore is going to Bergen County,
N.J., today to press for gun control and safe-school initiatives.
Gore will visit Fort Lee High School, near the George Washington
Bridge. Gore is hoping, according to ABC, that his gun control
message will strike a chord in New Jersey, considered an election
day swing state. Gore's staff said Fort Lee High was picked because
of student leaders' efforts to emphasize school safety. ``This is a
school and a community that have been in the forefront of combating
school violence,'' said campaign spokesman Peter Ragone.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING TO THE FAVORITE IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said he would consider offering the No. 2 spot on
the GOP ticket to John McCain. At a press conference in Michigan,
where McCain bested Bush in the primary, Bush said, ``I know he's
said he's not interested, but until I talk to him and find out how
interested or not interested he is, I'll give him consideration.''
Said McCain spokesman Todd Harris : ``Talk like this is always
flattering whether it's from Governor Bush or Jesse Ventura.
However, Senator McCain has made it more than clear that he is not
interested in being vice president.'' Still, the topic may come up
on May 9 in Philadelphia when they have their first face-to-face
meeting since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTION COPS SEE DRESS REHEARSAL
</P>
<P>
   When protesters shut down parts of Washington this week, police
from Los Angeles and Philadelphia were there taking notes. They
hoped the visit would help them prepare for this summer's
Democratic and Republican national conventions _ and learn how to
prevent the kind of violence and vandalism by demonstrators that
marred the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in December.
Philadelphia police said pepper spray and nightsticks would be used
judiciously _ and only if protesters assault police, resist arrest
or charge barricades. All Los Angeles police officers' vacations
and days off during the mid-August Democratic convention have been
canceled, and the officers are undergoing special training.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WWW. LAUGHS AT W.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission has dismissed a complaint filed
by George W. Bush's campaign committee against a parody Web site.
The FEC said it would rather spend its limited resources
investigating more significant complaints. At issue was a parody
Web site posted by Zack Exley of Somerville, Mass., who satirized
Bush's presidential bid. The home page, for example, features a
campaign logo with the slogan, ``All grown up now.'' Another page
proclaims, ``Hypocrisy with bravado.'' Bush complained about the
Web site last May, calling Exley ``just a garbage man.'' You can
find the Web site at www.gwbush.com _ pretty close to Bush's own
www.georgewbush.com.
</P>
<P>
   WAKING UP FROM THE DREAMWORKS
</P>
<P>
   The news that Hollywood's most prominent Democratic fund-raisers
_ DreamWorks founders Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey
Katzenberg _ plan a break from hosting the glitzy affairs after
November's election may be a sign the industry is reaching its
donor saturation point. ``Donors are getting tired of it. These are
true-blue Democratic donors. You just cannot keep saying `yes'
forever,'' said Larry Makinson, director of the Center for
Responsive Politics. ``I think they may be the first, but they're
not going to be the last.'' Said DreamWorks spokesman Andy Spahn:
``Every political candidate in the country from city council on up
to White House aspirants is likely to call us, write us, ask for a
meeting looking for support, looking for help. It is nonstop, it is
year-round every year. It is a system run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   SILICON VALLEY FERTILE FOR CASH
</P>
<P>
   In the hunt for campaign cash, the Democratic Party is looking
to the high-tech sector, an industry at odds with traditional party
allies such as labor unions and trial lawyers on some key issues.
Republicans hope to use the split to hinder Democratic high-tech
industry fund-raising, but Silicon Valley, unlike most business
groups, has divided its loyalties between the two parties. Computer
companies have made $8.5 million in campaign contributions since
Jan. 1, 1999, according to an Associated Press computer analysis.
These companies donated more than the $8.1 million in 1997-98.
While most business groups lean Republican, more than half of the
high-tech money has gone to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   RESIGNATION HIGHLIGHTS REFORM PARTY RIFT
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's press secretary resigned, signaling a
widening rift between presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan and allies
of party founder Ross Perot. ``I think she resigned because she
feels that the Buchanan campaign is attempting to take over the
party and is preventing her from being able to do her job,'' said
party secretary Jim Mangia. Donna Donovan will remain chairman of
the Connecticut Reform Party and active in other leadership roles,
Mangia said. Donovan declined to comment, but her resignation is to
take effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan opened a three-week effort to collect the 56,000
petition signatures necessary to appear on Texas ballots as an
independent. Meanwhile, the Reform Party, whose presidential
nomination Buchanan is seeking, is conducting a separate petition
drive to ensure that their candidate, if not Buchanan, also is
listed. ``(Buchanan's) probably just trying to play it safe,'' said
Elizabeth Hanshaw, director of the Texas secretary of state's legal
division. ``You can't appear twice on the ballot, so if he gets the
Reform Party nomination he would probably just withdraw as an
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERACTIVE PLATFORMS
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is breathing new life into political party
platforms, those long, dry-as-dust documents that in the past often
went unread _ even by the presidential candidates themselves. Two
weeks ago, Cox News Service's Andrew J. Glass reports, Al Gore
launched a plan that lets anybody draft a plank online for the
upcoming party platform. By Tuesday, more than 2,000 people had
done so and received ``personalized'' thank-you letters from Gore
and Democratic national Chairman Joe Andrew. Speakout.com, a
for-profit site, supplies sophisticated software that lets users
easily cut, paste and edit parts of the 1996 Democratic platform to
create their own 2000 version. Jim Nicholson, the GOP chairman, has
bought into a more modest set of interactive tools from the same
site, including chat rooms, surveys and e-mail messages to
candidates and other political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   THEY AIN'T JUST WHISTLING `DIXIE'
</P>
<P>
   Defying the NAACP's tourism boycott of South Carolina, the newly
formed Southern Party will hold its national convention June 30 and
July 1 in Charleston. ``Please join us in the marvelous festivities
we are putting together to celebrate the rebirth of the South's
political effort to regain independence and self determination
through the ballot box,'' the party announced on its Web site,
www.southernparty.org. Among the party's aims are ``to defend the
proud heritage of Dixie from attack,'' with the ultimate goal of
``a free and independent Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH RAMPS UP, GORE GEARS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Sounding almost like a Democrat, Republican George W. Bush
unveils an education agenda one day, headline-grabbing health care
and environmental initiatives the next, an affordable-housing plan
after that. But where's Al Gore? It may seem as though the real
Democrat in the race is taking a nap during this springtime lull in
the campaign. But Gore put his policy proposals on the table months
ago. And after one splashy misstep in the Elian Gonzalez firestorm,
Gore is executing a low-watt strategy to gain consistency for his
message, cash for his party, and a homespun shine to his public
image. Gore's schedule these days is dominated by almost daily fund
raising _ with severely restricted press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY GAP IN PENNSYLVANIA
</P>
<P>
   For months, Democrats have believed that Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., was one of the more vulnerable targets in their bid to
recapture control of the Senate. But the Democratic nominee, Rep.
Ron Klink, a moderate from the Pittsburgh area, won a very costly
victory in his party's primary. Klink's treasury is saddled with
more than $446,000 in debts and he has only $119,000 in the bank,
according to the latest Federal Election Commission records.
Because Santorum faced no opposition in the Republican primary, he
enjoys an enormous financial edge. He's raised $6 million and has
more than $3.7 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   FEINSTEIN'S OPPONENT THIS TIME NOT AS RICH
</P>
<P>
   For months, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has held an
overwhelming lead in the polls over her Republican challenger, Rep.
Tom Campbell, and in the latest fund-raising period, she collected
nearly twice as much money. From Feb. 17 through the end of March,
Feinstein took in $988,000 and spent about $360,000. All told, she
had about $2.2 million in cash on hand. By contrast, Campbell
reported raising $565,000 in the latest period, and spent almost
$700,000, leaving him with $615,000 in his war chest. In
Feinstein's last race, in 1994, her opponent, Michael Huffington,
spent $26 million, much of it his own money, and she spent less
than $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ONE BY THE WAYSIDE IN NEBRASKA
</P>
<P>
   One of five candidates for the GOP nomination for retiring
Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat dropped out of the race. Dr.
Elliott Rustad, 66, was a distant second in the Republican field
behind state Attorney General Don Stenberg, according to his
polling. ``In order to win I would have to wage a (negative)
campaign that could divide the Republican Party and that I'm not
willing to do,'' he said. Rustad's decision narrows the GOP field,
but not by much. Stenberg, agribusinessman David Hergert, Secretary
of State Scott Moore and former state Sen. John DeCamp are still in
it. Ex-Gov. Ben Nelson is the likely Democratic nominee.

 &HT;    Bush's fuss about Internet page draws more negative light than
site
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Dubya made a big mistake when he sicced his guard
dogs onto New Yorker Zack Exley, who launched a Web site named
gwbush.com.
</P>
<P>
   Exley is no Bush fan. He grabbed up the gwbush domain name, paid
his registration fee and built a Web page that does its best to
trash the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a lot of people searching for the authentic George W.
Bush Web campaign page (georgewbush.com) will be drawn to Exley's
anti-Bush Web page.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this is what Exley, a computer consultant, had in mind
when he registered his gwbush.com Web page that announces ``George
W. Bush For President'' and then goes on to parody and skewer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By publicly complaining about Exley's Web site and filing an
official objection to the site with the Federal Election
Commission, Bush managed to send many thousands of viewers to
Exley's Web site who quite naturally wanted to see what all the
fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   Now the FEC has dismissed the official Bush complaint because
the commission has bigger fish to fry. The commission doesn't want
to waste valuable bureaucratic time on such a low priority issue.
</P>
<P>
   FEC officials really didn't want to rule on the Bush complaint.
Bureaucrats don't last long in Washington by sticking their necks
out, even if they stand up for something as basic as freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   After all, like everyone else, the bureaucrats heard Bush
explain his opposition to Exley's Web site by telling reporters,
``There ought to be limits to freedom.'' Anyone willing to limit
freedom might also be willing to limit bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   To show what a big mistake it was to complain about gwbush.com,
Bush's remark about limiting freedom sent more thousands of people
in search of the Web page. Now the remark appears on bumper
stickers and T-shirts sold on the Web site along with other
anti-Bush paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well that the FEC punted on the Bush complaint
because the agency has shown a tendency to crack down on citizens
who post Web pages in order to express their political opinions,
either for or against specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC has warned that if citizens spend enough money building
Web pages that support or oppose political candidates, then those
people might be required to register as political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the agency ruled that a Web site that supported a
Connecticut congressional candidate should be treated as a campaign
expenditure for committing the sin of urging voters to support a
specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That may be what Bush had in mind when he said there ought to be
limits on freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for Congress to limit the free flow of unlimited
cash that currently pours into the coffers of the major political
parties _ a campaign reform idea that Bush opposes _ and quite
another thing to limit a private person's expression of his own
political opinions in support or opposition of specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush or FEC bureaucrats are really worried about corruption
of America's electoral process, they should oppose unlimited soft
money donations from wealthy special-interest corporations, unions
and others that distort the principle of one-person, one-vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Internet is like a giant soap box.
Everyone is free to stand on their Internet soap box and spout off.
It's a global marketplace of ideas, facts, distortions and
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it's free.
</P>
<P>
   The gwbush.com Web site is a thorn in the candidate's side. The
barb would not be in so deep, nor would it be so infected, had Bush
ignored it. Self-inflicted wounds are always a big mistake.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    One year since Columbine. With the passing months, those of us
far from the tragedy have thought of it less often than in those
first few terrible weeks following the rampage. But for those close
to the shooting _ especially the friends and parents of the slain
teenagers_ this must have been an unspeakably painful year.
 &HT;    This week, as thousands of reporters and pilgrims converged to
mark the anniversary of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's assault,
most locals were leaving town to escape the gaze of national
voyeurism into their private grief.
 &HT;    The reporters and the curious did not necessarily want to
recount the awful details of the killings. They wanted to know
about the healing. Has death brought resurrection to Columbine? A
year has passed. Perhaps Columbine is normal again.
 &HT;    But on a recent ``Nightline,'' ABC's John Donovan reported that
healing is slow and sometimes nonexistent. Anger, rage and despair
are still palpable. During the last year, the people of Littleton,
Colo., have experienced more death: Strange suicides and murders
have riddled the community around the high school.
 &HT;    For those of us who embrace Christianity, this grisly
anniversary parallels another tragic commemoration: Holy Week and
its culmination in Easter. On Thursday, as we marked the memorial
of Columbine, millions also marked the memorial of Jesus' last meal
with his disciples.
 &HT;    In both, unexpected betrayal led to murder of innocents.
Interlaced violence and deathcenturies apartyet undeserved,
unexpected and unwelcome.
 &HT;    This year's eerie correspondence between Columbine and Easter
point toward a discomforting aspect of our national character: We
want quick resurrections. American Christianity has never
emphasized Holy Week _ a supposedly morbid exercise in churchgoing
best left to Lutherans, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics. Most
American Christians ignore Tenebrae (the service of ``darkness''),
Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday in favor of Easter
celebration.
 &HT;    We celebrate life,not death. We skip the hard part.
 &HT;    If we skip the hard part, however, Easter quickly devolves into
a sentimental celebration of spring_ a sort of demi-Christmas with
a 6-foot bunny who seems cheap in comparison to Santa. But we
prefer it that way. Cute baby chicks and new church clothes delude
us into thinking that faith is an eternal spring.
 &HT;    After all, Christians are called an ``Easter people.'' The
Resurrection is the basis of Christian belief. Why dwell on the bad
stuff that comes before?
 &HT;    The answer is quite simple: Without death, there can be no
resurrection. Winter always comes before spring.
 &HT;    Perhaps Columbine is a spiritual national winter _a long, cold,
unrelenting winter. The kind of winter people in Minnesota and the
Dakotas know. The darkness breaks, the snow melts, and days of
sunshine bring forth daffodils and tulips. It is over!
 &HT;    Then, from nowhere, a blizzard closes in as if it were once
again December. Will spring ever come? Will it ever end?
 &HT;    Holy Week is much the same. Of its shocking events, the mystery
writer Dorothy Sayers once said, ``God was executed by people
painfully like us, in a society very similar to our own.He was
executed by a corrupt church, a timid politician and a fickle
proletariat led by professional agitators. His executioners made
vulgar jokes about Him, called Him filthy names, taunted Him,
smacked Him in the face, flogged Him and hanged Him on the common
gibbet_ a bloody, dusty, sweaty and sordid business.''
 &HT;    Jesus diedbetrayed, tortured and executed. Evil, violent and
maliciously slow. ``He descended to the dead,'' says the ancient
creed. The winter of faith.
 &HT;    Christian tradition proclaims that ``on the third day he rose
again.'' To us, three days seem so short, but to Jesus' followers
it must have seemed as forever. They did not expect resurrection.
Their friend and teacher was dead. They_ especially his mother _
must have been nearly paralyzed by fear and grief from the sudden
violence of his death.
 &HT;    Columbine recalls that ancient suffering while reminding us of
death's wasteland and the agony of healing. Resurrections do not
happen quickly. Nor do they arrive on the cue of the calendar, on
yearly anniversaries, or while reporters are watching.
 &HT;    Healing comes in fits and starts as unexpectedly as spring.
Christian tradition proclaims that new life emerges only from the
darkness of the earthjust as the fragile blades of grass make their
way through frosty soil toward light.
 &HT;    We would prefer an instant miracle, jumping over suffering into
eternal life. But it just does not happen that way. Not even for
God. Easter faith does not avoid pain. It only recognizes that
somewhere, sometime, in some unexpected way, pain will recede in
the gentle grace of God's love.

AS WEB USE EXPANDS WORLDWIDE, TRANSLATION SOFTWARE MUST ADJUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of the Internet as the ultimate global village _ the
medium that will allow people around the world to connect and
communicate _ may be facing its ultimate test. As the community of
non-English speaking people online grows, companies are racing to
support the numerous languages of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics of the Internet are changing fast. Non-English
speakers make up nearly half of the online population, researchers
say. As a result, companies are looking for ways to allow these
Netizens to communicate in their native tongues. One of the
obstacles to achieving that goal has been the limited state of
machine translation services and multilingual communication tools.
</P>
<P>
   Based on international polls and census information, Global
Reach, a technology research firm in San Francisco, estimates that
128 million of the almost 280 million people who use the Internet
speak languages other than English. Jupiter Communications, a
technology research group in New York City, estimates that the
number of non-English speakers will surpass English speakers in
2001. Jupiter estimates that online households in Europe and on the
Pacific Rim will more than double by 2002. In response to this
international boom, companies like Yahoo!, Amazon and eToys have
created local versions of their sites that include specialized
information in the appropriate language. But these customized sites
are in the minority. Jupiter reports that fewer than one-third of
major online companies have localized sites for their international
customers. With the increased globalization of Web denizens,
companies are improving and developing software to meet growing
demands for translation services.
</P>
<P>
   Machine translation, introduced in the 1950s, has become one of
the more common ways of breaking down the language barriers online.
In December 1997, the AltaVista search portal introduced a popular
version of machine translation for the World Wide Web. Called
Babelfish _ a term used by Douglas Adams, the author of ``The
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,'' to describe an imagined
universal translation device _ AltaVista's service
(http://world.altavista.com/) translates text between 13 language
pairs, including English to French, Italian to English, and German
to French. To use the site, visitors type or cut and paste text
into a window, select the appropriate language pair and click on a
button for a quick and easy translation.
</P>
<P>
   Many surfers have made sport of trading the sometimes comical
results of translation devices. In one popular example, ``Melts in
your mouth, not in your hands'' becomes, in French, ``Fontes dans
votre bouche, pas dans des vos mains.'' But, when translated back
into English, the phrase becomes: ``Pig iron and cast iron in your
mouth, not in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the developers of the software see the problem. They often
refer to their work as ``gist'' translations, automated conversions
that, at best, let the user know the main thrust of a particular
bit of text from an e-mail, word-processing document or Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Creating effective machine translation software requires a
formidable effort. Lernout and Hauspie, a Belgium-based developer
of speech and language technologies employs a staff of linguists
and lexicographers from 18 countries. Systems are designed
according to language pairs. The company has 15 pairs and is
working to add others, but developing just one pair of languages _
Korean and Chinese, for example _ can take up to 18 months, said
Jeff Hopkins, vice president of engineering for L&AMP;H.
</P>
<P>
   First, Hopkins said, lexicographers translate words and
structures according to the rules of the target language, deciding,
for example, what is a verb and what is a noun. Next, they connect
words in appropriate pairs. Then the selected words are rearranged
according to the rules of the target language. The process is
nearly instantaneous, and, almost always, is less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we're trying to model the human brain,'' Hopkins
said, ``and since no one really knows how the brain works, no one
knows how to truly model it.''
</P>
<P>
   While engineers try to solve this problem, translation companies
like L&AMP;H and the French company Systran are trying to customize
their gist services. L&AMP;H's iTranslator Enterprise is specialized
for medical, legal and business languages. Like L&AMP;H, Systran offers
customized services to corporate customers who would like
translation software tailored to their particular business needs.
``If a visitor comes to their site and can't communicate,'' said
Denis Gachout, Systran's president, ``then that site is
increasingly going to lose sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving customers a means to communicate is the most recent step
in the evolution of the multilingual Web. Because of the limits of
most PC keyboards and machine translation sites, it has been
difficult, if not impossible, for non-English speakers who do not
use the Roman alphabet to, say, compose e-mails or post messages on
a Web site in their own languages.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail programs of Microsoft and Yahoo allow users to
receive messages in a handful of languages, but require special
software. Now, competing start-ups have created free software that
allows users to quickly and easily type in non-Roman characters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Umair Khan, the 30-year-old founder of eGlyphs Inc.
(www.eglyphs.com), a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., that
specializes in multilingual applications, devised such a program
after he found that could not send e-mails to other Pakistanis.
Three years ago, Khan, a former Intel engineer, developed a Web
site that allowed people to communicate with each other in Urdu.
</P>
<P>
   The success of that site led to the Everymail.com last November.
Everymail, an onscreen virtual keyboard program, allows users to
type characters in 34 languages including Thai, Icelandic and
Vietnamese. To type, users either click each letter with the mouse
or type with matching keys on the keyboard. Similar programs expand
these services into other communication areas online _ Everychat,
for chat, and Everyforum, for message boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our offerings share one goal,'' Khan said, ``to let you go
on the Web and start immediately typing in your own language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jerusalem company, Slangsoft.com, has developed similar
technology that allows Internet surfers to interact with any Web
site in a choice of 42 languages. The software, called Emule, uses
the Java programming code so that users can instantaneously
communicate in the languages without having to download special
fonts or large plug-in files.
</P>
<P>
   Like Everymail, Emule creates a virtual keyboard with customized
language characters. The Emule technology is in use on sites like
AltaVista and Looksmart.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, like Tegic and Zi Corp., are developing
multilingual text-input programs, and companies are also working to
bring their services to wireless devices like cellular phones and
personal digital assistants. Lernout and Hauspie's iTranslator
Wireless is available for users of the Palm VII digital organizer.
Like the desktop version, the iTranslator Wireless language pairs
include English and French, English and German, and Spanish and
French.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific tops profit predictions
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific Group easily beat estimates for
first-quarter earnings, thanks in part to soaring prices in the
pulp and paper business.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Group said Wednesday that first-quarter profit
nearly doubled to $194 million, or $1.11 a share, compared with
year-ago profit of $99 million, or 56 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded by nudging Georgia-Pacific's stock up 18
3/4 cents to $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Group was expected to earn $1.02 a share, based
on a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the first quarter jumped 60 percent to $5.38 billion,
up from $3.35 billion, boosted by last summer's acquisition of
paper distributor Unisource Worldwide. Unisource, the nation's
largest distributor of paper products and janitorial supplies,
contributed $1.73 billion in revenue during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand for paper is strong as the Asian markets continue
to recover. And that's pushing prices up. Prices for some paper
grades jumped more than 35 percent over the past year, while prices
for the pulp used to make paper surged 40 percent, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific is the world's second-largest supplier of pulp,
behind Weyerhaeuser.
</P>
<P>
   Most major players in forest products surpassed expectations for
the first quarter. International Paper, Champion International,
Boise Cascade and Weyerhaeuser all recently reported profits that
easily beat estimates. Mead was the exception with an earnings
report on Wednesday that fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Strong paper markets helped to boost profit all around.
Georgia-Pacific's pulp and paper business had a 10-fold increase in
operating profit, to $129 million. The paper distribution business
reported operating profit of $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's containerboard and packaging segment posted a
sharp increase in first-quarter operating profit, to $131 million
from $35 million one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lower prices for plywood and lumber, though, dragged down profit
in other segments. Georgia-Pacific's building products business had
a sharp decrease in operating profit to $191 million, against $248
million.
</P>
<P>
   And the distribution segment of the building products business
reported operating profit of $14 million in the first quarter, down
from $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s timber business also
reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. posted net income of $40 million, or 49 cents a
share, compared with $47 million, or 54 cents a share, in the
year-ago period. Timber Co. was expected to earn 46 cents a share,
according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was $102 million against $141 million.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. shares closed Wednesday at $24.43, up 93 cents.

&HT;     SURVEY FINDS PARENTS ARE KEY TO HALTING SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year after the nation's worst outbreak of school
violence, most Americans believe that parents _ not school
officials _ bear responsibility for preventing future campus
tragedies, according to a survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the survey said the findings underscore that the
shootings at Columbine High School in suburban Denver last April 20
``shape the way parents and non-parents alike view the issue of
school violence.'' About 71 percent of parents surveyed said the
attack has colored their perceptions of school safety.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,000 adults, including 283 parents, was conducted
by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Some 85 percent of respondents said parents are responsible for
raising their children not to commit violence while only 9 percent
said the responsibility rests with teachers and counselors at
schools.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why kids commit such violence, a plurality of
respondents, 42 percent, placed the blame squarely on poor
parenting, while 26 percent cited violence in the media that
children are exposed to and 14 percent singled out peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 percent of respondents with children felt that their
kids were ``very safe'' at school, and 50 percent rated schools
only ``somewhat safe.'' However, 17 percent of parents said schools
were downright dangerous places and that there have been ``serious
threats of violence'' involving children at their own local
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted April 12 _16.
</P>
<P>
   Around lunchtime last April 20, Columbine students Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, both armed with automatic weapons and
explosives, began a terrifying rampage that ended when they shot
themselves after fatally shooting 12 students and one teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the attack at Columbine, other recent school
shootings have drawn national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a teenager opened fire with a rifle, wounding six
classmates in Conyers, Ga. In December, a 13-year-old student
opened fire at a middle school in Fort Gibson, Okla. In February, a
6-year-old was accused of fatally shooting a classmate in Mount
Morris Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Columbine, President Clinton and some members of
Congress have been pushing for new gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey found that most Americans continue to support gun
control _ nearly two-thirds of respondents said gun restrictions
are more important to uphold and enforce than the rights of gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also found that Americans are not convinced that
additional gun control measures would lessen overall violent crime.
In fact, in a separate survey of 1,184 adults by the Pew Research
Center in March, a majority _ 59 percent _ said it was more
important that law enforcement officials enforce existing gun
control laws than to enact new ones.

 &HT;    Plain or fancy, symbol of southern hospitality always has a
place on holiday tables
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sand may not be the best addition to a coconut cake, but it's
the one I remember best.
</P>
<P>
   Orange-tinted, the cake was sprinkled with dried flakes and
wrapped in crinkly cellophane, purchased hurriedly at a grocery
near the beach. And it was enough to make me feel mighty special.
</P>
<P>
   If you're as big a coconut-lover as I have been since before
that fifth birthday, any time a coconut cake appears ... well,
nothing is going to mar the occasion _ not even a stinging
windstorm that blows it full of sand. You will eat it anyway, grit
and all, feeling lucky indeed even if it is store-bought.
</P>
<P>
   But if someone makes you a coconut cake, now that is the royal
treatment. Not only are they catering to your fancy, they are
tackling a cake that is not the easiest or quickest to make. I have
heard of coconut cakes that take eight days to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know somebody loves you if they make you a coconut cake,''
says Nathalie Dupree, standing in her Social Circle kitchen
revising a relatively quick scratch version for her next cookbook.
It takes just over an hour from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend and employee for almost 30 years, Kate Almand,
presides over a pot of gurgling, gritslike goo that she will gently
pat onto the still-warm layers.
</P>
<P>
   Every Christmas, Almand cracks a few coconuts to make two cakes
and freezes some of the liquid and grated meat for birthdays and
Easter, when tinted green flakes hide jelly bean eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut sales peak around holidays. Baker's Coconut says its
sales at Easter follow only Thanksgiving and Christmas, and sales
are consistently strongest in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners have embraced the coconut palm seed pods since they
were used as ballast on ships during the Civil War and unloaded
cheaply. It didn't take long to transform them into a symbol of
Southern hospitality at its grandest _ a feathery white cake
sitting on a crystal stand, a slice nearby on a bone china dessert
plate flanked by an ornate silver fork and starched linen napkin.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants, too _ from the homey to the tony _ like to set out
the old-fashioned favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Day, Easter and Christmas are peaks for Emma Bridges'
coconut cake at Historic Green Manor in Union City. Her whipped
cream and sour cream cake is in the top three every day, but on
special occasions soars to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Barbara Green said out-of-state customers call ahead to
make sure there will be some on the buffet table.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges doesn't remember where she got her recipe, but said her
grandmother had a cake on the table every Sunday. As she's
developed the recipe, Bridges said she's come to prefer frozen
coconut but has made the cake in a pinch with a mix and dried
flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Levy, an Atlanta food stylist and writer, adores coconut
cake so much, she confesses that she sometimes goes to Capri
Italian American Cafe in Tucker and orders a bowl of soup and slice
of coconut cake as her meal.
</P>
<P>
   For this article, she tested the ultra-extravagant version from
Carroll Street Bakery in Cabbagetown to fulfill a reader's request
for the recipe _ and proclaimed it the best, bar none, she's ever
tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heart attack on a plate, but what a way to go,'' she
sighed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far less experienced baker Dupree is aiming for while
revising the recipe from her ``New Southern Cooking'' published in
1986. Changes include describing the coconut that shoppers may
encounter in stores, stressing using coconut and liquid drained
from a whole coconut and adding to the icing's cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to cook it (the icing) till it makes an almost vulgar
sound,'' Dupree says. Butter and sugar won't be ``creamed,''
they'll be ``stirred,'' a concession to new bakers who didn't grow
up around somebody like Almand, who makes a cake of some kind every
week.
</P>
<P>
   With three children, 10 grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren, Almand, 74, has tried lots of recipes for
special-occasion cakes and observed preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most little ones like a chocolate cake better than anything,''
says Almand, who has often seen tastes turn when the kids reach
their teens and embrace her own favorite _ her coconut cake. This
is not the pristine white cake with fluffy Seven-Minute Icing many
think of as the Southern standard. Nor does it go for a wider
audience with additions like pineapple or lemon filling or cream
cheese or whipped cream frosting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cake is a nothing cake, really. But it's a perfect foil
for the coconut,'' Dupree says, claiming it's best after sitting
three days but rarely lasts through one.
</P>
<P>
   Almand and Dupree both believe it's best to start with a whole
coconut, draining and straining the liquid and grating the meat.
But they test it with substitutes more likely to be used by readers
_ canned ``lite'' coconut milk and fresh frozen unsweetened grated
coconut. Dried packaged or canned flakes or shreds may be
acceptable on some other cakes with ``a little more personality on
their own,'' Dupree says.
</P>
<P>
   After they've considered a range of options and coconut products
they agree: This is the one to make for a coconut-cake lover.
</P>
<P>
   Proof is in the first warm bite.

 &HT;    Slam-dunk movies to stay ahead of game
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With March Madness over, what's a round ball fan to do? Well,
you could check out ``Love and Basketball,'' a new movie starring
Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan that opens Friday in metro Atlanta. Or
you could hold your own video Final Four at home. Here are a few
ideas, some more hoop-centric than others:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hoop Dreams.'' This extraordinary documentary may be the
finest film ever made about basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert have
delivered a movie that's about far more than backboards and
rebounds. They've served up a richly observed, superbly nuanced
slice of the American dream as they follow the hopes, hard work and
heartbreak that dog two inner-city phenoms as they struggle to make
it to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Agee and William Gates are 14 when we meet them. Both
have grown up on the rubble-strewn, drug-littered courts of
inner-city Chicago. Both have exceptional ability that gets them
recruited by a tony suburban high school. From there, it's a matter
of luck, timing and true-life unpredictability. This marvelous film
scores a slam-dunk by showing us the rules of the game on and off
the court.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hoosiers'': The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this
movie about the little Indiana team that could, but the impact is
undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1951, and Gene Hackman is the new coach in a hick
burg, looking for a second chance for himself and a state
championship for his underdog team. The film captures a time when
high school sports was about playing the game, not college
recruiting, drug tests and no pass-no play.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hopper managed a best supporting actor nomination for his
role as a former high school star offered a position as Hackman's
assistant coach if he can stay off booze. He later joked that he
and Hackman couldn't understand why the filmmakers kept shooting
``all those damned basketball games. We were sitting on these
wooden benches saying, `Here's the big money. Why aren't you
shooting us?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``He Got Game'': Spike Lee shows us the money and the groupies
and the cars and the rent-free digs and the
anything-your-heart-desires temptations routinely dangled in front
of hot, young high school prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures on these young Nike endorsers in the making
are only part of the story. There's also an acutely observed
father-son relationship in which a jailbird father (a wonderful
Denzel Washington) is made an unusual offer by his warden (Ned
Beatty): If he can convince his son, a budding star from the
projects (Ray Allen, whose real job is playing for the Milwaukee
Bucks), to sign with the governor's alma mater, he'll get a reduced
sentence. One not so small problem: Father and son have been
bitterly estranged for years.
</P>
<P>
   Look for some cameos by real-life players and coaches, including
Georgia Tech's gone-but-never-forgotten Bobby Cremins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Forget Paris'': Most of you have probably forgotten there
ever was a movie named ``Forget Paris,'' and if you do remember it,
you've almost certainly forgotten that it had anything at all to do
with basketball.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was really more of a romance about what happened
after Billy (Crystal) met Debra (Winger). But Crystal, who also
directed, let his passion for basketball seep through by making his
character an NBA referee. It not only gave him a chance to hang out
with some of his idols but taught him something about being a ref.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes them,'' he told an interviewer. ``The best thing
you can say about a referee is nothing. That means he did a good
job.''

 &HT;    South's gift: Country ham
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yumiko Baron, by all reports, is not one to shy away
from a culinary adventure. A chef in Boulder, Colo., she didn't
flinch one bit when her husband brought home a country ham, even
though she had no clue how to prepare it. She studied up and set
about baking.
</P>
<P>
   Then she called South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the directions and I soaked it for nearly a day,''
Baron told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's fine,'' I replied. (Soaking times can vary; some
skip it and scrub the skin instead.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I baked it in the oven,'' she went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I said. (Some boil it, but most don't have a pot that
big, so oven steaming is the way to go.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's very, very salty,'' Baron said next. ``And kind of
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I exclaimed. ``You've got country ham!''
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause. ``Well, what do I do with it now?'' Baron
asked.
</P>
<P>
   For the unaccustomed, I suppose country ham is an acquired taste
much like the sushi from Baron's home country of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the South, ham that is dry-cured with salt and aged
is worth a celebration, especially this time of year when the fall
hams have had time to put on six months of flavor. It's no wonder
country hams have been a part of post-Lenten celebrations for ages.
There's nothing restrained about its toothsome-chewy texture and
lusty-salty taste.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in western Kentucky, I came to adore the neighbors
who offered country hams as holiday gifts. Now, I always stop by
Broadbent's in Cadiz on my way to Kuttawa. Or I search out the
packs of Clifty Farms ``biscuit cuts'' (small slices) in the meat
department of area grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Split biscuit sandwiches are the best way to enjoy country ham,
as I explained to Baron. I prefer a palm-size, soft and tender
biscuit to pair with thick, chewy ham slices. The ladies in
Louisville slice thinly and serve with silver-dollar-size beaten
biscuits, which are crackerlike and not to my liking.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond biscuits and breakfast, ``even the tiniest sliver of
country ham contributes rich flavor to a simple dish,'' explains
Marietta resident Elaine J. Harvell and her co-author Jeanne Voltz
in ``The Country Ham Book'' (University of North Carolina Press,
$16.95).
</P>
<P>
   For country ham lovers and novices alike, this book is a must.
Harvell and Voltz offer ham history, personal history and a hog's
worth of ideas for using country ham, from seasoning greens to
slicing paper-thin and serving with grilled figs.
</P>
<P>
   Below is the recipe for the classic country ham sidekick _
red-eye gravy _ from Harvell's book. Inside(bottom of page),
there's a source list and a divine recipe for country ham and sage
bread. You'll want to make it for Easter brunch I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   red-eye gravy
</P>
<P>
   Fry small, thin pieces of ham in a heavy skillet until browned,
adding a bit of oil if the ham is very lean. Keep the fried ham
pieces warm. Skim off some of the fat, but not too much because the
bubble of fat is the ``red eye.'' Pour 1/2 cup or so of hot coffee
or hot water in the pan over medium heat. Boil a minute or two and
scrape up the brown bits. You'll have an excellent sauce for
biscuits, grits or rice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   I first made this bread (a Barbara Kafka recipe) last spring,
and since then it has held its place as my all-time favorite
homemade bread. I served it throughout the spring, at my Fourth of
July brunch and again during fall vacation on Jekyll Island. When
it bakes, it fills the house with the most savory aroma. Hot from
the oven, slice and butter. The next day, make toast or the world's
best grilled cheese sandwich.

</P>
<P>
   Country Ham and Sage Bread
</P>
<P>
   Makes 16 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Rising time: 2 hours, 40 minutes
Cooking time: 50-60 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 package active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sage leaves, thinly sliced crosswise and then finely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for oiling
</P>
<P>
   rolling pin and pan
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces country ham, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   (about 1 1/2 cups)
</P>
<P>
   Pour 3/4 cup warm water into a medium mixing bowl and sprinkle
yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until top of
water is covered with a beige foam. Stir in the sage, olive oil and
1 cup of flour until smooth. Stir in salt and remaining flour,
until flour is absorbed and dough comes together in a ball around
the spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Turn dough out onto a work surface. With lightly floured hands,
knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Shape into a
ball. Place in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil.
Cover with a clean kitchen towel and place in a warm spot for 1
hour or until doubled in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil a rolling pin. Turn dough out onto work surface and
roll into a 11-inch square. Place half the ham dice over the dough
in a diamond pattern; the points of the diamond should be at the
midpoints of the sides of the dough square.
</P>
<P>
   Take the corners of the dough and fold them in so that they meet
at the center of the dough square. Pinch dough together to seal in
the ham. Roll dough out again into an 11-inch square. Arrange
remaining ham over dough in a diamond pattern as above. Fold
corners into the center and seal once more. Let dough rest for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Roll dough back into an 11-inch square, then roll dough up like
a jelly roll. Tuck ends under and place in a well-oiled 8 1/2-by-4
1/2-inch loaf pan. Cover loosely with a towel. Let stand in a warm
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Position rack in lower third of
oven, place loaf pan in center and bake 50-60 minutes, until bread
sounds hollow when tapped on top. Turn out of pan and cool
completely before serving (if you can wait that long).

 &HT;    Coconut's tropical flavor takes the cake
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get past the purists' preferred plain white cake buried under
fluffy boiled sugar/egg white icing covered with flakes, and the
possibilities for coconut cake multiply exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut's tropical chewiness pairs especially well with other
products of warmer climes _ pineapple, lemon, orange and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   If the cake is sturdy enough, frostings can be mixed or matched
with cream cheese, sour cream or whipped cream topping white,
yellow or citrusy layers.

<P>
   Kate's Coconut Cake
</P>
<P>
   Makes one 9-inch, two-layer cake for 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Kate Almand's cake from Nathalie Dupree's popular 1986 ``New
Southern Cooking'' is the pair's favorite. In the revision they
developed this month, the biggest change is a longer cooking time
for the candylike, translucent off-white icing that looks like an
organdy-and-lace Easter dress and has the consistency of thick
grits. Even so, it is a quick scratch cake because you put hot
icing on still-warm layers.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups cake flour or soft wheat all-purpose flour, such as
White Lily
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh coconut liquid (or light unsweetened coconut milk)
or all-purpose milk (see note)
</P>
<P>
   For the icing:
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites, beaten only until they begin to hold soft peaks
</P>
<P>
   2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Meat of one fresh coconut, ground or grated; or 18 ounces frozen
fresh (not sweetened) coconut
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh coconut liquid
</P>
<P>
   (see note)
</P>
<P>
   To make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Rub or spray two
9-inch cake pans with oil or shortening and lightly dust with
flour. Cut circles of wax paper and fit into the bottom of each
pan; oil and flour the paper lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together. In a separate
bowl, beat the sugar and butter until light, then beat in the eggs
and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients and liquid alternately,
starting and ending with dry ingredients, and beat until smooth.
Pour the batter into the pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes until cake
is pale brown and springs back when lightly touched or when a
toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Turn out onto a
rack and remove wax paper. Using another rack, flip layers so cake
layers are right side up. Carefully place one layer on a plate.
(The cake is too moist to place on cardboard.)
</P>
<P>
   To make the icing: Place the beaten egg whites in a large
saucepan and add sugar, coconut and coconut liquid. Over medium
heat, bring the mixture to a boil; continue to boil and stir with a
wooden spoon 10 minutes. Remove from heat and spread with wooden
spoon on the still-warm bottom layer. Add second layer. Using a
metal spatula, pat icing on sides, then top. If parts of it slide,
just scoop up and pat it back on until set.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Almand uses Hokan brand ``lite coconut milk,'' which comes
in a 13.5-ounce can. She adds enough water to make 2 cups of
liquid, 1 for the cake and 1 for the icing.

   James McNair relies on fresh coconut meat and coconut milk for
this white cake with a smooth filling and whipped cream frosting.
Often he makes two batches of white cake, baking each in a
13-by-9-inch pan, then slicing each in half horizontally to end

with double recipes of filling and frosting.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe for a two-layer
</P>
<P>
   9-inch white cake (see recipe for Classic Fresh Coconut Cake)
</P>
<P>
   For the haupia filling:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   3 cups fresh coconut milk or thawed high-quality commercial
coconut milk (sometimes labeled ``Hawaiian style'' in Asian
markets)
</P>
<P>
   For the whipped cream frosting:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy (whipping) cream, preferably not ultrapasteurized,
well-chilled
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   To finish:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups grated or shredded fresh coconut or frozen fresh coconut
</P>
<P>
   Pesticide-free, nontoxic small orchids for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Prepare cake. Remove the pans to a wire rack to cool for 15 to
20 minutes, then turn the layers out onto the rack to cool
completely. Refrigerate for 30 minutes while making filling.
</P>
<P>
   When cake is chilled, use a sharp knife to carefully trim off
all browned crust from the top, bottom and sides of the layers to
create completely white layers. Slice each layer horizontally in
half to create 4 layers total.
</P>
<P>
   To make the haupia filling: In a heavy saucepan, combine the
sugar and cornstarch. Gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups water until the
mixture is smooth, then stir in the coconut milk. Place over medium
heat and cook, stirring almost constantly, until thickened, about
10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool for about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Spread about 1/4 of the filling between each layer and on top of
the cake. Set aside at room temperature for the filling to set
while preparing the frosting.
</P>
<P>
   To make the whipped cream frosting: Place a metal bowl and wire
whisk or the beaters of a hand mixer in a freezer until well
chilled.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, combine the confectioners' sugar and
cornstarch and whisk to mix well. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup of the
cream until very smooth. Place over medium heat and stir constantly
to prevent scorching on the bottom until the mixture just begins to
thicken and comes almost to a boil. Transfer to a bowl and set
aside, stirring occasionally, to cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   In the chilled bowl, combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream and
the vanilla and beat with the chilled whisk or hand mixer just
until the cream begins to hold its shape. While still beating, add
the confectioners' sugar mixture a little at a time and beat just
until the mixture forms stiff peaks when the beater is raised and
is spreadable; be careful not to overbeat.

   To finish: Frost the cake, starting with the sides and ending
with a 1-inch border around the outside perimeter of the top,
leaving the haupia on the top exposed.

garnish with orchids, if desired. _Adapted from ``James McNair's

   Here's a version of the classic that starts with a cake mix. But
don't think that means you'll be able to dig in sooner. A sour
cream/coconut mixture is spread between the layers and left to soak
two to three days before the cake is iced and served. Paula H.
Deen, owner and proprietor of the Lady &AMP; Sons Restaurant in
Savannah, includes this in her cookbook of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 package (18 1/4-ounce) yellow pudding cake mix, made with milk
instead of water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces canned or frozen shredded coconut
</P>
<P>
   For the icing:
</P>
<P>
   Seven-Minute Icing, made with 1 teaspoon vanilla (see next page)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded coconut
</P>
<P>
   To make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour
three 9-inch round cake pans.
</P>
<P>
   Make cake by following directions on package, substituting milk
for water. Divide batter evenly among pans and bake 20 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from
pans.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together sour cream, sugar and coconut. Spread between
slightly warm cake layers, piercing each layer as you stack them.
Place in container in refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. On the third
day, prepare Seven-Minute Icing. Frost top and sides of cake;
sprinkle with 1/2 cup coconut. Cover and store at room temperature.

   Phyllis Richman, who retires next month as a food writer for The
Washington Post, also wrote ``The Butter Did It: A Gastronomic Tale
of Love and Murder,'' the first in the Chas Wheatley series, and
its follow-up, ``Murder on the Gravy Train.'' She's working on the
third installment, ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham?'' This is her
entry in ``A Taste of Murder,'' a compilation of ``diabolically
delicious recipes from contemporary mystery writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman uses canned coconut, which she likes because it's
moister than packaged, and Southern-style _ grated and not flaked _
making a crunchier topping in her mother's recipe. She recommends
making it only when you have a crowd to feed or you might wind up
eating it all.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, plus extra for the pan
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sifted flour, plus extra for the pan
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   For the topping:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   4- ounce can shredded Southern-style (not flaked) coconut
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   To make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small
saucepan, heat 1 cup milk with 2 tablespoons butter to scalding.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, start beating eggs in an electric mixer. Add sugar
and beat well until thick and foamy. With the beater going slowly,
gradually add hot milk.
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour with the baking powder and salt. Beat into the
egg mixture with the mixer on low speed. Pour into a greased and
floured 13-by-9-inch pan. Bake about 30 minutes, testing with a
toothpick after 25 minutes. Let cool slightly in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   To make the topping: Melt 6 tablespoons butter and add 10
tablespoons brown sugar. Stir in coconut and vanilla. Spread
topping over cake as evenly as possible. Put under the broiler
about 4 to 6 inches from the heat, and broil until topping is
bubbling and brown. Turn the cake if necessary to brown evenly and
broil until topping is as brown as you can get it without burning
it. Watch very carefully, as it goes from done to burned in an
instant.

   Classic Fresh Coconut Cake
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 1 hour (allow another hour for preparing the
fresh coconut)
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 1/4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists will love this meltingly tender, pure-white cake
from master baker Susan Purdy that incorporates fresh coconut and
makes an ideal base for old-fashioned Seven-Minute Icing. It takes
time, but the directions are clear enough for even a novice to
follow, and you will be justly rewarded in taste. Incidentally,
Purdy suggested doubling the icing; we did not _ and found that the
single recipe made plenty to cover our cake.
</P>
<P>
   1 Fresh coconut to yield 1 cup fresh coconut liquid and 2 cups
firmly packed grated fresh coconut meat (1 cup for cake batter and
1 cup for icing)
</P>
<P>
   Milk or cream (if coconut does not yield a full cup of liquid)
</P>
<P>
   Shortening and flour to coat pans
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (10 1/2 ounces) sifted cake flour or White Lily
all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Seven-Minute Icing (recipe below)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon coconut extract (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Remove coconut from its shell and grate according to
instructions, reserving the strained liquid. If you do not have a
full cup of liquid, make up the difference with milk or cream. Save
1 cup well-packed grated meat for the cake, another cup for the
icing.
</P>
<P>
   Spread shortening on bottom and sides of two 9-inch, 1
1/2-inch-deep layer pans. Dust evenly with flour; tap out excess
flour. Position rack in lower third of the oven. Preheat oven to
350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   On a sheet of wax paper, sift together the flour, baking powder
and salt. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In medium-size bowl of electric mixer, whip the egg whites until
stiff but not dry. Remove bowl from the mixer and scrape the
beaters into the bowl. Without washing the beaters, return them to
the mixer.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl of electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar
until completely blended into a smooth, granular paste. Add a
little of the flour mixture and a little of the coconut liquid and
beat on slow speed just to blend (this may be done by hand).
Continue alternately adding a little of the flour mixture and
liquid, blending after each addition and ending with the flour.
Stir in the vanilla and about 1 cup of the whipped egg whites, just
to lighten the batter.
</P>
<P>
   With a rubber spatula, fold the remaining whipped egg whites
over onto themselves once or twice to be sure they are amalgamated.
With a light touch, fold the egg whites into the batter in several
additions. Spread 1 cup grated coconut meat onto a piece of wax
paper and break up any clumps. Gradually sprinkle this coconut onto
the batter and fold it in. Turn batter into the prepared pans and
bake in the preheated oven for about 35 minutes, or until the cake
tops look golden brown and start to pull away from the edges and a
cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the
layers to cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes, then run a
knife around the edge of each layer to release it from the pan. Top
each layer with a wire rack and invert; lift off the pan. Allow
layers to cool completely on the rack.
</P>
<P>
   When cool, cut each layer in half horizontally, using a
long-bladed serrated knife.
</P>
<P>
   While the cake is cooling, prepare the Seven-Minute Icing.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor icing with 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract, if desired. Fold
in 1/2 cup of the reserved cup of coconut meat.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble, put a dab of icing in the center of a cardboard
cake disc or serving platter to hold the cake, then top with 1 cake
layer, cut surface facing up. Spread icing on this layer, then top
with another cake layer and repeat. After adding the top layer,
with all 4 layers lined up, ice the sides, then the top. Sprinkle
remaining 1/2 cup reserved coconut on top.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If frosting the cake on a serving platter, protect the
platter by covering it with strips of wax paper; remove the paper
after icing the cake. _ Adapted from ``A Piece of Cake'' by Susan
Purdy (Collier, 1989)

   If you're crazy about the taste of coconut but could do without
all the goopy, sweet frosting, this easy recipe is for you. While
some coconut poundcakes rely only on coconut extract, those flecked
with coconut bits like this one from Maida Heatter are much closer
to their tropical names.

   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for buttering pan
</P>
<P>

<P>
   7 ounces (2 2/3 loosely packed cups) shredded coconut
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces (1 cup) thinly sliced almonds (preferably unblanched)
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a 10-inch tube pan (with no design), nonstick or regular
(if the pan is not nonstick, butter the bottom and sides). Nonstick
or not, line it with a round of baking-pan liner paper or wax paper
cut to fit, butter the paper and dust the pan all over with fine,
dry bread crumbs; tap to shake out excess crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and preheat oven
to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the 2 sticks of butter
until soft and smooth. Add vanilla and almond extracts, salt and
sugar, and beat to mix. Add eggs one at a time, beating until
incorporated after each addition. On low speed, alternately add the
flour in three 1-cup additions with the milk in two 1/2-cup
additions, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only
until incorporated. Remove from the mixer and fold in the coconut
and the almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Turn into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 1 1/2
hours, until the top is golden brown and a cake tester, inserted to
the bottom, comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   Let stand on a rack for 15 minutes. Cover with a rack, invert
and remove the pan (do not remove the paper yet). Cover with
another rack and invert again, leaving the cake right side up. Let
stand until cool, then carefully remove paper lining.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap the cake in plastic wrap. If possible, refrigerate
overnight. Or place it in the freezer for 45 minutes. It must be
cold when it is sliced or it will crumble. Serve two or three thin
slices to a portion. _ From: ``Maida Heatter's Cakes'' (Cader

   Standing over the body of Bad Boy Records, the referee that is

rapper Black Rob's impressive debut. Now comes Carl Thomas, an
undisputed heavyweight in the small ring of real soul men.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' engagingly simple first single about loving a married
woman, ``I Wish,'' and ``Summer Rain'' _ and, really, most of this
record _ feel old. As if from a time when black music was broadly
arranged, as on ``Hey Now.'' And instead of artists' using lyrics
as a launching pad for their technical abilities, they were used to
tell stories, as this supple vocalist does with ``Givin' You All My
Love.''

   ``Ecstasy''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Reed. Reprise. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   For Lou Reed, the glass is rarely half full or half empty. More
often it's shattered, the shards sparkling like diamonds in dim
light. That dark perspective illuminates the world Reed has
inhabited since his Velvet Underground days. Rock's street-poet
laureate, Reed crafts songs of hustlers and hoods that have the
repellent draw of a roadside wreck: you hate to look; you have to
look. ``Ecstasy'' offers another of Reed's through-a-subway-window
glimpses of the dark side. And the view, while not pretty, is a
thing of strange beauty that ranks with his best. Some of what's
here hinges on self-parody, with Reed's half-spoken vocals dull and
affected. But rockers like ``Modern Dance,'' the riveting ``Like a
Possum'' and pornographic ``Rock Minuet'' are worthy successors to
his ``Walk on the Wild Side.''

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Germans have long had a flair for the dramatic. From Wagner to
the metal maniacs in Rammstein, it seems part of their nature. Ute
Lemper carries on the proud tradition. Though best known as a
cabaret performer, Lemper has won an Olivier (the Brit equivalent
of the Tony) for her performance in Kander and Ebb's ``Chicago.''
She takes on modern pop songs here, but her theatrical roots show
in every line she sings. The word sing, though, is inadequate to
describe what Lemper does to these songs, written by such
formidable songwriters as Scott Walker, Elvis Costello and the
Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon. She gets inside them, taking
possession of them with her versatile voice _ alternately gruff,
sweet or sexy, but always captivating. She's right at home with
Brecht/Weill's ``Tango Ballad,'' and a Brechtian heaviness
permeates the album. You get an inkling of that before you even
hear the album, with song titles such as Costello's ``Couldn't You
Keep That to Yourself'' and Tom Waits' ``The Part You Throw Away.''
It's dark, but what gorgeous gloom.

 &HT;    Retro '60s sounds from a soul sister today
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember soul music? That hip-grinding, gut-wailing sound that
was the sweaty, Brut-drenched essence of Al Green and Marvin Gaye?
Just when it seems like rap has pretty much made the genre passe,
here comes a 31-year-old former country singer from Alabama to show
us what we've been missing.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Lynne has recorded what is possibly one of the smartest
and most provocative albums to arrive in stores since Aretha
Franklin wore a size 12. She's done it by dusting off late 1960s
production techniques that became the signature sound of legendary
labels such as Stax, Volt and Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It's Aretha's ``Do Right Woman'' meets Dusty Springfield's
``Dusty in Memphis,'' the album most often cited as Lynne's
inspiration. And it works. This is not just clever mimicry. The
tunes, all penned by Lynne, are contemporary pop/soul masterpieces.
Lynne's voice is equally as crafted, infused with a Southern
earthiness. After nearly a decade of spinning her wheels in
Nashville, Lynne has emerged a major talent as a soul sister.

 &HT;    Coconut tips
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh green coconut
</P>
<P>
   A truly fresh coconut is a green coconut, sometimes sold at
farmers' markets. Scoop the jellylike insides out with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ripe coconut
</P>
<P>
   The ripe, brown, barklike coconuts common in produce sections at
most grocery stores are dried, though they are often referred to as
``fresh'' to distinguish them from the further-dried flaked or
shredded products sold in packages and cans.
</P>
<P>
   When a recipe calls for fresh coconut, it more than likely means
draining and cracking a brown coconut. These tips, unless otherwise
noted, are from Kate Almand, who works with Nathalie Dupree.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buying: Look for coconuts with no dusty or moldy appearance in
the ``eyes.'' Shake to make sure they are full of liquid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To drain: Use a hammer and clean nail or screwdriver to poke
holes in two of the ``eyes'' all the way through to the liquid
center. Drain liquid into a bowl, then strain through cheesecloth.
If you notice a musty odor when the coconut is drained, discard it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To grate: Heating a drained coconut helps loosen the flesh
from the covering. If after heating 10 minutes in a 375-degree oven
the coconut is not cracked, TV chef Sara Moulton suggests wrapping
it in a kitchen towel and whacking it on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A microwave method comes from Barbara Kafka in ``The Microwave
Gourmet'': Put drained coconut in a microwave-safe bag, seal
completely and heat on high for about 6 1/2 minutes. Remove from
the bag, add any liquid that has collected to the liquid reserved.
The husk should be cracked and the flesh can be lifted out.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the brown papery coating can be pared away with a
vegetable peeler or small sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   Put chunks in the food processor to grate. You should have about
2 to 2 1/2 cups of grated coconut.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coconut milk: Milk is made by boiling coconut liquid with some
of the grated meat, which includes the fat. If you don't want to go
to the trouble of draining, cracking and grating a brown coconut,
the next best thing is buying chunks of white flesh, sold at some
farmers' markets. Even though you didn't start with a whole nut,
you can still make coconut milk if needed in a recipe using a
method from Elizabeth Schneider in ``Uncommon Fruits &AMP;
Vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Boil equal amounts of water and grated coconut. Put in a food
processor and process 30 seconds. Let mixture stand 20 minutes.
Strain, mashing the pulp to make sure you get all the juice.
</P>
<P>
   If you want thinner milk, let stand a few minutes and skim off
cream; or pour boiling water over the coconut meat a second time to
extract a bit more flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If the recipe calls for fresh coconut milk and you haven't
drained one yourself or made it from coconut meat, a good
substitute is Hokan brand ``lite coconut milk.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  `Fresh' frozen: If you don't want to grate your own coconut,
the next best thing is frozen coconut labeled as ``fresh frozen''
and sold in many grocery stores in the South. It is usually
unsweetened or very lightly sweetened.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Flaked, shredded, sweetened, packaged, canned: Other recipes
have been created especially for the more widely available flaked
or grated, sweetened or un-, in packages and cans. Canned coconut
is moister than packaged.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Toasted: To toast coconut, spread on a baking sheet and bake
in a 350-degree oven about 20 minutes, stirring often, until
golden. Or microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tinting: Put 1 cup shredded coconut and 3 drops food coloring
in a jar. Close tightly and shake until evenly tinted.

 &HT;    Easter bread is a sweet colorful treat
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dannie Bell's grandchildren will be the lucky ones now that
their grandmother's hunt for an Easter treat turned up a recipe she
sought. Bell asked for a version of the often-seen brunch sweet
bread with tinted eggs on top.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes we uncovered varied in ingredients _ with some including
candied fruit and spices _ and in whether to tint and/or hard-boil
the eggs before setting them into the dough and baking.
</P>
<P>
   This one uses uncooked eggs, which bake with the bread. Our
tester notes that if you tint them before baking, some of the food
coloring may bleed into the dough. You may want to paint coloring
on after the ring has baked and cooled.

<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   1 package (1 tablespoon) active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   9 eggs, divided
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups (about) all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoon crushed aniseed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped candied fruit
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped almonds
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   In small saucepan, heat milk, 1/4 cup sugar, butter and salt
until butter has melted. Cool to lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Dissolve 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water; sprinkle in the yeast
and let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
</P>
<P>
   In large mixing bowl, combine yeast mixture, milk mixture and 2
lightly beaten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Put flour in a bowl. Stir in orange rind and aniseed. Using
electric mixer, gradually beat 1 1/2 cups of the flour mixture into
the yeast mixture; beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. With wooden
spoon, gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour mixture to
make soft, slightly sticky dough.
</P>
<P>
   Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until
smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl,
turning to grease all over. Cover with plastic wrap (or greased
waxed paper and tea towel); let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until
doubled in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Punch down dough; knead in raisins, candied fruit and almonds.
Divide dough in half. Roll each piece into 26-inch long rope and
twist together. Transfer to greased baking sheet. Bring ends
together to form into ring, pinching ends to seal. Gently pull
twisted ropes apart and tuck 6 whole uncooked eggs (tinted if
desired) into openings, placing eggs evenly around ring. (Eggs will
become hard-cooked during baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Cover and let rise about 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Separate remaining egg. Mix yolk
with milk and brush glaze over ring. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or
until crust is golden brown and bottom of ring sounds hollow when
tapped. Remove from pan and let cool on rack. _ From: Canadian

 &HT;    Gender switch remarkable for Swank
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This intense, disorienting, rawly unsettling film is based on
the true story of Teena Brandon, a 21-year-old woman who fiercely
believed she was a man. She cut her hair short, reversed her name
and started hanging out with some hard-drinking rednecks in rural
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't work out. The movie is a bit unrelenting, a bit too
low-budget rough-around-the-edges. But it's still a remarkable
achievement and Oscar-winner Hilary Swank gives a stunning
performance.
</P>
<P>
   `Boys Don't Cry'
</P>

   OTHER VIDEO RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Stuart Little (PG) _ Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945
children's book, Stuart is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder
voiced by Michael J. Fox. He brushes his teeth, gargles and
aw-shucks smiles with such convincing visuals you'll swear he's the
next best critter since ``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming
and angelic, turns into run-of-the-mill slapstick. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``End of Days'' (R) _ Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest
he-man Arnold Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano
with a beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this
explosion-happy thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography
and bloated with bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie
full of punches but no spark. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Music of the Heart'' (PG) _ The Meryl Streep Show _ and what
a show it is. Streep and her unlikely collaborator, director Wes
Craven (``Scream''), have delivered a rarity: an inspirational
movie that actually is, well, inspirational. Based on a true story,
the film follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant
kids, confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in
her battle to teach violin (and more, of course) to inner-city
kids. Yeah, at heart it's a glorified TV-movie, but it's got Streep
and that's all it needs.Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Red Violin'' (unrated) _ Francois Girard's
centuries-spanning saga is as florid and emotional as his
``Thirty-Two Short Works about Glenn Gould'' was spare and
sophisticated. The film follows the fortunes _ and, more often,
misfortunes _ of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. Too melodramatic in spots, too schematic in others,
this is still a film for anyone who's ever felt a chill as a tarot
card is turned over. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mumford'' (R) _ Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan delivers a
sunny, low-key crowd-pleaser about a therapist named Mumford (Loren
Dean) whose effect on his clients changes the mood of their whole
town (also called Mumford). With a crack supporting cast, it's a
gentle vacation from the high-concept bangs and lowbrow laughs so
often found in the multiplex. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``House on Haunted Hill'' (R) _ A redo of the 1958 Vincent
Price spookfest, it's a loud assault on the senses and a (literal)
bloody mess. But as a meat-and-potatoes (or guts-and-eyeballs)
scare machine, it has its moments. Geoffrey Rush invites five
strangers to spend the night in a haunted house to win $1 million
each. Then the gore begins. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Bachelor'' (PG-13) _ Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San
Francisco playboy who loses his girl, Anne (Renee Zellweger), then
finds he'll inherit $100 million if he marries within 24 hours. A
clumsy remake of Buster Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,''
it retains the original's surreal image of thousands of potential
brides chasing the groom-to-be. Grade: D

 &HT;    Slam-dunk movies to stay ahead of game
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With March Madness over, what's a round ball fan to do? Well,
you could check out ``Love and Basketball,'' a new movie starring
Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan that opens Friday in metro Atlanta. Or
you could hold your own video Final Four at home. Here are a few
ideas, some more hoop-centric than others:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hoop Dreams.'' This extraordinary documentary may be the
finest film ever made about basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert have
delivered a movie that's about far more than backboards and
rebounds. They've served up a richly observed, superbly nuanced
slice of the American dream as they follow the hopes, hard work and
heartbreak that dog two inner-city phenoms as they struggle to make
it to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Agee and William Gates are 14 when we meet them. Both
have grown up on the rubble-strewn, drug-littered courts of
inner-city Chicago. Both have exceptional ability that gets them
recruited by a tony suburban high school. From there, it's a matter
of luck, timing and true-life unpredictability. This marvelous film
scores a slam-dunk by showing us the rules of the game on and off
the court.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hoosiers'': The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this
movie about the little Indiana team that could, but the impact is
undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1951, and Gene Hackman is the new coach in a hick
burg, looking for a second chance for himself and a state
championship for his underdog team. The film captures a time when
high school sports was about playing the game, not college
recruiting, drug tests and no pass-no play.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hopper managed a best supporting actor nomination for his
role as a former high school star offered a position as Hackman's
assistant coach if he can stay off booze. He later joked that he
and Hackman couldn't understand why the filmmakers kept shooting
``all those damned basketball games. We were sitting on these
wooden benches saying, `Here's the big money. Why aren't you
shooting us?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``He Got Game'': Spike Lee shows us the money and the groupies
and the cars and the rent-free digs and the
anything-your-heart-desires temptations routinely dangled in front
of hot, young high school prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures on these young Nike endorsers in the making
are only part of the story. There's also an acutely observed
father-son relationship in which a jailbird father (a wonderful
Denzel Washington) is made an unusual offer by his warden (Ned
Beatty): If he can convince his son, a budding star from the
projects (Ray Allen, whose real job is playing for the Milwaukee
Bucks), to sign with the governor's alma mater, he'll get a reduced
sentence. One not so small problem: Father and son have been
bitterly estranged for years.
</P>
<P>
   Look for some cameos by real-life players and coaches, including
Georgia Tech's gone-but-never-forgotten Bobby Cremins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Forget Paris'': Most of you have probably forgotten there
ever was a movie named ``Forget Paris,'' and if you do remember it,
you've almost certainly forgotten that it had anything at all to do
with basketball.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was really more of a romance about what happened
after Billy (Crystal) met Debra (Winger). But Crystal, who also
directed, let his passion for basketball seep through by making his
character an NBA referee. It not only gave him a chance to hang out
with some of his idols but taught him something about being a ref.

 &HT;    Give your decor a kick-start by updating your lamps with a a new
look that starts at the top
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like the right lampshade to shed new light on
everything.
</P>
<P>
   A shade is like a fashion accessory. It can dress up a naked
light bulb as well as update Aunt Edith's prized porcelain lamp,
your favorite ginger jar or a classic candlestick base. Often, it's
more cost effective to simply buy a shade than invest in a new
lamp. To help you find the bright spots in shades, we scoped out
decorating experts to learn the light stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of things
</P>
<P>
   Replacement shades, said Carolyn Uhl, owner of Sunlighting Lamp
&AMP; Shade Center on Roswell Road, come in seven basic shapes: bell;
coolie (like the hat); empire (straight-sided, with bottom 16
inches, the top 8 inches); hexagonal, oval, rectangular and square.
They are made from plastic, parchment or papers (hardback shades)
or from fabrics, including silks, linens and polyesters (soft
shades).
</P>
<P>
   Price-y points
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive shades _ some start as low as $7 _ are
machine-made and usually imported. The more expensive ones,
starting around $50, are partly hand-sewn, partly machine-made,
usually in the United States. Box pleating and any kind of trim _
including tassels, fringe and braiding _ also up the ante. ``The
more `fun' a lampshade is, the more expensive it becomes,'' says
Uhl, who custom makes and designs shades as well as carrying
ready-made versions in her shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people haven't bought a shade for several years, they are
shocked about the prices,'' says Roger Cohen, the owner of Aaron's
Lamp &AMP; Shade Center on Northside Parkway. ``A shade dries out from
heat, if the light is used constantly. And it should be replaced
every five to six years. However, if you use a lamp moderately with
low bulb wattage, a good shade will last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Revamp a lamp
</P>
<P>
   Different-size shades can work on the same base, says Carl
Smith, manager of Sharon's Lighting in Chamblee Plaza, which keeps
about 4,000 lampshades in stock. To adjust, simply try a larger or
smaller harp, which is a pair of vertical metal supports on which
the shade rests. A harp comes in half-inch increments between 5 1/2
inches and 14 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finishing touch for any lamp is the finial, the decorative
screw on top of the shade,'' says Smith. ``Once that is in place,
and all the proportions are correct, your whole lamp should sit up
and sing.''
</P>
<P>
   A tip from Ladies' Home Journal on figuring the dimensions of
the right shade for your lamp: The height of the shade should equal
the height of lamp base divided by 3. The widest diameter of shade
should equal the widest diameter of the base times 2.
</P>
<P>
   See watts new
</P>
<P>
   To take the guesswork out of shade buying, Target stores just
introduced its Mix &AMP; Match Lighting. More than 70 types of shades
in patterned parchment and textured papers will mix or mate with 70
different bases, including pewter, brushed silver, wood and wrought
iron. You can create a lamp to give a room its own personality.
Shade prices: $6.99-$29.99.
</P>
<P>
   Color notes
</P>
<P>
   The perennials _ white, off white, cream, ecru, taupe, gold _
are the most popular. Gaining ground are black, red and green.
Remember: Neutral shades allow more light through the shade.
``And,'' says Smith of Sharon's Lighting, ``shades in a room don't
have to match in color. They should blend in with other fabrics and
upholstery in the room.''

   Q: I moved from Pennsylvania to Georgia and have been unable to
find Cope's canned corn locally. I want to make their recipe Baked
Corn, which is absolutely delicious. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Avis L. Rhodes, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can get ``corny'' with this sweet perennial veggie. For a
hundred years, the Cope family has been growing sweet corn in
Pennsylvania Dutch country. Unfortunately, the company does not
sell its products locally. These include white or golden evaporated
sweet corn in cans (ready to heat and serve) or toasted dried sweet
corn, which either must be ground in a blender or soaked in a
liquid before cooking. However, you can order Cope products on
their Web site at www.copefoods.com. Or order them by calling
1-800-745-8211. Three 7.5-ounce cartons of dried sweet corn are
$11.65; six cans of the evaporated golden sweet corn are $12.90.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Jaffa Cakes, made by McVitie's, an English
company. My sister sends them to me from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terry Wills,
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: No need to have sis send those sweets anymore. We found your
Jaffa Cakes _ made in Britain _ at Harry's Farmers Market, 2025
Satellite Pointe, Duluth (770-416-6900). A box of 12 cakes is
$2.19. To our eyes, these light little sponge goodies, with a hint
of orange, look more like cookies iced in chocolate than cakes.
They would be delicious served with ice cream or eaten with a cuppa
Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am having trouble finding Old English Scratch Cover for
light woods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mima Carmichael,
</P>
<P>
   Acworth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We scratched our heads and came up with your product at
Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, 4855 Stone Mountain Highway,
Lilburn (770-978-9724). An 8-ounce bottle is $3.67. Scratch Cover,
says manufacturer Reckitt &AMP; Benckiser, hides scratches and nicks
and helps restore damaged wood surfaces. This product is formulated
to work on light to medium woods such as pine and oak. You can also
order this product directly from the company (an 8-ounce bottle is
$4.39): 1-800-456-9477.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For months, I have not been able to find Dermassage
Dishwashing Liquid. I fear they have quit making it. If not, I
would love to know where I could purchase it. My hands would really
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hope
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells,
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fear not. Your favorite dishwashing liquid is available at
Ingles Supermarket, 4815 Rockbridge Road, Stone Mountain
(404-299-0698). A 22-ounce bottle is 99 cents. This liquid, says
manufacturer Colgate-Palmolive, is phosphate free, and
dermatologist tested. And your hands are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once complimented a woman on her perfume, which smelled
heavenly. She said it received mention in the movie ``Scent of a
Woman.'' I think in the film, the character played by Al Pacino
said the perfume was Fleurs de Rocaille. Five years later, I still
haven't been able to find this perfume. I've searched everywhere,
including the Internet. Can you please help me?
</P>
<P>
   _ Rebekah A. Hall, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We nosed around a bit and came up with your fragrance; in
fact, two versions. Fleurs de Rocaille (translated flowers of the
rock) by Caron came out in 1933. It's a blend of rose, jasmine,
carnation and oakmoss. This indeed is the one mentioned in the
movie ``Scent of a Woman.'' In 1983, Caron introduced Fleur de
Rocaille, without the ``s'' on Fleur, in tribute to the fragrance's
50th anniversay. This one is lighter, a fruity floral containing
gardenia notes, jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and wood notes.
Saks Fifth Avenue in Phipps Plaza (404-261-7234) carries both
versions. A 1.7-ounce eau de toilette of each version is $60. You
can also order this fragrance through the Caron Boutique, 675
Madison Ave., New York, NY 10021, 212-319-4888.

   Pity for the Plagiarist
</P>
<P>
   Q. A college student called last week to say his ``friend'' had
visited my Web page, lifted something I wrote and turned it in as
her own work. Suspicious, her professor plans to search the Web; if
he finds the paper was plagiarized, he'll recommend expulsion. The
student implored me to take that paper off my site, lest his
``friend's'' academic career, and possibly her life, be ruined.
What do I do?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A. Properly assigning credit is delicate business. If I sign
Rembrandt's name to my work, it's forgery; if I sign my name to
Rembrandt's work, it's plagiarism. There's just no pleasing some
people. But what's astonishing here is not the expropriation; it's
the request that you cover it up. Presumably, if this woman had
stolen your stereo, she'd ask you for a lift to her fence.
</P>
<P>
   When the penalty is severe enough, however, a wrongdoer's
appeals for mercy are not entirely ludicrous. It would be hard not
to relent if, say, the Taliban threatened to topple a wall onto
her. (Though if she survived, I believe she'd automatically ace the
semester.)
</P>
<P>
   Expulsion from college is not such a case. Even if she receives
the worst possible punishment _ by no means a certainty _ it's
unlikely to wreck her life. A young woman with this low level of
moral inhibition and high level of chutzpah should flourish in
modern America. She might be lucky enough to one day find herself
in a nice federal minimum security prison, where she can make
professional connections that will set her up forever. Or perhaps
she'll get a job at Cliff's Notes, giving a new generation of kids
a legitimate means of cribbing their way through college.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your heart goes out to the young plagiarist, you're not
at liberty to drop the charges, since you're not the victim of this
crime. You can, however, call the professor and appeal for
leniency. But destroying the evidence is definitely the wrong way
to go.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe me, check out a 1976 movie called ``All the
President's Men.'' I won't spoil it for you by giving away the
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My fun-loving friend Frank is celebrating his birthday next
week, and he wants the festivities to include a tour of New
Jersey's topless (and bottomless) bars. It sounds like a lot of fun
(more for anthropological than prurient reasons _ no, seriously),
and I'm determined to go, but what do I tell my girlfriend? How do
I convince her that I'm doing it for a friend?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A. Convince her? You haven't convinced me. In any case, does
doing it for a friend alter the essential act? Isn't the phrase
``bottomless bar in New Jersey'' already so far beyond the pale
that there's little more to say? And might there not be a more
evocative way to describe Frank than ``fun-loving?''
</P>
<P>
   Were your objections merely aesthetic, you should of course
accommodate your jaunty pal. But if instead you or your girlfriend
are discomforted by the moral implications of the festivities, then
taking along some buddies is a feeble justification. Nor am I
persuaded that there's a meaningful distinction between
``anthropological'' and ``condescending.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's no point in convincing your girlfriend that you're
going for Frank's sake. If you're comfortable with the plan, your
task is to convince her that it's OK to go at all, at least once.
Perhaps this will help. Invited by the Marquis de Sade to a second
orgy, Voltaire declined, although he'd quite enjoyed the first.
``Once is philosophy,'' he said. ``Twice is perversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently received a job offer, which I orally accepted.
When I approached my current employer with my resignation, he made
a counteroffer. I now wish to remain with my current employer. Is
it correct to revoke my acceptance of the original offer?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A. The most virtuous thing to do is stand by your word unless
your prospective employer is willing to release you. He probably
will. No one wants a disgruntled worker on staff. But while
garnering offers is fine, accepting them isn't, at least not if
what you prefer is to keep your current job and get a nice raise.
Next time don't be so quick to accept an offer you may not want.
</P>
<P>
   If you do decide to stay where you are, there are a couple of
ways to make it up to your would-be employer. First, promptly
inform him of your plans, to minimize his inconvenience. And
second, be candid; tell him why you've changed your mind. Who
knows, he may match your counteroffer _ to which I hope you've not
blurted out another reckless acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Be grateful that your indiscretion involved an actual
contemporary job offer and not a marriage proposal in a
19th-century novel: you'd be horsewhipped and driven from the
county.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I frequently carry a can of soda or a package of snacks into
the movie theater. Does the theater have the right to insist on
``no outside food''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Margaret O'Hora, Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, as transgressions go, yours is minor, but it is a
transgression. The upright act is to obey the rules; going to the
movies is strictly voluntary, and from the theater's point of view,
when you buy a ticket, you accept its strictures. By smuggling in
food, you break your agreement and hence behave unethically.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters also claim to price their tickets on the assumption
that they'll be making some profit at the concession stand. From
the customer's point of view, however, there is no choice in the
matter: take it or leave it. (And stay home and watch TV.)
Furthermore, even if Milk Duds profits run high, the movie theater
isn't going to lower its prices. So the temptation to save money is
understandable, but it ought to be resisted.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I would add: if you come to the theater with popcorn
stuffed inside your shirt, you should not offer any to your
neighbors.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Are you ticked off at the federal government for
anything? Hate paying all those taxes, for instance? Think NASA is
a big waste of time and money? Maybe you just liked the way Old
Glory looked with 48 stars and want to rescind Alaska's and
Hawaii's statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Have we got the solution for you.
</P>
<P>
   Call the 800 number now scrolling across your screen and find
out where the nearest Elian's Miami Relatives School of Civil
Disobedience is located in your area.
</P>
<P>
   Forget everything you ever learned in U.S. government class in
high school. Forget the old Jimmy Stewart movies. Forget what the
cops and judges tell you.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET THE LAW!
</P>
<P>
   As Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives have proven, this is the
United States of America in 2000, and it's a whole new ballgame.
Let THEM show you how to play to win!
</P>
<P>
   Voiceover and video of Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez,

know I don't take anything from anybody. Especially the U.S.
government.
</P>

   ``You got a beef with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service? Had it up to here with the decisions those jack-booted
municipal, state and federal judges keep handing down? Sick and
tired of hearing Janet Reno talk about anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``Come sign up for a weekend seminar at Elian's Miami Relatives
School of Civil Disobedience. That's right. In just two days of
classes and workshops, you can learn everything we've learned since
Thanksgiving about doing what you damn well please while the mighty
U.S. government stands around with its finger up its nose.''

on an overstuffed sofa.
</P>
<P>
   MG: ``Do I look stressed out? In need of a hospital bed and an
IV drip of sedatives? Maybe I am, and maybe I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Elian's Miami Relatives School of Civil Disobedience
you can learn this effective, time-buying technique and many, many
others. Never again will you have to quake at a deadline, court
order or even a request from the president of the United States. In
the finest American tradition of the Boston Tea Party, we will show
you how to spit in the face of authority and make sure there are
350 television cameras rolling when you do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just one weekend, you can learn how to attract support from
every pocket of influence in your community. Need a high-ranking
Roman Catholic nun to give you her seal of approval? We'll show you
how. Always wanted a movie star or pop singer on your side? Once
you pick up a few basic skills, it's as easy as 1-2-3.

haven't you been mystified and wondered, `How in the hell do his
relatives in Miami get away with this stuff?'

 &HT;    GUN CONTROL FADING AS A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ISSUE
 &HT;    840&AMP;add. With GORE-BUSH-GUNS.
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Thousands of Tennesseans visit the weekend
gun show that Dave Goodman stages at the state fairgrounds here
each month, and the anger that many express over Al Gore's gun
policies is helping put a political safety lock on the issue in
this year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own a gun these days, some people look at you like
you're some kind of wacko,'' said Ron Pecorella, a retired
stockbroker from nearby Murfreesboro, as he shopped the 300 tables
of handguns, rifles, knives and hunting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angry? I'm damn angry,'' added Goodman. ``They're trying to
turn a right into a privilege. They're trying to stigmatize
law-abiding Americans. And they're trying to put us out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Goodman, 39, has been running the gun
show his father, Bill, started in 1968. He holds up to 80 shows a
year, mostly in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.
And everywhere he goes gun owners are ``fed up'' with the
Clinton-Gore administration, Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of anger is having an unexpected effect on the gun
control debate, which was supposed to favor Democrats this fall _
especially Vice President Gore's expected race against Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic primaries, Gore's anti-gun rhetoric was
directed at Bush rather than his challenger, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, who advocated registration of all firearms.
But since securing the nomination, Gore has said little about
Bush's gun positions.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that gun control, once a centerpiece of Gore's
campaign strategy against Bush, may not emerge as a defining issue
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As public opinion polls show Americans increasingly skeptical of
the need for more gun laws, Gore and Democratic congressional
candidates are beginning to speak of gun ``safety'' rather than gun
``control.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's scheduled appearance at a New Jersey school Thursday, the
anniversary of the deadly shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado, was promoted by campaign officials as a ``school safety
forum'' on keeping guns out of schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Gore's reluctance to emphasize the gun
issue against Bush is that the National Rifle Association's (NRA)
strategy of advocating increased enforcement of existing laws
appears to be winning converts beyond the organization's fiercely
loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News/Washington Post poll this month found that 53
percent of Americans preferred ``stricter enforcement of existing
laws,'' while 33 percent preferred ``passing stricter gun control
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Columbine tragedy, 66 percent of Americans agreed that
laws covering the sale of firearms should be made stricter,
according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in April 1999. But that
percentage has now dropped to 61 percent, the poll found this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore can't go too far to the left on this and win the general
election,'' said Daniel Webster, an assistant professor of health
at the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins
University's School of Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates insist, however, that gun violence will be
a major issue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a presidential campaign, a major
candidate is advocating licensing of gun owners,'' said David
Bernstein, spokesman for Handgun Control, the organization Sara
Brady has headed since the assassination attempt that left her
husband, former Reagan White House press secretary Jim Brady,
partially paralyzed. ``We're very pleased about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's criticism of Bush's pro-gun stance has focused primarily
on the governor's signing of a law in 1995 that made it legal for
Texans to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Gore has coordinated efforts with Democratic
members of Congress to highlight a 1997 Texas law that would make
it more difficult to prosecute Texans who carry concealed weapons
into banned areas such as churches and synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can respect the rights of hunters and legitimate gun owners
while also acknowledging that bullets and Bibles don't mix,'' said
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who is frequently mentioned as a
possible running mate for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of the NRA's enforcement argument has provided
Bush with a response to such criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for Governor Bush to try to hide from this
issue, because the fact of the matter is the Clinton-Gore
administration has not enforced the laws that are already on the
books,'' said Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican
National Committee (RNC) and a top adviser to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are also indications that Gore's potential for political
gain on the gun issue is limited.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-class suburbanites who favor sweeping gun control
measures don't necessarily go to the polls for that reason alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun owners are always ready to vote this issue,'' said William
Schneider, a political analyst for CNN and the American Enterprise
Institute, a Washington research group. ``Gun controllers rarely
vote the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   With gun control, as with other issues, Gore's history is one of
twists and turns. While representing Tennessee in Congress, he
voted with the NRA on some key measures.
</P>
<P>
   He voted for cutting the budget of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, and favored a Firearms Owners' Protection Act
that relaxed some restrictions on gun and ammunition sales. He also
voted against putting serial numbers on guns and against a 14-day
waiting period for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, however, he has steadfastly backed the
gun-control policies of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, Gore has promised to build on the
Clinton gun policies, including the creation of a photo ID
licensing system for handgun purchases, a ban on cheap ``junk''
guns, increasing penalties for gun-related crimes and a three-day
background check for gun show purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the vice president voted to break a 50-50 tie when
the Senate passed the three-day waiting period for purchases at gun
shows. The measure stalled in the House, which backed a 24-hour
waiting period. Most gun shows are held on weekends, and a
three-day waiting period would make it hard for most gun dealers to
make sales at shows.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore also has claimed credit for helping to
shepherd some of the administration's major gun control measures
through the Senate, including the 1993 Brady bill, which required
background checks on handgun purchasers, and the 1994 crime bill,
which banned semi-automatic assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be in touch with Tennessee on guns, but he's way
out of step now,'' said Gene Kennedy, a Nashville firearms
instructor and author of ``Legally Armed in Tennessee,'' a book
that explains the process for obtaining a handgun permit in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's politics, not gun control,'' said Goodman. ``Gun
control is enforcement _ sending criminals to prison. But this
isn't about stopping criminals from getting guns. This is about the
vice president playing politics with our rights.''

   Look, Doc, No Pad! Rx for Prescriptions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The poor quality of doctors' handwriting has long been a source
of jokes. But to Glen Tullman, chief executive of Allscripts, a
company in Libertyville, Ill., doctors with poor penmanship are
also a serious health risk. ``A significant number of medical
errors come from physicians' handwriting,'' he said. ``When you
rent a car they use a computer because they don't want to make an
error. Here you're dealing with something that's a life-and-death
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Tullman's company is one of a growing number trying to persuade
doctors to dump handwritten prescriptions in favor of those
produced by a wireless, handheld computer. Allscripts packages its
TouchScript software in Hewlett-Packard Jornada Series 600 handheld
computers, which use the Windows CE software system.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors use touch screen commands to create prescriptions and
then send them electronically to patients' pharmacies. Before
doctors commit to a particular drug, they can also use the computer
to review warnings about possible drug interactions and see if the
product is covered by patients' insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Allscripts has sold about 3,000 units, Tullman said. Doctors pay
about $200 a month for the service, plus a setup charge. Limited
memory means the handheld units are unable to function alone.
Instead, they swap data wirelessly with a conventional desktop
server in the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively slow speeds of wireless Internet connections make
it currently impossible for the units to go to directly to the Web,
Tullman said. That is an issue, he said, that is closely linked to
another common gripe about doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians, in some cases, only spend three minutes with
patients,'' he said. ``So it's got to be lightning fast.''

   Voyeur Cams in Nests Offer Bird's-Eye Views Of Fine Feathers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a voyeur cam that the whole family can watch. Cornell
University's ornithology laboratory is again presenting its Nest
Box Cams, small birdhouses equipped with internal video cameras so
that Web surfers can observe as birds settle down and raise a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Two nest boxes, in the Carolinas, are up and running on the
site, birdsource.cornell.edu/birdhouse/camframe.html, and a third,
in New York, is expected to be active soon.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras, which offer bird's-eye views of the floors of the
nest boxes, refresh every minute, and an annotated archive of
images is available.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina nest box has been particularly active, with a
Carolina chickadee laying six eggs, at least five of which have
hatched. The North Carolina box was off to a slower start.
Chickadees and then bluebirds brought in moss and grass for use in
making a nest. But strong winds blew the material out, and a male
bluebird was spied stealing some. And now, wasps have taken an
interest in the box. Stay tuned. &QL;

   Personal Surfing at Work Is Not So Extensive, Study Finds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Companies that monitor how their employees use the Internet
usually argue that they have no choice: Workers, the companies say,
are surfing the Web on company time, distributing confidential
information willy-nilly, and receiving or sending offensive
messages.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study commissioned by Elron Software, a maker of
monitoring software, tries to prove that point. Of more than 500
employees surveyed by NFO Interactive, a market research company,
27 percent say that they have received e-mail messages that leak
confidential data about other companies. And more than 50 percent
said that they had received offensive e-mail messages on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the results don't sound so bad. According to the
survey, only one-third of respondents said they spend more than 25
minutes per day using the Internet for personal reasons _ hardly
enough time to even post a sale item on eBay. The other two-thirds
spends even less time on the Web for matters outside of work. &QL;

   When Keyboard Disasters Come In on Little Cat Feet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A sleeping cat curled up on a warm, toasty computer monitor can
be quite an adorable sight, but when Fluffy takes a stroll across
your keyboard while the computer is on, bad things can happen.
Desktop shortcuts could be deleted, Internet connections lost, and
if you have left any files open on screen, you may not appreciate
the cat's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   PawSense, by BitBoost Systems, (www.bitboost.com/pawsense) is a
$20 software utility for Windows that offers to keep unintentional
cat computing to a minimum. The software runs in the background
until it detects unusual activity on the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Once ``catlike typing'' has been detected, the PawSense blocks
input from the keys to prevent unwanted commands or deletions to
your computer and files. It can also emit a loud noise to scare the
cat away.
</P>
<P>
   PawSense distinguishes little cat feet from humans with lousy
typing skills by analyzing the key combinations pressed by cat
paws. ``Cats' patterns of overall movement in walking or lying down
also help make their typing more recognizable,'' the site says.
Several cats helped test the software, created by Chris Niswander.
</P>
<P>
   The program will let you record your own sound to shoo Kitty off
the keys, or you can use one of the noises included in the program.
According to PawSense, the harmonica is a sound that cats dislike.
</P>
<P>
   A Mac version is under construction, but until then, concerned
Mac users might want to keep a Little Walter album playing in their
CD-ROM drives all day while the cat is home alone with hardware. &QL;

ARTS ABROAD: A FIRST FILM, BUT DEFINITELY NOT AN AMATEUR IN
CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ All too often, first films are ``written and directed
by'' affairs, with friends cast as extras, a small budget put
together by begging and borrowing and a less-than-even chance of
finding a distributor. But if an aspiring moviemaker has already
won a drawerful of prizes for directing everything except cinema,
well, perhaps things are easier. That, at least, has been Deborah
Warner's experience.
</P>
<P>
   While still in her late 20s, Warner made her name as something
of a wunderkind of the British stage through innovative
interpretations of classics at the Royal Shakespeare Company and
the Royal National Theater. Subsequently she directed opera at
Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. And most recently, she has done
experimental stagings of T.S. Eliot's poem ``The Waste Land,''
Janacek's ``Diary of One Who Vanished'' and Bach's ``St. John's
Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Moviemaking seemed like a logical next step, and when the
invitation came, the unsurprising answer was, Why not? At the age
of 40, she was ready for a new test. And thanks to her reputation,
she could count on being shielded from the usual headaches by
people far more seasoned in the business.
</P>
<P>
   So ``The Last September,'' which opens in New York on April 21
and in other American cities April 28, is not exactly a typical
first film. Working with her, Warner had Neil Jordan, the
Oscar-winning Irish director (``The End of the Affair''), as
executive producer; John Banville, the award-winning Irish novelist
(``The Book of Evidence''), as screenwriter; and Slawomir Idziak, a
respected Polish cinematographer (``Blue''), as director of
photography. Also, budget and distribution were not her problems.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to casting the movie, a screen adaptation of a much
loved novel about Ireland by Elizabeth Bowen, Warner needed no
introductions. Two giants of the English stage, Dame Maggie Smith
and Michael Gambon, came on board, as did Jane Birkin and Lambert
Wilson. And Fiona Shaw's inclusion was a given _ she has played the
lead role in several of Warner's most successful stage productions,
including ``Electra,'' ``Hedda Gabler,'' ``Richard II'' and ``The
Waste Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the start of filming approached, Warner was hardly
nonchalant. In fact, she was worried. ``We had one rehearsal week,
which was quite terrifying for me because I'm used to eight
weeks,'' she said over tea in her north London apartment. ``But I
had one good idea. We hired a country house near our location, and
we spent a week together eating, with Maggie at one end of the
table and Michael at the other, and we gradually became our
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly good idea because ``The Last September''
is set almost entirely in a country house in southern Ireland. The
time is 1920, with the Irish independence struggle gathering pace
and the Anglo-Irish aristocracy installed by Cromwell 250 years
earlier beginning to suspect _ and anxiously deny _ that its days
are numbered. At Danielstown, the bucolic seat of Sir Richard and
Lady Myra Naylor (Gambon and Dame Maggie), the tennis parties go
on, but the British Army is already patrolling the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   This was a world all too familiar to Elizabeth Bowen, who was
born in Dublin in 1899 and spent her early summers in Bowen's
Court, the family seat in County Cork, which served as the model
for Danielstown when she wrote ``The Last September'' in 1929. It
was a world in which the landed class sounded entirely English,
sent its sons to English boarding schools and traveled to London
for medical attention, but nonetheless described itself as Irish.
Irish nationalists naturally saw things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so interesting about this story is watching these
Anglo-Irish characters in great denial,'' Warner said. ``They
didn't want to know there were tigers at the bottom of the garden,
and the tigers were green.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last September'' follows the coming of age of Sir
Richard's 19-year-old niece, Lois (Keeley Hawkes), who herself
personifies Anglo-Irish ambivalence: she is wooed by a young
British officer, Capt. Gerald Colthurst (David Tennant), but her
secret passion is for a childhood friend-turned-nationalist
fighter, Peter Connolly (Gary Lydon). Adding to the mood of
confused identity and frustrated love are Danielstown's house
guests, the Anglo-Irish Hugo Montmorency ( Wilson); his English
wife, Francie ( Birkin); and the Anglo-Irish Marda Norton ( Shaw),
who once loved Hugo and who now alone seems aware that the end is
nigh.
</P>
<P>
   Banville's screenplay veers from the novel by building up the
character of Peter Connolly as a counterweight to Captain
Colthurst. But it remains faithful to Bowen's portrayal of the
gradual asphyxiation of life at Danielstown as rebellion comes
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowen wrote like a filmmaker, with wonderful dialogue,
exquisite descriptions and a brilliant use of light as a
metaphor,'' Warner said, adding with a laugh, ``We tried hard not
to make it too Chekhovian.''
</P>
<P>
   The very beauty of the location, with its autumnal colors
constantly changing under rushing clouds, contributes to the
feeling of impending doom. For capturing this in the movie, Warner
credits Idziak, without whom, she said, she would have been lost.
When it came to directing actors for the screen rather than the
stage, however, her initial fears were unwarranted: the long delays
between takes as lighting was repositioned provided ample time for
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   On location, no one was better equipped than Shaw to judge how
her friend the rookie movie director was faring. ``The thing she
never did was to tell people what to do in terms of the scene,''
Shaw said. ``Say, leaving a dinner. Onstage, it could take weeks to
work out. Here it just happened. But what she does that is exactly
like in theater is to give one note to each actor, an idea that can
make all the difference, like, `You must think about what you left
behind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said she made a point of directing Hawkes since the
character of Lois _ ``so determined to be in love,'' as Marda
Norton puts it _ defines the tone of the movie. But with the
experienced actors, she admitted, she was more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did direct Michael Gambon, but he gets bored very quickly so
you have do it very quickly,'' she said. In contrast, Smith was
``incredibly open'' to suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw chimed in: ``Maggie was like a student. She was always
poring over the screenplay in the evenings, studying, studying,
studying.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner got another new experience in the editing process, which
she said was a revelation. ``I learned a lot about novel writing,
all the things a novelist holds in his mind,'' she explained. ``And
of course it's so different from theater. Here the filming is like
rehearsing and the first night is the editing.''
</P>
<P>
   So has making ``The Last September'' altered the direction of
her career?
</P>
<P>
   ``What changed my life in the last five years was being able to
move between different media, from theater to opera and now to
movies,'' she said. ``Making a movie doesn't make me want to stop
everything else, but it does make me think I can blend more.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, it is the theater that is calling again.
At the end of May, she will be directing Shaw in ``Medea'' at the
Abbey Theater in Dublin. And, as always, there will be a touch of
the experimental. The chorus in Euripides' tragedy will speak on
alternate nights in English and in Gaelic. Not that Warner speaks
Gaelic. But on Irish matters, Cork-born Shaw is always there to
keep her straight.

 &HT;    Manchester United eliminated in European Cup semis
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manchester United's ambitions to expand its dominance beyond
England this season ended Wednesday on its home pitch at Old
Trafford.
</P>
<P>
   The defending European Cup champions were beaten 3-2 by Real
Madrid and eliminated by the same aggregate score in the European
Cup quarterfinals. Three Spanish clubs are among the last four.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona, which got two extra-time goals Tuesday to prevail 5-1
over Chelsea, 6-4 aggregate, will meet Valencia, which ousted
Lazio, in the first semifinal leg on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, Real Madrid will play Bayern Munich in the other half
of the draw. The German club bested Porto 2-1, 3-2 aggregate, on a
goal by Thomas Linke in stoppage time, just moments after Porto's
Mario Jardel scored to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
   United, which controversially pulled out of the F.A. Cup to
compete in the World Club Championship, crashed out of the latter
event in group play. All that's left for the world's richest sports
club is to put the finishing touches on its sixth English Premier
League title in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid benefited from poor United defending 20 minutes in,
when Roy Keane slid to push the ball away from the near post but
instead sent it into his own goal.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Raul Gonzalez finished an electrifying
run by maneuvering around Jaap Stam to put home a 25-yard bender
for a 2-0 game. Three minutes later, in the 53rd minute, all
Gonzalez had to do was knock home an open shot, thanks to some
nifty byline work by Fernando Redondo.
</P>
<P>
   David Beckham and Paul Scholes pulled two back later on for
United, which suffered its first home loss to a Spanish club.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA CUP: DEATH THREAT CLAIMED
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray defender Gheorghe Popescu said Wednesday that he and
several teammates had received death threats, in anticipation of
tonight's second leg UEFA Cup semifinal match at Leeds. Two Leeds
fans were killed in Istanbul two weeks ago, the night before the
first leg, won 2-0 by Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Turkish club have been banned from attending the
match, and Galatasaray players will be accompanied by a Turkish
anti-terrorist brigade, for extra security.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, Arsenal plays at Lens with a 1-0
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD CUP: HAITI, T&AMP;T ADVANCE
</P>
<P>
   Haiti will play Trinidad &AMP; Tobago next month in the third round
of qualifiers in The Football Confederation, which includes North
and Central America and the Caribbean. Cuba also advanced out of
the Caribbean zone. El Salvador advanced to the third round with a
3-1 win over Belize, as Raul Diaz Arce had his third goal in as
many qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   A full round of South American qualifiers will take place
Wednesday, highlighted by Colombia at Bolivia. Peru is at Chile,
Ecuador at Brazil, Uruguay at Paraguay and Argentina visits
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling Germany and Italy are under pressure for good
showings at home Wednesday, as several Euro 2000 teams are in
action in friendlies. Germany plays non-qualifier Switzerland,
while Italy meets Portugal. Other matches include Belgium-Norway,
Denmark-Sweden, France-Slovenia, The Netherlands-Scotland and
Turkey-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia did not qualify, but will play host to the U.S. on
Wednesday in Moscow in the first visit by a senior men's American
team to the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: MONACO ROLLS TO CROWN
</P>
<P>
   As Monaco put the finishing touches on an anti-climactic race in
Le Championnat on Saturday. Dado Prso scored in stoppage time to
earn a 2-2 draw with Nancy. The title was the seventh for Monaco,
which has 62 points, 10 better than Lyon, with three matches
remaining. ... The historic win by Calais last week to reach the
French Cup finals was more than coach Ladislas Lozaro could bear.
He was hospitalized after suffering a mild heart attack as his
fourth-division club, composed mainly of amateurs, shocked reigning
French first-division champions Bordeaux 3-1. Lozaro is expected
back for the May 7 final against defending French Cup holders
Nantes.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: LIONS DOUBLE UP BAYERN
</P>
<P>
   1860 Munich has taken both Bundesliga contests with archrival
Bayern Munich this season. Bayern defender Jens Jeremies tapped in
an own-goal in a mix-up with his keeper Saturday, and the Lions won
2-1 to move into fourth place. Bayer Leverkusen crushed Arminia
Bielefeld 4-1 to take a three-point lead. ... The Deutsche Fussball
Bund, the German federation, has fined Eintracht Frankfurt nearly
$250,000 for incurring debts of nearly $7 million. But the damaging
blow is the loss of two points that will be docked at the end of
the season. Frankfurt is only one point and two spots out of the
relegation zone, despite playing better recently under new manager
Felix Magath.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA: RIVER ROLLS
</P>
<P>
   River Plate lost two players to red cards in the first half
Sunday, then got early second-half goals from Eduardo Coudet and
Leonel Gancedo to beat Gimnasia de Jujuy 2-0 to take a one-point
lead in the Clausura (closing) championship.

BILLIONS OF PAGES? THAT'S THE JOB FOR SOFTWARE READING CENSUS
FORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 30-year career, Richard Taylor, an information technology
architect with Lockheed Martin Mission Systems, has taken on some
extremely complex jobs. He has helped turn the FBI's fingerprint
files into an electronic database, designed systems for airlines
that make sure there is a gate free for every arriving flight and
developed an archive of high-quality digital images for the
National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing that Taylor has done approaches his current task:
equipping computers to make sense of the scribbles on 1.5 billion
pages from U.S. census forms, which were sent to more than 121
million households.
</P>
<P>
   The current census will be the first to use computer software to
decipher and record information rather than human eyes. Taylor
called it ``the biggest data-capture project in history,'' the
Super Bowl of handwriting recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Census Bureau must report its findings by the end of
the year, Taylor's system has about 100 days to do its job,
starting with the official Census Day, April 1. When you consider
that many people cannot even read their own handwriting, the
assignment seems that much more daunting.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two censuses, in 1980 and 1990, getting those words
off paper and into computers started with automated cameras built
by the Census Bureau. Mechanical arms in the cameras opened the
forms and smoothed the pages flat so they could be photographed for
microfilm. Computers then scanned the microfilm to make note of
which boxes had been checked on the forms. Seven thousand clerks,
working around the clock at seven processing centers, looked at the
forms and entered the remaining handwritten information into
computers.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1990 census ended, the Census Bureau was determined to
have computers do more of the job themselves, said J. Gary Doyle,
the bureau's systems integration manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty sure it would work,'' Doyle said. ``It was just
a question of how well it would work. But even if we got, say, 50
percent with character recognition, that's 50 percent less keyers
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Census Bureau will not be satisfied with a 50 percent
accuracy rate from Lockheed Martin Mission Systems, a unit of
Lockheed Martin Corp., which won the contract in 1997. The bureau
wanted 98 percent accuracy, about 3 percentage points higher than
the best accuracy rate people can achieve when typing the
information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Taylor had his choice of about seven handwriting
recognition programs. All of them operated in about the same way,
by using mathematical probabilities and pattern matching to figure
out if, for example, an individual letter was a C or an O that had
not been quite closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different recognition engines are better at different
things,'' Taylor said. ``Some are best with all uppercase; others
are better with numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   He settled on recognition software produced by a German company,
CGK Computer Gesellschaft Konstanz, partly because Lockheed
Martin's engineers had used it in other projects and knew how to
adjust it.
</P>
<P>
   But to reach the Census Bureau's accuracy target, character
recognition alone was not going to be enough. Taylor's group
decided that it had to develop custom software to identify whole
words.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the software engineers took three approaches. The
simplest one was to develop vast dictionaries of place names,
street names and occupations from past census data and from sources
like the U.S. Postal Service. In a trial run of the system that
used advance forms from South Carolina, the dictionaries quickly
proved their value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything about the educational system
there,'' Taylor said, ``but a lot of people can't spell Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   A second piece of software crosschecks data that appear more
than once. For example, it makes sure that the age given
corresponds to the date of birth entered elsewhere on the form.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of word-reading software uses a more arcane
approach called trigram analysis. The software team created a list
of every possible three-letter combination that can be made from
the alphabet. Those triplets were then compared with a database
containing all the words in a large English-language dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   From that comparison came tables that indicate the likelihood of
any particular letter combination appearing at the beginning, in
the middle or at the end of a word. Using that, the software
compares the triple-letter combinations within words (identified as
words by the other recognition software) and adjusts the accuracy
confidence ratings accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Taylor said that if the software scanned his
surname, it would increase its assessment of the recognition
software's accuracy after finding that ``tay'' was followed by
``ayl.'' By contrast, the system might reject any result that
produced the result ``zkx.''
</P>
<P>
   While the software group was working, another team developed a
system to minimize the amount of paper handling at the four data
processing centers built by Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and the
Census Bureau. At their busiest, the centers will each handle about
17 tractor-trailer loads of forms daily.
</P>
<P>
   Each form is run across a bar code reader to confirm that it was
returned by the household that received it and examined by actual
people for things like blobs of peanut butter that might gum up the
system, then fed into oven-size scanners made by Eastman Kodak.
Each scanner handles 23,400 pages a day.
</P>
<P>
   The scanners are attached to banks of Dell servers with
400-megahertz Pentium III processors running Windows NT. The data
are stored, and the handwriting recognition begins. Taylor said
that when he began work three years ago, he designed the system to
accommodate more servers as their prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   I think of servers as pigs eating out of the trough,'' he said.
``If you put more pigs in, they'll eat it up faster.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the forms have been read, the data are sent to the Census
Bureau for compilation. Both the data and the scanned images are
recorded at the processing centers onto two backup tapes, which are
stored in different locations. (All the actual paper forms will be
reduced to fine particles by shredders.)
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau will not release statistics on how the system
is performing until the count ends. But Lockheed Martin Mission
Systems estimates that it is running at about 99 percent accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   If the system has a weak link, it is the people who are still
essential to the process.
</P>
<P>
   Each center still needs clerks to type in data, although far
fewer than for previous censuses.
</P>
<P>
   If the software systems review a word and are still uncertain
about what it is, a digital image of that section of the form is
forwarded to a person, who deciphers it and types the information
into the system. If the person cannot figure out the word from the
image, which happens rarely, the actual paper form is retrieved and
examined.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was counting on the people backing up the automated
equipment, who are hired for only a few months, to produce about
6,000 keystrokes per hour, about half the industry average. But
early test runs in Baltimore showed that they were likely to do
only 4,500. ``This was a worry,'' he said. To make sure that the
Census Bureau meets its deadline, the system is initially
processing only the required information from short and long forms;
the forms will be run through again later for complete processing.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as the system may be, it is in an sense already
obsolete, rather like the printed census form itself, which dates
to 1830.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that this is the biggest paper census _ forever,''
Taylor said. His company is planning to build a similar system for
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, the Census Bureau has allowed
people to file their forms online. But the program has not been
heavily promoted, Doyle said, and may generate only about 60,000
replies. He expects online filing to be more popular in the next
census. ``Just like anything else, you'll see more and more people
doing it online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the digital world has no answer for question of how to
preserve the census data for a long time. The bureau will probably
use special digital printers, again from Kodak, that will record
the material onto old-fashioned microfilm. Independent laboratories
have certified that Kodak's microfilm will last for 500 years, and
the company says internal tests show that it is good for at least
twice that. Digital storage devices, by contrast, need to be
renewed every 10 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   But microfilm offers another advantage. In the distant future,
when Windows-based servers will be long forgotten, a simple
magnifying glass will be able to resurrect the data stored on
microfilm.  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will return to the Northeast as a front slips
southward through New York. Thickening clouds and developing
onshore winds will turn a bright morning in New England into a
dull, cool afternoon. A surge of warmer, humid air will reach the
Middle Atlantic states and Ohio Valley on a freshening breeze from
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   A strong disturbance moving east from Illinois will produce a
heavy, cold rain from Wisconsin to western New York. Farther north,
wet snow may fall in northern Michigan. To the south, powerful
thunderstorms may erupt in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys as a cold
front sweeps east.
</P>
<P>
   The Plains will be noticeably cooler with clearing in western
sections. Clouds may persist over sections of the eastern Rockies.
A jet stream disturbance moving into the west will keep ocean
clouds near the coast and trigger a few showers inland.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: CANYON WINDS
</P>
<P>
   High winds lashed much of the Southwest on Tuesday as a potent
cold front swept across the region. Wind gusts of 50 to 90 mph were
measured from northern Arizona to eastern Utah and western
Colorado. As usual, some of the strongest winds were noted in
canyons. Canyon winds get a boost in speed since air that is forced
to flow through the constriction of a mountain pass always
accelerates. The same effect can be felt in large cities as winds
whistle through urban canyons formed by large buildings.

`THE LYNCHING OF LEO FRANK': A STORY STILL PAINFUL AFTER REPEATED
TELLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day a successful play might appear about Leo
Frank, who was killed by a lynch mob after his death sentence had
been commuted to life for a murder he insisted he did not commit.
An incident that helped revive the Ku Klux Klan and was
instrumental in the founding of the Anti Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith must have some dramatic value.
</P>
<P>
   But for 85 years it has frustrated everyone who has tried to
stage it, including a team of formidable artists who created the
ill-fated musical ``Parade'' a few years ago. Perhaps the most
dramatic version was the television film ``The Murder of Mary
Phagan,'' written a dozen years ago by Jeffrey Lane and George
Stevens Jr. from a Larry McMurtry story, but even that included
ample dozing time.
</P>
<P>
   So, if ``The Lynching of Leo Frank'' is hardly destined for
eternity, at least the playwright, Robert Myers, is in better
company than most people ever get introduced to.
</P>
<P>
   And there is one 30-minute segment when one has reason to hope
he will succeed against the odds: the trial of Frank for the 1913
murder of Phagan, a 14-year-old worker in a Georgia pencil factory
where Frank was the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Myers sidesteps courtroom histrionics and even discounts glaring
gaps in testimony to concentrate on the menacing anti-Semitic
passions inspired by the prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, and the local
press. There is testimony by Frank and his principal accuser, Jim
Conley, a janitor, and brief arguments by the lawyers; there are
even rulings by a judge. But no judge or jury is seen; there are
only the antagonists and the restless mob muttering threats from
the benches or through windows and salivating at obscene slanders
that filled the air during the real trial. Parts of this scene are
inflammatory and all of it is emotionally stirring.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty verdict against Frank _ delivered in secret because
the jury was so terrified of the crowd, or so the judge said, if
you are willing to believe it _ comes like a thunderclap.
</P>
<P>
   But surrounding this brief excitement is an hour and 45 minutes
of recitation of history and judgments from many authors, confusing
stage business and outright preaching by the playwright, which no
one would listen to if they were not in a dark, closed place. There
are repetitive arguments about how racial discrimination against
blacks differed from (or did not differ from) the surge of
anti-Semitism at the time; there are instructions on pogroms in
Europe and medieval blood libel against Jews; there is even a
vaudeville skit to demonstrate popular beliefs in that era in
Georgia about Jews as landlords and moneylenders.
</P>
<P>
   Two striking elements in the story are oddly muted here: the
struggle of conscience of Gov. John Slaton, who commuted Frank's
sentence, thus arousing the lynch mob and sacrificing his own
career, and the astonishing emergence 70 years after the event of
an octogenarian, Alonzo Mann, who had been an office boy in Frank's
factory in 1913 and swore only in the 1980s that he had seen Conley
dumping Phagan's body where it was found. Here, Mann hovers around
the entire play in a wheelchair and his version of events, when it
can at last be grasped, is less than compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Barbara Vann, the director, to keep things moving
often appear more hectic than purposeful, and only a few of the
actors stand out: Christopher Gasti's Dorsey is a loathsome
political manipulator with violent ambition and no decency at all;
Evelyn Adler makes a noticeable effort to rescue Frank's wife,
Lucille, from cypherhood; Monrico T. Ward turns Conley into a
homicidal perjurer of surprising charm and Brad Russell is a
memorable Governor Slaton, even in comparison with Jack Lemmon in
that role in the television film.
</P>
<P>
   There is an odd omission in the cast listing. No credit is given
for Mary Phagan. But an actress does turn up as Phagan collecting
her last paycheck on the fateful day and being carried off dead. In
fact when her friends sing hymns around her casket, the corpse
emits a sharp keening sound. Surely that calls for a mention of the
role in the program.

   SAFRICA-AFRIKANERS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ One of the

wealthy Afrikaners under black rule. Even in a country of countless

notable. After all, the Afrikaners, who are descended from Dutch,
German and French settlers, invented the brutal system of racial
segregation known as apartheid. By Rachel L. Swarns.

<P>
   LA-EDWARDS-TRIAL (Baton Rouge, La.) _ Desperate to procure
Louisiana's final riverboat gambling license in 1997, Edward J.
DeBartolo Jr. had already delivered $400,000 in cash to his
father's old friend, Edwin W. Edwards, the former governor of
Louisiana. He had fended off suggestions that he grant consulting
contracts worth millions more to Edwards and his eldest son,
Stephen. Then, even after DeBartolo's partnership had won its state
casino license, he received another proposal, this one for a
$10,000-a-month attorney's retainer for Stephen Edwards. DeBartolo
could not have been more exasperated. ``They don't quit,'' he
complained to his closest associate, Ed Muransky. By Kevin Sack.

February. The suspect, who was identified only by his computer
handle, Mafiaboy, is accused of attacking CNN's Web site and could
face two years in prison as a juvenile. By Matt Richtel.

cautionary cliche about never saying never. He's saying never.
Shrilly. Al D'Amato become head honcho of the city that granted him
celebrity license the minute he was voted out of his 18-year stint
on Capitol Hill? Neh-vuh!
</P>
<P>
   His weak eyes fire up behind their strong eyeglasses (he was
legally blind until he had surgery in the fifth grade) and his
voice zeros in like a stinging insect to deliver an unconditional
thumbs down on resurfacing as New York's next Republican mayor
should Rudolph W. Giuliani levitate to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances would I run for the job,'' sputters the
former senator, bouncing around in his leather chair for added
oomph. ``No way, no how, no place!''
</P>
<P>
   No, sir. The turncoats who deserted him in his 1998 re-election
campaign (his only defeat in 28 years) won't have this insurance
salesman's son, now presiding over a Manhattan law office and
consulting firm well stocked with billionaire clients who seek his
advice with open checkbooks, to kick around anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, he doesn't qualify (Hillary Clinton, are you
listening?) as a true city resident. He's a Long Island bachelor
after business hours with a rented house in Lido Beach, a mere ZIP
code away from his hometown, Island Park, where he's religious
about showing up for Sunday dinners cooked by his mother,
Antoinette, an octogenarian.
</P>
<P>
   In the second place, why scale down to local when you've already
gone national?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't live in the city,'' notes D'Amato, 62, whose
socializing and womanizing skills keep him in its gossip columns,
``and I certainly wouldn't move just to put myself in position to
run.'' When he calls the office ``an onerous thing,'' he means it
as a compliment. He just doesn't need the grief.
</P>
<P>
   As for attention, which he thrives on, he still gets plenty:
he's not wearing a telegenic red tie by accident.
</P>
<P>
   He's found the lecture circuit way more fun than
speeches-on-the-stump: ``I can say whatever I want and don't have
to worry about if I offend you because I may lose your vote,'' he
says. ``And they pay me for it now! Isn't that wonderful!''
</P>
<P>
   Today D'Amato, whose cluttered desk signals an owner with a Type
AAA personality, has been to court (as special master in the
Holocaust settlement case), taped a Rudy-Hillary sound bite for Fox
Television, huddled with a new client and conducted a flurry of
negotiations in language best described as locker room legalese.
Later on, there's a taping with Paula Zahn.
</P>
<P>
   He's also sandwiched in a newspaper interview, but that doesn't
stop him from taking care of business _ much of it in histrionic
telephone soliloquies that conclude when he slams down the receiver
in lieu of a sign-off _ whenever the mood strikes, which is
constantly. Everything, including his Friday tee time and golf
lessons for the grandsons, is tackled with urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Get him! Beep him! Track him down!'' he barks at his executive
assistant, one of three female aides who call him The Senator,
exercise his Rolodex, fetch his Diet Cokes and grace his dinner
table at Manhattan restaurants on those rare evenings when he's
dateless and his buddy Donald J. Trump hasn't provided leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato reports himself recovered from his pining over the
socialite Hilary Geary, who dumped him shortly before the voters
did, but he professes he's not the party animal the news media make
him out to be. Come on, show some respect: He's a grandfather of
12!
</P>
<P>
   He's also recovered from losing his Senate seat to Charles E.
Schumer, but it stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has a bulletproof ego, no one,'' says D'Amato, whose
bluster suggests he comes close, ``but I hope I have a greater
sense of inner worth than to suggest the loss of one election
determines one's outlook on life. That would be a really sad
commentary on anybody. To think that I was going to go into some
kind of retreat zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the man who claims he ``made a difference every day''
in the Senate has gone into the attack zone. ``You think there's a
better advocate than me? There isn't!'' brags D'Amato, counting a
$2 billion merger of Bell Atlantic and Metromedia Fiber Network,
and the rescue of the moribund Islanders hockey franchise with a
$175 million offer from his friend Charles Wang of Computer
Associates, as just the tip of the iceberg in his transition from
Senator Pothole to Senior Deal Maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel dethroned,'' he says. ``I don't think I ever
acted imperial.'' Whether he ever acted with impropriety kept the
Senate Ethics Committee guessing, but D'Amato insists he's as
ethical as the next guy: ``I enjoy me; I'm a good person. But if
you're disrespectful or nasty to me, you know what I'm going to
do.'' Just ask his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The smear-fests are history. Now he and Edward I. Koch (the
Siskel and Ebert of partisan critics spar weekly for New York
magazine over a free Four Seasons lunch) are having a ball
handicapping the Giuliani-Clinton race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely preposterous that Hillary comes in on
the basis that she wants to help New Yorkers,'' D'Amato rants about
the first lady. ``She's not worried about the interests of the
homeowner in Levittown. I mean, give me a break. She's here to
launch her political career so she can run for president! That's my
opinion!''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, is there anything he doesn't have a handle on?
Just golf. ``Nobody can be as bad as me,'' pouts D'Amato, who came
to the game late in life and is desperate to make up for lost time.
``My golf pro, this poor guy,'' he says, beaming as he primes his
punch line, ``I think he's gone for psychiatric counseling.''

BRUTAL CHARM FOR BOTH PLAYERS AND SPECTATORS
</HEADLINE>
  By MARC SPIEGLER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the pyrotechnics that today's videogame programmers can
muster, the basic concept of the one-on-one fighting game has not
changed since the mid-80s era of the arcade machine called Karate
Champ: Two characters battle, one survives.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, of course, are the production values of
today's games. And when it comes to ramping up the spectacle of
gladiatorial combat, Soul Calibur represents the state of the art.
Produced by Namco for Sega's Dreamcast platform, the game offers
unparalleled beauty and speed, making it perhaps the first game to
be as much fun for spectators as for players.
</P>
<P>
   The combat is between characters with different strengths and
skills. It takes place in unenclosed fighting rings shaped like
hexagons or semicircles, and ends instantly if a player steps
outside the boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are stunning. The characters are smoothly rendered
(without the visible polygonal structure that makes most videogame
fighters resemble the Thing from ``Fantastic 4'' comic books), and
they move around the fighting arena with a mercurylike fluidity,
performing complex moves seamlessly. The game's lusciously detailed
fighting arenas mostly span the expected array of locations: a
snake-cult temple with frothing lava, a Buddhist monastery, the
ruins of a medieval castle, a Russian riverfront with minarets in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   Like most one-on-one combat games, Soul Calibur is a
third-person game _ the player's point of view is that of a
spectator, not that of the character.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than standing still, the game's ``camera'' tracks the
fight, panning around the characters. Mostly, that makes for
interesting perspectives and enhances the game's resemblance to
televised sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   At times during play, however, that camera movement seems a
little too uncontrolled, coming in so close that the player can
lose track of exactly where both characters stand in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Painstaking effort has gone into creating real-world physics.
When the swordswoman Sophitia soars high over an opponent, for
instance, her skirt does not stay stuck to her haunches like a
plastic lampshade but flutters in a Marilyn-atop-the-subway-grate
way. (If, that is, one can imagine Marilyn Monroe cracking
someone's neck between her knees, then giggling.)
</P>
<P>
   When a hapless character is knocked over the edge of the ring,
he hangs for a microsecond before falling, as if clinging to the
edge, fighting gravity. In the alpine arena, small clouds blow
across the ground, and players breathe mist out into the air.
</P>
<P>
   One major flaw: Despite its impressive game engine, all of Soul
Calibur's rings are flat. The game's main competitor, Virtua
Fighter 3tb (produced by Sega itself) offers the more interesting
possibilities of characters fighting up and down two sets of stairs
or on an inclined surface.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, at the more advanced stages of Soul Calibur's
single-player modules, one encounters obstacles like gale-force
winds, biting rats and tiny rings. But given the rendering power
and speed of the Dreamcast, it seems tragic not to include some
more challenging environments for two-person battles.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters initially available ranges from the
predictable to the perverse. Ivy, with her peroxide hair and
vampish outfit, for instance, comes from the same Goth
cyberaesthetic (rapidly becoming outdated) that gave us ``The
Matrix,'' while Maxi's open vest and Elvis pompadour do not hide
the fact that he is just Nunchaku Twirler No. 439 in the history of
fighting games.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Calibur's less human characters are more interesting.
Wielding weapons as large as their opponents' entire bodies,
Asteroth and Nightmare look like linebackers at a chess convention.
However impressive their reach and damage, these monsters move
slowly, so they are hardly invincible. Rather, they offer
characters made for the sort of player who would have preferred
Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, or Shaquille O'Neal to Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these behemoths pale by comparison with Voldo, perhaps the
oddest character ever to appear in this genre. He moves like a
go-go dancer, churning his hips in tap pants that sport a
horned-skull codpiece. His uniform involves the sort of restraint
devices one might find in a mail-order S &AMP; M catalog, leaving bare
his back and chest, which are covered in huge tribal-style tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Three blades make up each of Voldo's ``hands,'' a visual homage,
perhaps, to the title character of ``Edward Scissorhands.'' In
short, the character is a pastiche of every Satanist stereotype
imaginable. Why isn't Jerry Falwell leading an anti-Soul Calibur
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Though this game lacks the flying giblets and spewing blood of
many adult-oriented titles, it is certainly violent enough to get
on the censor's radar.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Calibur's basics are quickly mastered, allowing the player
to unleash a furious flurry of kicks, punches and attacks with
weapons. Even moves that appear dauntingly complex prove quite easy
to initiate; simply pressing two buttons while close to your
opponent will generally deliver an acrobatic assault, and more
studious gamers can use a training ground to learn such tricks
systematically.
</P>
<P>
   Those who find that process too methodical can hone their skills
through the game's mission modules, a series of challenges wrapped
around a larger quest.
</P>
<P>
   You can read the plot to the quest, but I stopped after the
first few screens, having had enough of the hackneyed prose and
story line, and just scrolled to the bottom to get my next
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in all that revenge-epic gobbledygook no doubt lies
the hidden meaning of the game's odd name, a word play on
Excalibur, the sword of Arthurian myth.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me on this one, though: the nomenclature is not a grail
worth chasing. Soul Calibur offers perhaps the finest showcase for
the Dreamcast platform so far. This game needs no plot to justify
its brutal grace.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Calibur, from Namco for the Sega Dreamcast, costs $39.99.  &QL;

DR. JOHN: ON THE STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Dr. John at the keyboards, all roads lead to New
Orleans, even the desert path of Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington's
``Caravan.'' Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) has just released an album of
Ellington tunes, ``Duke Elegant'' (Blue Note), and he is at the
Blue Note, 131 W. Third St. in Greenwich Village, through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the album, Dr. John offers New Orleans as the tourist's Big
Easy, sunny and indulgent. The music has smoothly chugging backbeat
grooves, nonchalant melodies and the casually ornate
barrelhouse-piano flourishes that place Dr. John in the great New
Orleans piano tradition. He performed with two of the musicians
from the album, David Barard on bass and Herman Ernest III on
drums, along with Renard Poche on guitar. As on the album, they
traded Ellingtonian swing for New Orleans second-line shuffles. But
in his first set on Tuesday night, Dr. John conjured a darker New
Orleans, full of shady characters and shadowy portents, where a
knowing smile masks heartbreak and troubled memories.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the shift was the song choices; Ellington material was
interspersed with Mardi Gras Indian songs like ``Iko Iko'' and
``Shoo-Fly,'' which tease at violence and misfortune, along with
Dr. John's own wry catalog of bad judgments, ``Right Place, Wrong
Time,'' and his vision of psychedelic voodoo mysteries, ``I Walk on
Gilded Splinters.'' The group played them at leisurely tempos,
maintaining a groove but peering into hidden recesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John also moved deeper into the Ellington songs. His vocals
on ``I'm Gonna Go Fishin''' (about a cheated lover vowing to cheat)
and ``Solitude'' gleamed with melancholy behind their cackling
syncopation, and Poche's guitar solos wailed the blues and jabbed
with insistent triplets. ``Perdido'' and ``Caravan,'' played on
electric organ, moved into smoky back-alley lounges, while ``In a
Sentimental Mood'' was draped with gauzy arpeggios, languid as a
Tennessee Williams courtesan. The music still spoke of good times,
but not thoughtless ones.

`RAVELSTEIN': BELLOW PLAYS BOSWELL TO A MOST EXTRAVAGANT JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As various news articles have pointed out, Abe Ravelstein, the
hero of Saul Bellow's discursive new novel, bears more than a
passing resemblance to the author's late friend and colleague Allan
Bloom. Like the author of ``The Closing of the American Mind,''
Ravelstein is a professor of political philosophy who writes a
``spirited, intelligent, warlike book'' about the decline of
liberal education in the United States, a book that unexpectedly
becomes a best seller and makes him a millionaire. Like Bloom he is
fond of quoting Plato and Rousseau and holding forth on the role of
Eros in human life. Like Bloom he is a magnetic teacher, a
demanding and dogmatic professor whose disciples are as passionate
as his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   While fingering the real-life antecedents of earlier Bellow
characters is easy enough _ Von Humboldt Fleisher in ``Humboldt's
Gift'' was based on the late poet Delmore Schwartz; Victor Wulpy in
the story ``What Kind of Day Did You Have?'' on the art critic
Harold Rosenberg _ such IDs are quite beside the point when the
imaginative alchemy of fiction is complete. This is not the case,
however, with ``Ravelstein,'' a chatty, intermittently engaging
work that feels more like a fictionalized portrait than a fully
fashioned novel.
</P>
<P>
   The book is at its most compelling when Bellow's narrator _ a
writer named Chick, who functions as an authorial stand-in _ simply
reminisces about his old friend Abe Ravelstein, memorializing his
antics, his idiosyncrasies and tastes. When Bellow tries to give
the book more of a plot, to flesh out Chick's relationship with
Ravelstein and more minor members of the cast, his efforts feel
peculiarly tentative and flaccid, as though he wasn't entirely sure
what he wanted to make of his hero's story.
</P>
<P>
   As readers of his earlier work well know, Bellow is a master
portraitist _ the best, in John Updike's opinion, writing American
fiction today _ and in these pages he uses his inimitable
raffish-lofty prose to give us a palpable sense of Ravelstein's
physical presence and mental energy. Ravelstein emerges as a
larger-than-life figure: a big, bald, chain-smoking man with a
Whitmanesque ego and Henderson the Rain King's exuberant appetite
for life.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of Bellow's heroes, Ravelstein is an intellectual
``at ease with large statements, big issues and famous men,'' but
he's also an unabashed sybarite with a taste for expensive clothes
and fine antiques. Since coming into money, he wears a $20,000
watch and sends his ties air express to a silk specialist in Paris
to be cleaned. Dismissive of students who are lazy, mediocre or
slow-witted, he is extolled by his disciples as ``the intellectual
counterpart'' to Michael Jordan, and for these chosen few, he plays
the role of father figure, confidant and confessor. His craving for
``the inside dope'' is insatiable, whether it's gossip about
friends and students or top-secret information about government
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chick, another one of Bellow's ``first-class
noticers,'' is Ravelstein's senior by some 20 years, he, too,
regards Ravelstein as a kind of teacher. When Ravelstein asks Chick
to write his biography, he reluctantly agrees to play Boswell to
his friend's Johnson. In light of recent developments, this
exchange now reads like a pre-emptive answer to critics who have
assailed Bellow for ``outing'' the late Bloom and suggesting that
he died of AIDS. The official cause, given in obituaries, was
internal bleeding and liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Ravelstein is always chiding the brooding Chick ``to get away
from the private life, to take an interest in `public life, in
politics,''' and the relationship between the two men in many ways
embodies the dynamic that has animated Bellow's work from the
beginning _ namely, the pull between the world and the self,
between ``the actual'' with all its temptations of shallowness and
distraction, and the private realm of the imagination with its
dangers of solipsism and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, Bellow never really dramatizes the
friendship of Ravelstein and Chick, never gives it the ballast of
shared history the way he did, say, with Humboldt and Citrine in
``Humboldt's Gift.'' Instead there are isolated anecdotes that fail
to gain a cumulative power: Ravelstein spilling espresso on his
brand-new $4,500 Lanvin sport coat; Ravelstein lighting up a
cigarette hours after getting out of the intensive care unit;
Ravelstein walking in on Chick's half-dressed wife, Vela.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of ruminative digressions about everything from
Rousseau's philosophy to ``the Jewish question,'' from the
pleasures of Paris to the terrors and consolations of death, as
well as some acutely observed cameo portraits of assorted
acquaintances and friends. This classic Bellovian gallery of
operators and smooth talkers includes Rakhmiel Kogon, one of
Ravelstein's former teachers, who looks like ``a nonbenevolent
Santa Claus''; a former paratrooper turned professor named Battle,
who enjoys departmental politics and making ``complex, bold, secret
Machiavellian moves''; and Radu Grielescu, a Romanian fascist who
would like to reinvent himself in the United States as an Old World
gent with an interest in archaic history.
</P>
<P>
   Compelling as many of these mini-portraits might be, they do not
sustain the narrative of this novel, which increasingly devolves
into a looping and repetitious monologue by Chick, chronicling
Ravelstein's declining health and enumerating his own medical
complaints and Herzogian problems with women.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the novel the charismatic Ravelstein no longer
holds center stage, and as he is marginalized, the book loses its
energy and focus, collapsing into a mere shell of a story _ a
portrait in which the subject has disappeared from view. Bellow
would have ended up with a better book (and doubtless done better
by his late friend) had he simply written a straightforward memoir
instead of trying, unsuccessfully, to pump up his reminiscences
into a work of fiction.

 &HT;    Key lime pie has never been more popular, but there's trouble in
the Florida groves

   FLORIDA CITY, Fla. _ On the edge of the sawgrass wilderness,
where the road to Everglades National Park takes a hard left turn,
there's an overgrown produce stand with the odd name ``Robert Is
Here'' painted across the roof like a Rock City barn.
</P>
<P>
   Robert is Robert Moehling, the thicket-bearded proprietor, whose
easy smile and roomy midsection suggest that he enjoys his work.
Among the bins of oranges and kumquats, he offers passing tourists
almost anything that can be made with Key limes: honey, syrup,
curd, cookies, fudge, milkshakes, marinade, marmalade, dip, salsa,
salad dressing, mustard, hot sauce, barbecue sauce, moisturizing
cream _ not to mention the people's choice, Key lime pie.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the products under the big shed, the most exotic may be
Key limes themselves. Moehling's were actually grown within an
hour's drive of the Keys. You can't say that about many Key limes
these days; almost all of the sour little suckers are imported from
Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Key limes are the pink flamingos of Florida food. They're a
celebrated part of local color, but the reality pales before the
reputation. Thanks to hurricanes and disease and encroaching
development, the state hasn't produced a crop to speak of since the
1950s. Nowadays, most Florida-grown Key limes are plucked from
stray trees in people's yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here three years, and I haven't seen a Key lime tree
yet,'' says Dolphus Broxton, the head of marketing for Brooks
Tropicals in Homestead, Florida's largest lime supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic limes are particularly scarce this year. The citrus
canker, a blight that makes fruit fall prematurely and can kill a
tree, has swept through the flat, steamy fields south of Miami,
from where 90 percent of the limes grown in the United States come.
Half of Florida's lime groves have been bulldozed and burned, and
the canker may not be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I've known all my life are losing everything. It's a
hurtful thing to watch,'' Moehling says, as he sorts navel oranges
in back of the produce stand. Off in the distance, a column of
smoke rises in the cloudless sky _ another infected grove going up
in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Key limes account for very few of the fresh limes consumed in
the United States. The ones you usually see in the grocery store
are Persians, a seedless hybrid picked early so the fruit will look
as green as a new lawn.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Key limes look like confused lemons. They're
smaller than a golf ball, with yellow-green skin sometimes
splotched with brown. They yield seeds and a pallid juice that's
considerably tarter than that of the Persians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Coke and Pepsi _ they just taste different,''
Moehling says.
</P>
<P>
   The higher pucker quotient makes Key limes perfect for the pie
that food writer Craig Claiborne once called his favorite American
regional dessert. The fruit's acid balances the sweetened condensed
milk used in almost all Key lime pie recipes, interacting with the
protein to form a custardlike consistency. The condensed milk
tradition dates from the 1800s, when canned milk was the only kind
available on the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   As any chef can tell you, fresh Key limes make a far tangier
pie. But they can be hard to find outside of Latin groceries and
the larger farmers markets. Most home piemakers rely on bottled
juice instead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oldest and most popular brands is Nellie and Joe's.
It began in Key West during the 1940s when two Cubans, Nellie and
Joe Suarez, started selling hand-squeezed juice in recycled Coke
bottles. Today a Canadian owns the company and imports the juice
from Mexico, where the limes are pressed and the squeezings
concentrated and then shipped to a processing plant in Key West to
be reconstituted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sent a truckload to Atlanta,'' says the owner, Rod
Millar, referring to one of his biggest customers, the Edwards
Baking Co. in Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, at Kenny's Key Lime Pies in Smyrna, a former
bartender named Kenny Burts has built a thriving business supplying
premium pies to restaurants such as the Longhorn Steakhouse chain.
He uses nothing but fresh Key limes _ 96 tons of them last year.
Hardly any came from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Key lime doesn't have to come from the Keys,'' Burts says.
``Some of the best Key limes I've ever tasted came from Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, most people in this hemisphere don't even call
them Key limes. In Latin America, where cooks use them in
everything from salad to ceviche, they're known as Mexican or West
Indian limes. Whatever they're called, all limes originated in
Southeast Asia and came to the New World with the Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when limes were a larger slice of Florida
agriculture. Before Hurricane Andrew struck in 1992, more than
10,000 acres of south Dade County were planted in limes. The storm
leveled much of them, and the acreage dwindled by two-thirds. Fewer
than a dozen growers still cultivate limes on any scale, all of
them within a few miles of each other in the fertile truck farming
region around Florida City and Homestead. Only one of the growers
bothers with Key lime trees, which have sharp thorns and can be the
devil to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Yamamura wears a worried expression on his thin,
bespectacled face as he rides around inspecting his groves. The
owner of Limeco _ the word is stitched in green on his knit shirt _
he immigrated from Japan during the '50s and worked his way up from
field work. Today he plants 290 acres of limes, five of them in Key
limes _ the largest plot in the state.
</P>
<P>
   He stands to lose most of it to the canker.
</P>
<P>
   The wind- and rain-borne disease first appeared 4 1/2 years ago
in a yard near Miami International Airport and has spread into five
counties at the southern tip of Florida. To contain the blight, the
state is examining groves and marking exposed trees with red paint.
Every plant within 1,900 feet has to be destroyed. No replanting is
allowed for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' Yamamura says, coming to a halt on the edge of
a 25-acre stand of Persian limes. ``I've got 4,700 trees in here,
and they're all going to be destroyed because of this one tree.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses over a branch flecked with red paint and holds a leaf
between his index finger and thumb. The green is perforated by
brown circles, as if someone stubbed out a cigarette. Limes dangle
like Christmas ornaments from the rest of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that fruit,'' he says. ``I can't pick any of it. It makes
me want to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun is sinking into the Everglades as Yamamura leaves the
grove, stopping to wash his hands and spray the underside of his
Chevy Blazer with germicide. Andrew flattened all this land; the
replanted trees have taken six years to reach maturity. Now this.
No wonder Yamamura says he could use a drink. So he drives down the
road to a sports bar he owns in Homestead and settles into a front
booth with a gin and tonic, a plate of catfish and a piece of Key
lime pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay in the packing business,'' he says, ``but I'll
probably sell my land and import my limes.'' He stares into his
glass, then picks out the lime wedge and gives it a hard twist, as
if it were a chicken neck instead of a slice of citrus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 66. At my age, I won't be replanting again.''

 &HT;    Green won't fly in this pie

   Rod Millar, who bottles Nellie and Joe's Key lime juice, was at
a food show in Boston recently when someone brought him a slice of
Key lime pie. He took one look at the bright green filling and
winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't make myself take a bite,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Floridians and other purists recognize several permissible
variations in Key lime pie. You can use a pastry shell or graham
cracker crust. You can add eggs or not. If you don't use eggs, you
don't necessarily have to bake it.
</P>
<P>
   Under no circumstances, however, should you add green food
coloring. The filling of authentic Key lime pie is a wan yellow.
While some restaurants dye it green to distinguish it from lemon
pie, we discourage that sort of flimflammery in Georgia. Florida is
too close; we don't want to hear them laughing at us.

   One of the attractions of Key lime pie is simplicity; it's one
of the easiest desserts to make. This recipe is the classic
version. We tested it with fresh Key limes and regular Persian
limes; the latter was a pale imitation of the former. If you must
use Persians, throw in a teaspoon of zest to intensify the flavor.

   1 9-inch graham cracker crust
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine the yolks and condensed
milk in a medium-size bowl, and mix well. Add lime juice a little
at a time and beat until the filling is smooth and creamy. Pour
into crust, and bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Serve
thoroughly chilled, topped with whipped cream and garnished with
lime slices.

 &HT;    ANANOVA, WORLD'S FIRST CYBER-ANCHOR, DEBUTS ON THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (l) lifestyle categories

<P>
   LONDON _ Ruffled only slightly by opening-day butterflies,
Ananova set out Wednesday to prove to the world that she is not
just another talking head.
</P>
<P>
   Well, technically, she doesn't have a head, and she isn't
talking a great deal yet. But, Ananova, who is billed as the
world's first virtual newsreader, blinked, smiled and even gave the
bad news with proper solemnity in her successful Internet debut.
</P>
<P>
   Her British creators say this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a lot more than a talking head that reads the news,''
said Mark Hird, the man behind the face at Ananova Ltd. ``She's a
computer with a face in front of it, not a face with nothing much
behind it. It's a phenomenal information resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Ananova can be accessed on the Internet with the click of a
mouse at: www.ananova.com.
</P>
<P>
   She reads stories fed to her by computers linked to worldwide
news organizations. In addition to virtual newscasts, users can
arrange to receive tailored e-mails with Ananova reading everything
from sports scores to stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure she doesn't giggle while giving the details of a
plane crash, her producers press buttons to make her facial
expression match the tone of what she is reading.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, her emotive responses are slightly herky-jerky, and
her expressions seem to run the gamut only from A to B. Sometimes,
the vagaries of the Internet make her appear to wink _ or is that
on purpose?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ananova will follow you everywhere _ at least
everywhere you go with a cellphone. ``Before long you won't have to
tap in letters and numbers to interact with her,'' Hird said.
``You'll speak to her and she'll
</P>
<P>
   understand you, because that's the future that she's been
created for.''
</P>
<P>
   She was designed to be good company. Her face _ with big green
eyes, a prim nose and pert short hair with green highlights _ is an
amalgam of pleasant young female visages. She has a neutral
American-sounding
</P>
<P>
   accent described by her handlers as ``mid-Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ananova is 28 years old _ and unlike real newsreaders, never
will grow old _ a clear advantage in a business that worships
youth. The perfect employee, she will never demand a raise, a new
contract or a show of her own to showcase her talents.
</P>
<P>
   Ananova and her creators are coy about the origin of her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My creators say it is a unique name for a unique personality,
but that doesn't stop people guessing!,'' Ananova said on her
Website. ``I don't mind people
</P>
<P>
   interpreting it in different ways, but my creators tell me they
want it to become synonymous with live breaking news and
information.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the cyber-anchor is touchy about the use of shortened
forms of her name. ``Keep it Ananova. Otherwise I start blowing a
few circuits,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she gets a body _ which her designers say is in the works _
it will be a slender 5-foot-7. Designers in Britain are vying for a
chance to be her designer.
</P>
<P>
   Ananova was developed by Britain's Press Association news
agency, which has gone so far as to rename its new media division
Ananova Ltd. The company said Wednesday's launch went smoothly,
even though
</P>
<P>
   Ananova apologized for a slow response at one point during the
day when her Website had been overwhelmed by hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ananova wants to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no bimbo,'' she told CBS news in an interview. ``The
world's going to be full of virtual this and thats.
</P>
<P>
   The point about me is that I'm not just a talking head that
reads the news. As your personal information assistant, I can alert
you to news you need to know. I can even tell you what's on at the
theater and book your tickets.
</P>

 &HT;    CENSUS BUREAU SAYS RESPONSE TO LONG FORM FELL
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau reported Wednesday that the
mail-in response rate for its long form, used to collect data
crucial to administering major federal programs, fell significantly
from 1990's rate.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-census rhetoric from politicians was partly to blame,
census officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-question long form, delivered last month to one in six
U.S. households, became the target of talk-show hosts, Internet
chat sites and Republican Party leaders who said some of the
questions were intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   While the once-a-decade head count is mandated by the
constitution and all questions are approved by Congress, Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, among others, suggested that Americans should not have
to answer questions they believe violate their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials believe the controversy in recent weeks had a
chilling effect on their efforts to convince Americans to answer
and return their forms. Most of America's 120 million households
received the short form, with eight basic questions.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday that the
rhetoric ``needlessly put the Census Bureau in the crossfire''
between the government's vital need to collect data and public
concerns about privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census-as-a-civic-duty message was compromised for those
who received the long form. A garbled message was sent that somehow
statistical information threatens privacy,'' said Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal statistics are not about individuals, therefore they
are not about privacy,'' he said. ``I believe that this elemental
distinction got lost in the public discussion and that the return
rate on the long form suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Census questions are intended to gather data called for by law
or judicial rulings. The numbers are used to apportion seats in
Congress and to fairly distribute about $185 billion in federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Only 54 percent of households that received the long form had
returned them to the Census Bureau by the end of the day Monday,
compared to 60 percent who returned them during the same period in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The return rate for the short form remained roughly the same, at
66 percent this year and 66.8 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall places more pressure on the census-takers as they
enter the next phase of the count. On April 27, 500,000 census
workers will go into the field for follow-up operations where they
visit households that did not mail back their forms.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials will be closely monitoring that effort, which
continues through mid-summer, to gauge whether the reluctance among
some Americans to respond will result in active resistance to the
census-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to collect the statistics could threaten the quality of
data in some parts of the country and have consequences on state
redistricting and federal funding, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was an encouraging sign that over all, about
two of every three households returned their forms, ending a
three-decade slide in response to the census.
</P>
<P>
   The initial response period, which ended Tuesday, showed that 65
percent of households returned their forms, equal to the 1990 rate.
In 1970, 78 percent of Americans returned their forms and 75
percent returned them in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the result reverses a ``decades-long decline in
meeting our civic responsibility,'' noting that the Census Bureau
and the Government Accounting Office had expected the response rate
to fall to as low as 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in coordinating the $6.8 billion count, which included an
extensive, prime-time advertising campaign, the Census Bureau had
hoped for a 70 percent national response this time. Only 15 percent
of local governments _ about 6,000 cities, counties and tribal
lands _ increased their 1990 response rate by 5 percent of more.
Among them was Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt called the 70 percent national target an ambitious goal
that the Census Bureau probably never had a hope of achieving. But
he said the response rate probably would have risen above 65
percent had the public debate not cast a cloud over the agency's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Texas and Florida each matched their response rates
from 1990, with Georgia at 63 percent, and Florida and Texas at 61
percent. Colorado increased its response rate one point, to 68
percent. North Carolina dropped two points, falling from 63 percent
to 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio recorded one of the largest slides, from 75 percent in 1990
to 70 percent this time. It joined a number of other states in the
Midwest which fell dramatically, though they remain at or above the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said they had not had time to analyze the
results of specific localities and demographic groups to determine
why the response rate fell sharply in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, states in the South and West followed an historic
pattern of falling below the national average. Demographers believe
the result stems from the rapid growth and more mobile society in
the Sun Belt and the higher proportion of new immigrants, factors
that make the regions harder to count.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau will being targeting specific areas with
lower-than-expected response rates with a new round of ads. Prewitt
also called on public officials to support the efforts of the
door-to-door census takers.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that some Republicans on Capitol Hill were backing
away from the issue, the Senate last week quietly shelved a
nonbinding resolution that had passed on April 7 urging that ``no
American will be prosecuted, fined or in any way harassed by the
federal government'' for not answering certain questions on the
form.
</P>
<P>
   Under law, the Census Bureau cannot share the identifying
information on the form with any other government agency or private
organization. But most polls show that a majority of Americans,
whether they are inclined to return their forms or not, do not
believe that the government's vows of confidentiality.

BOOK TALK: WILL PUBLISHING BEST THE WEB? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Book publishing always seems to be at the abyss.
Well, the responsibilities do lie heavy on publishers in this
cyber-age, and what awaits them no one knows. Two
much-commented-upon articles have appeared recently in prominent
publications questioning the viability of the traditional houses as
the progenitors and repositories for authors' work.
</P>
<P>
   One, by Michael Wolfe in New York magazine, tumbles off the
tabletop with the speed of a derailed toy train into this
generalized syllogism: Publishers haven't the necessary
technological skills or the distribution edge in an electronic age
(major premise); publishing needs high-tech knowledge and
sophisticated distribution (minor premise); publishing as we know
it doesn't have either and will disappear in two years
(conclusion). Further, while a case can be made that the art of
editing has declined, Wolfe's other deduction also seems a bit
embellished: Editors don't edit and marketers don't market;
publishing consists of editing and marketing; publishing as we know
it will disappear in two years. (His only caveat is that the stock
market must remain strong to support the transformation.)
Publishers certainly find this gloomy forecast vexatious, if not
unsophisticated. The other article is a sprawling exegesis in The
New York Review of Books written with an elegant and somewhat
self-acknowledging charm by Jason Epstein, a legendary book editor,
now mostly retired. Epstein circles from his doomsday pronouncement
of the imminent obsolescence of the large conglomerate publishing
houses, brought about by the World Wide Web, to the positive return
of publishing to ``diverse, creative, autonomous units.'' In short,
the Web that destroys will also re-create publishing's mythic
yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers by tradition are notoriously apprehensive about
change, and become particularly agitated about technological
alternatives that challenge the tried and the true. Large
publishing houses are rolling in cash, and some are investing in
the Web and digital technology. And the scale of publishing has
changed. A best seller in the old days was numbered in the tens of
thousands but is now measured in the hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say that the fact that the new technology allows
anyone to sit at his kitchen table at night and write his book and
disseminate it worldwide doesn't mean the end of publishing but
merely that a new definition of the term will evolve. ( Epstein
said it means, among other things, that sales, shipping and
warehousing can be assigned to specialist firms.) If, for instance,
there are 150,000 books available on the Web, somebody will have to
guide potential readers to what's worth buying and what is not.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, publishers point out that whatever the evolution of
the reading format _ whether one downloads a book in his computer
or onto another reading device _ there is still the need for the
content provider, and they are even gambling that the hunger for an
eclectic variety of material means they will be able to keep many
imprints in the new age. Which certainly may be wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the discussion gets back to the basics of book
publishing, editing and marketing, and, despite the industry's fear
of change, surprisingly many publishers and editors are sanguine
about what the Internet can do for their own craft. In that, many
take Epstein's article seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Galassi, publisher and editor in chief at Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, said that ``the publisher's role in the cyberspace
age will be to discriminate, and the editing and the marketing are
going to able to provide that discrimination for readers.'' Many of
``the old-fashioned values that Jason talks about,'' he said, ``are
still operative in publishing. We were always serving different
masters. I don't think it was so easy to publish great literature
way back. When we have 100,000 copies of `Beowulf' in print,
something is not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you predict how publishing is going to be in two
years?'' he added. ``The smart conglomerates will have small
publishing units to produce diverse books.'' Like Epstein, he finds
the Internet a positive force that, among other benefits, will
become the most efficient means to sell books.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Menaker, senior literary editor at Random House, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Jason's predictions about the Internet
restoring what he considers some of the more desirable aspects of
publishing _ seeing it as a sport or a game rather than a business
_ makes a good argument for taking risks or not. But I go with
Jason that there's the real opportunity for the revitalization of
what has become a cumbersome thing. I don't think the role of the
editor and the publicist and the marketer is going to be
eliminated. You will need people to help get the work into the
right hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Books ``will no longer be imprisoned for life within fixed
bindings,'' Epstein wrote, and many will be delivered
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Menaker agrees, but said: ``I don't know what the market share
of book-books will be, 25 percent, 75 percent, but people will
never stop treasuring them. They look good and feel good and they
are real things in the real world, existing in real space.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwyn Applebaum, publisher of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group,
said that his colleagues certainly ``are embracing the new digital
technology and exploring all its exciting possibilities.'' He said
that publishing was changing, without doubt, but for the moment
``and probably for quite some moments to come, the traditional
publishers are still giving authors and readers their best chance
at finding one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I looked the only `digits' that really count are
the 10 digits a reader uses to hold something to read,'' he said.
``Right now, those who choose to read are choosing to wrap their
digits around a bound book.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Galarraga's return an inspiration to cancer community
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was like a movie, Andres Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   In the third at-bat of his first regular-season game after a
year spent battling cancer, Galarraga hit a home run. He said he
didn't have the words to express his happiness.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of people do. That home run did more than help the
Braves beat the Colorado in the season opener; it lifted up a
community of cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   They might not be studious baseball fans, but they are expert in
words like multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   They also know cancer doesn't care if you hang curve balls or
dry wall. They all relate to the road Galarraga traveled to return
to first base at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer patients, watching Galarraga's comeback _ a defensive
play that saved Opening Day; four home runs in the first six games,
including a grand slam that beat the Giants _ has been inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   He has rewritten the definition of ``hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the guys that could throw for 400 yards in a game or
catch five touchdown passes or run for three touchdowns were
heroes,'' said Kim King, the former Georgia Tech quarterback and
radio analyst who has cancer in his back. ``But true heroes are
people that do things under pressure, with grace and style.
Galarraga, he's a real hero.''
</P>
<P>
   King was home watching the Braves' opener a couple of weeks ago.
When Galarraga put Pedro Astacio's fastball into the
left-centerfield seats in the seventh inning, tears filled King's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just bawling like a baby,'' King, 54, said. ``Chills
were going up and down my spine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of triumph and joy that only someone who has had
to endure chemotherapy or radiation, or both, could comprehend
fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great victory, because I can share with what
he's been through this last year,'' King said. ``All the chemo and
the sickness and all the side effects you go through. And all the
pain and the discomfort of the back. It makes you feel like a dog.
To see him come back and do that was just great.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, King kept feeling a pain in his back while playing
golf. ``Like an idiot, I guess, my football training told me you're
supposed to play through pain,'' he said. But he fell to his knees
after hitting a drive and couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   The first doctor he saw told him it was bone spurs, nothing to
worry about. Then it got worse, and his personal doctor discovered
a crushed vertebra. Further tests revealed worse news.
</P>
<P>
   ``They diagnosed me in June, saying that I had multiple
myeloma,'' King said. ``It's a blood cancer that manifests itself
in tumors and in the bone system, primarily in the hip and spine.''
</P>
<P>
   King began intense treatments right after the Fourth of July. He
just finished his second bone-marrow transplant. ``I'm pretty well
finished with the real heavy treatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors are encouraged with his progress. ``My back is
pretty well healed,'' King said. ``I'm able to do a lot of the
things that I was doing before, but not as well. I'm not able to
play golf the way I used to, but I can play golf and do some
hunting and things like that. I haven't responded like Galarraga
has.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he admires Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he symbolizes is, if you catch (that you have)
cancer early enough, you have a very good chance of beating it or
at least containing it to where you can lead a full, productive
life,'' King said. ``The key for me was having regular annual
checkups.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga might not understand how big a symbol he has become.
But he got a clue during spring training. On March 5, before the
Braves' exhibition against Tampa Bay, he was visited by youngsters
fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
   They sat in the dugout talking baseball. And cancer. Mark
Daugherty, 7, treated for leukemia since he was 2, wanted to know
all the details of Galarraga's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andres answered every question and pinpointed where it was,''
said Steve Daugherty, Mark's father. ``He talked about the
radiation and the chemo that he had. He said he did lose his hair,
just like Mark, and it was a little painful. He did get a little
sick. The same thing Mark goes through every week.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a boost to the boy, who plays soccer and practices even
on days that he gets chemo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of seeing some of the successes that he has been
around and, obviously, the Andres thing, he doesn't miss a
practice,'' Steve said.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-tennis pro, Steve said he thinks that Galarraga's example
helps the mental attitude of cancer patients, which may play a
significant part in recovery. ``It's probably 49 percent as
important as the 51 percent of the medical side of it,'' he said.
``You've got to be positive and upbeat every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Guthrie, at 58 ``too damn young for this,'' is trying
desperately to be positive and upbeat, but some days it's just not
there. The former lineman for Tech and the San Diego Chargers has a
brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a glyoblastoma in a stage four, which is the worst
you can have,'' Guthrie said. ``Isn't that the way hurricanes come
in, stage fours or fives? This is worse. It's a turbulent stage.''
</P>
<P>
   At Thanksgiving, his left arm went numb and paralyzed. He has
been undergoing treatment since December, radiation since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say the worst is behind me. I don't even know
that,'' Guthrie said. He recently built a golf driving range in
Atlanta to operate with his children, but his future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the beacon of hope in a Braves uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galarraga's situation is an inspiration to me to hang on and
work hard to get back to the position he's in, but I don't know
with a brain tumor if I'm going to get there,'' Guthrie said. ``I
know he had a tumor on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a hell of a year playing baseball,'' he said.
``It's miraculous, isn't it? I imagine he's giving a lot of people
a lot of hope. For a lot of people with cancer, there ain't a lot
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Norma Campbell, 35, is bursting with hope and happiness now that
her eight-month battle with breast cancer is nearing a successful
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly how Galarraga feels,'' Campbell said. ``Like a
giant, like he can conquer the world, like nothing else can bother
you or tear you down. I share how he feels right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She also shares how he felt when he was diagnosed. ``I was
diagnosed in September. I was only 35. No one in my family had had
it,'' Campbell said. ``I was too young to even go for the
mammograms because they say start at age 40. It was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who works in a medical office, had her last treatment
last week. She said she feels like a new person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer for me has been more like a blessing and I would have
never traded it,'' she said. ``I know it sounds kind of crazy. It's
got me so in tuned with myself. That's why I say I can relate to
how Galarraga feels. It's like a rebirth. You come out fighting.
The small things in your life are nothing anymore. It's been a good
thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did not share a common disease, Campbell probably never
would have heard of Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't follow baseball that much,'' she said,
``but the fact that he had the non-Hodgkins lymphoma, that sparked
me to get into what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she thinks she will finish the novel that she has been
writing for three years. ``I think that the Lord kind of brought me
through this because I was really struggling with a character that
was supposed to have gone through this illness. That's probably
crazy, but since the day I finished my treatment, I have been
writing like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the colon cancer that he was diagnosed with in
December, Nick Peterson, 35, can't hang dry wall anymore. But he is
battling back, inspired by what Galarraga has done and by his two
children, Ashley, 13, and Mitchell, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to raise my young-uns,'' Peterson said, ``so I want
to be around a little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's been encouraged by a surgery that removed a foot and
a half of his colon and chemotherapy that has reduced seven tumors
on his liver to one. It hasn't been an easy battle. ``Just the
thought of going through the chemo on Fridays makes me sick to my
stomach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former baseball player, he appreciates what Galarraga has
done. ``It's unbelievable, really,'' Peterson said. ``I didn't
think he was going to play baseball again. He sure has proved
everybody wrong, hasn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Klodnicki identifies with Galarraga's status as a survivor.
Her lung cancer has been in remission for two years. The teacher's
aide dedicates a lot of her time to a cancer-support group at the
Catholic Church of St. Ann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, as soon as they're diagnosed with cancer, think
it's a death sentence,'' Klodnicki, 43, said. ``I want them to
realize that there's hope. I'm trying to show that it can be
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Galarraga, whom she cheered in that first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Galarraga's doing a great job of it, going out there
and playing ball like he's never been sick,'' Klodnicki said.
``People always call it being sick. Well, I was never sick. I just
had cancer.''

you can have,'' Guthrie said. ``Isn't that the way hurricanes come
in, stage fours or fives? This is worse. It's a turbulent stage.''
</P>
<P>
   At Thanksgiving, his left arm went numb and paralyzed. He has
been undergoing treatment since December, radiation since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say the worst is behind me. I don't even know
that,'' Guthrie said. He recently built a golf driving range in
Atlanta to operate with his children, but his future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the beacon of hope in a Braves uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galarraga's situation is an inspiration to me to hang on and
work hard to get back to the position he's in, but I don't know
with a brain tumor if I'm going to get there,'' Guthrie said. ``I
know he had a tumor on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a hell of a year playing baseball,'' he said.
``It's miraculous, isn't it? I imagine he's giving a lot of people
a lot of hope. For a lot of people with cancer, there ain't a lot
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Norma Campbell, 35, is bursting with hope and happiness now that
her eight-month battle with breast cancer is nearing a successful
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly how Galarraga feels,'' Campbell said. ``Like a
giant, like he can conquer the world, like nothing else can bother
you or tear you down. I share how he feels right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She also shares how he felt when he was diagnosed. ``I was
diagnosed in September. I was only 35. No one in my family had had
it,'' Campbell said. ``I was too young to even go for the
mammograms because they say start at age 40. It was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who works in a medical office, had her last treatment
last week. She said she feels like a new person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer for me has been more like a blessing and I would have
never traded it,'' she said. ``I know it sounds kind of crazy. It's
got me so in tuned with myself. That's why I say I can relate to
how Galarraga feels. It's like a rebirth. You come out fighting.
The small things in your life are nothing anymore. It's been a good
thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did not share a common disease, Campbell probably never
would have heard of Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't follow baseball that much,'' she said,
``but the fact that he had the non-Hodgkins lymphoma, that sparked
me to get into what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she thinks she will finish the novel that she has been
writing for three years. ``I think that the Lord kind of brought me
through this because I was really struggling with a character that
was supposed to have gone through this illness. That's probably
crazy, but since the day I finished my treatment, I have been
writing like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the colon cancer that he was diagnosed with in
December, Nick Peterson, 35, can't hang dry wall anymore. But he is
battling back, inspired by what Galarraga has done and by his two
children, Ashley, 13, and Mitchell, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to raise my young-uns,'' Peterson said, ``so I want
to be around a little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's been encouraged by a surgery that removed a foot and
a half of his colon and chemotherapy that has reduced seven tumors
on his liver to one. It hasn't been an easy battle. ``Just the
thought of going through the chemo on Fridays makes me sick to my
stomach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former baseball player, he appreciates what Galarraga has
done. ``It's unbelievable, really,'' Peterson said. ``I didn't
think he was going to play baseball again. He sure has proved
everybody wrong, hasn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Klodnicki identifies with Galarraga's status as a survivor.
Her lung cancer has been in remission for two years. The teacher's
aide dedicates a lot of her time to a cancer-support group at the
Catholic Church of St. Ann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, as soon as they're diagnosed with cancer, think
it's a death sentence,'' Klodnicki, 43, said. ``I want them to
realize that there's hope. I'm trying to show that it can be
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Galarraga, whom she cheered in that first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Galarraga's doing a great job of it, going out there
and playing ball like he's never been sick,'' Klodnicki said.
``People always call it being sick. Well, I was never sick. I just
had cancer.''

 &HT;    RENO DEFENDS HER HANDLING OF THE ELIAN CASE
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. With CUBA-ELIAN. Moving in (w) Washington and (a)
national categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A beleaguered Attorney General Janet Reno defended
her handling of the Elian Gonzalez case Wednesday, but conceded
that others in the Justice Department disapprove of her tactics in
trying to reunite the 6-year-old refugee with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid violence,
if the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid that little boy
being hurt or being snatched in a way that can scar him further, I
plead guilty,'' Reno said at her weekly meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time,'' she said, ``I'm going to enforce the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Reno said the Justice Department would ``abide
by'' an appeals court ruling that extended an order keeping Elian
in this country. However, she said the ruling ``does not preclude
me from placing Elian in his father's care while he is in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At the earlier session, Reno replied to rumblings that she had
become too emotionally involved in the months-long federal effort
to wrest the child from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``high-ranking officials,'' the Washington Post reported
Tuesday that some of the attorney general's colleagues wonder
whether she has lost her way in a frustrating case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I'm going,'' Reno responded.
</P>
<P>
   However, she acknowledged that there is disagreement even within
her agency over her intense personal involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something that is of this magnitude, you're
going to hear from people who have differing views,'' Reno said.
``I want people to speak their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The case stirs echoes of the most traumatic episodes in Reno's
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution of the Elian case hinges on Janet Reno's inner
conflicts, her Waco flashbacks, and her post-traumatic-stress
syndrome from the Miami riots during her time as prosecutor
there,'' opined New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   This week marks the seventh anniversary of the fire at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in which members of an
armed religious sect died when their compound burned after a siege
by federal agents. Although she accepted responsibility, Reno later
acknowledged that she was not informed of all the actions
undertaken by FBI agents at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   With Elian's relatives in Miami resisting his return and
protective anti-Castro demonstrators surrounding the house where he
is staying, many believe a violent confrontation could result if
federal agents are sent in to seize the boy.
</P>
<P>
   As with Waco, President Clinton has turned the Elian affair over
to his attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel her loneliness,'' observed Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, federal agencies have repeatedly extended the
deadline for Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, to surrender the
boy. Last week, Reno took the extraordinary step of flying to Miami
to meet with family members. Controversy intensified when she left
without securing his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard more comments about that,'' Reno said. ``Somebody
said I did the right thing. Somebody said I did the wrong thing.
Somebody said I was too personally involved. Somebody said I was
too remote.''
</P>
<P>
   She then referred to a quotation from Abraham Lincoln that she
keeps on her office wall: ``If the end brings me out right, what
people said about me won't make any difference. And if the end
brings me out wrong, 10 angels saying I was right won't make any
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the best advice for us all in these
circumstances,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Wednesday that her strategy to conclude the Elian
saga, which some have criticized as timid, have not been unduly
influenced by her past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these situations you try to draw from experience,'' she
said. ``But each case is different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Waco, you had people who had killed federal officers and
who had injured others. You had people who had not only defied the
law but killed people in the process,'' she said. ``There's a lot
of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the much-televised video in which Elian told his
father that he did not want to return to Cuba ``made me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a wonderful little boy, by all accounts. His father had
a role in raising him. His father cares a great deal about him,''
Reno told reporters. ``He has been under the most stressful of
conditions, beginning with this most stressful of all, floating in
the ocean. It is so important that all of us turn off the TV
lights, stop writing on your papers, start thinking about a little
boy and getting his life to some permanent resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   She wondered aloud about some critics who said the government
should have moved sooner to take Elian from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed somebody said that we should have done it when it
wasn't an unusual case,'' Reno said. ``I think anybody who has
followed this case from the beginning understands that it has never
been a usual case.''

ARCHITECTS GOING NATIVE IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany, Britain, Puerto Rico, Mass.)  By RAUL A. BARRENECHE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Maria Rossi's search for a fulfilling
career took her around the world _ and home again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, fresh from Cornell's architecture school, she headed to
Europe to look for work. She spent a year and a half in the Berlin
office of the British architect James Stirling, where she labored
quietly, speaking not a word of German.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: London, and a year with the design doyenne Zaha
Hadid. Rossi's peripatetic path took her to New York, but she was
put off by the grim recession-era job prospects and quickly moved
on _ to Washington, and a tour with the interior designer Jose
Solis Betancourt, a former classmate. Then it was back to Berlin
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   After her globe-trotting, it was time to solo. Not in London,
Berlin or New York, rubbing shoulders with the giants in her
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi headed back to her native land: Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those years I was a stranger in strange places,'' Rossi,
36, recalled. ``I kept jumping around, establishing very
superficial connections wherever I went. Ultimately, it's very hard
to understand idiosyncrasies that aren't yours, especially when
you're doing something as culturally dependent as architecture.''
Being from Puerto Rico, she said: ``I'd never had to build
12-inch-thick walls like you do in cold climates like Germany's. I
just didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone in her thinking. Many young Puerto Rican-born
designers who study and work on the United States mainland or
abroad are giving up jobs there with prestigious firms to work on a
tiny Caribbean island of 3.5 million people. For some, moving back
means an opportunity to build on the island's strong Modernist
tradition; for others, it is a chance to address polemical issues
of nationalism and identity in design. Most agree that it is easier
to hang out their shingle in a place where they have friends and
family. Whatever the motivations, there's something profoundly
comforting about coming home.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when times are flush. In Puerto Rico, as on the
mainland, the economy is strong. There is no shortage of clients
willing to foot the bill for a beachfront high-rise apartment or a
rambling manse on a secluded hillside. Some are affluent New
Yorkers with connections to the island, or those just seeking a
vacation retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being a fertile training ground for young talent,
Puerto Rico offers a rich contemporary vernacular. It is not the
faux Spanish colonial fluff found in Florida and California, but a
budding Modernist's dream of painted concrete, perforated skins,
and buildings that appear to float on pilotis, the freestanding
columns that are an enduring legacy of Le Corbusier. Young
architects in Puerto Rico have their own strong ideas on designing
appropriate buildings for the island's climate and culture. Jose
Toro and Gonzalo Ferrer adapt International Style modernism to the
light and climate of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Toro returned to his native San Juan 11 years ago, after
spending more than a decade on the East Coast earning architecture
and urban planning degrees and working for top corporate firms,
including Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for a long time that I would never come back to
Puerto Rico,'' Toro said, though, he added, he had bouts of
homesickness while living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After his father, who was also an architect, became ill, he
returned home. He worked for a series of firms before joining
Ferrer, a Cornell graduate whose uncle had worked with Toro's
father. The original Toro-Ferrer firm had been Puerto Rico's
version of Wallace K. Harrison. Toro-Ferrer spent 40 years
designing important civic monuments, like the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico and a breezy yet elegant annex to the island's
beaux-arts-style capitol building, as well as glamorous resorts
like the Caribe Hilton. Their signature style was a
tropical-Corbusian language: painted concrete, pilotis and
playfully patterned sunscreens.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Toro, 39, and Ferrer, 31, are at the helm of an
office of eight people that is brimming with work. They are
designing a loftlike five-bedroom house in San Juan's beachfront
Ocean Park neighborhood; commercial, institutional and civic
projects; and a house in Panama. Friends are amazed at their
opportunities, Toro said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside to the bounty in their homeland: small-town
blues. ``Everyone knows everyone else,'' Toro said. ``You always
feel under the microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Toro-Ferrer created a new steel fence and concrete entry canopy
for a San Juan house designed by the original Toro-Ferrer, now
owned by a couple who relocated from Manhattan. The project was a
chance to address the original streamline design with new
influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw heavily on architecture from the 1940s and '50s, as
well as from contemporary work in Spain and Brazil,'' Toro said.
``We make spaces that let you enjoy the incredible light and
breezes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nataniel Fuster, the draw of building on the island is the
chance to deal with cultural and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home last spring after finishing a doctor of design
program at Harvard and set up shop with J.R. Davis, 47, an
architect who grew up in Puerto Rico with whom he has worked for
more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working here because it's possible to address so many
themes with one's work,'' Fuster said. ``You can wrestle with
complex issues like the Puerto Rican identity as a people. Although
Puerto Rico is technically a freely associated commonwealth of the
U.S., we consider it a nation. Architecture is ultimately a
cultural statement, a way to express a community's identity.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fuster, one way to express this identity is with design that
_ like Puerto Rico itself _ mixes styles from Europe, the United
States and elsewhere with homegrown traditions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the island, with its vociferous pro-statehood party,
despite recurring defeats of statehood referendums, reveals a
complex political and physical landscape.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, metropolitan San Juan, population 928,700, is a
bilingual version of mainland suburbia: shopping malls with Sears
and Kmart, and scores of Burger King, Walgreen and Citibank. Yet
the city also treasures its 500-year-old Spanish heritage and its
cultural and architectural traditions, which anti-statehood
islanders fear they would lose if Puerto Rico becomes the 51st star
on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan is an almost perfectly preserved enclave of
16th-century architecture. Other parts of the capital have leafy
neighborhoods with a mix of historic and contemporary homes that,
regardless of period, feature generous outdoor living and dining
rooms with natural light and ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   They give credence to Fuster's view of the island as a melange,
not a melting pot. ``The traditions of the Caribbean are a mix of
styles and architectures,'' he said. ``You could call it a mulatto
architecture or an architecture of mixing.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach is celebrated in a beachfront house he and Davis
designed in Ocean Park. The house, with separate guest wing and
large outdoor living area around a pool, and a tangle of garden at
the beach's edge, is an imprecise mix of colors, textures and
styles.
</P>
<P>
   The clean, blocky volumes say high Modernist; the muted green
and ochre paint scheme suggests Spanish colonial; the tiny punched
openings in the guest wing are vaguely Arab. The wave-patterned
patio paving is a traditional Puerto Rican technique called
arcamasa, a chunky mix of concrete, smashed clay roof tiles and
bits of broken glass typically used to pave outdoor plazas. It is
also a nod to the wavy patterns of the seaside promenade in Rio de
Janeiro of the Brazilian landscape master Roberto Burle-Marx. This
mix of multiple, unspecific influences is the kind of synthesis
that Fuster finds so compelling about building in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Rossi'S brand of Puerto Rican architecture tailors traditional
island materials to contemporary form. An airy house she is
completing for a nature-loving couple in Caguas, a 45-minute drive
from San Juan, commands the crest of a lushly landscaped hill.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sophisticated forms and spaces are contemporary,
Rossi gave the house an earthy sensibility with handcrafted
materials, many of them native. The doors and windows are capa
prieta, a local hardwood. The entry facade is a curving swath of
gorgeous reddish-orange laja, a slate quarried from tawny hillsides
of the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi and her collaborator, Brigida Hogan, 28, who is Puerto
Rican-born and Columbia University-trained, sublet a tiny corner of
Toro-Ferrer's new offices, a loftlike storefront space in San
Juan's Santurce district, a five-minute walk from the beach at
Ocean Park.
</P>
<P>
   Do they find it difficult to practice architecture, a profession
with an alarming dearth of women, in a macho Latin American
context? Not at all, Rossi said. ``Often, people's first
impressions of me are harsh,'' she said. ``Contractors have
referred to me as `esa muchacha,' a desultory `that girl.' There is
definitely strong male chauvinism in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, women have always held important positions
here, as judges, even mayor of San Juan. And there are a lot of
female architects in Puerto Rico, most of them practicing on their
own. As a woman, you just have to prove yourself a bit more here.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their geographic isolation, Puerto Ricans tend to
look abroad for design trends. For instance, they are starting to
catch the midcentury modern craze sweeping the globe. Like fans of
the sleek Richard Neutra houses in the Hollywood Hills, savvy
vintage home shoppers in San Juan are jockeying for status-symbol
houses designed by the German-born architect Henry Klumb, a modern
master of the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Rigau, dean of the architecture school at the Polytechnic
University of Puerto Rico and the eminence grise of the island's
architectural community, cautions against the casual collecting of
midcentury design as just a passing fad. ``Every age has its
particular stylistic trend,'' Rigau said.

   He appreciates the work of young firms but sees it as a first
step in improving the island's overall quality of design. ``It's
tremendously positive to see good work, but I still don't see
significant changes here,'' he said. Rigau seems resentful that
there aren't more good buildings going up in his homeland, but even
in New York, where some of the leading architects practice, there
are few opportunities to do serious architecture _ and plenty of
bad buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Will Toro, Rossi or Fuster turn out to be Puerto Rico's Frank
Gehry or Richard Meier? It is worth pointing out that titans like
Charles Gwathmey and Meier started out building small beach houses
on the East End of Long Island, and have matured into the
architects of the Guggenheim addition and the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   Toro and Ferrer have moved into larger, more important civic
projects, including working with local artists on San Juan's
ambitious new public art program, whose goal is to beautify the
city with new urban parks and large-scale sculptures. Like those
New York architects building for New York clients, Toro and Ferrer
have the home-team advantage.

 &HT;    EarthLink earnings drag due to merger
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The costs of its recent merger with onetime competitor
MindSpring pushed EarthLink Inc.'s first quarter loss, reported
Wednesday, to $108.5 million or 95 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   That's compared to a loss of $27.8 million, or 29 cents a share,
for the same quarter a year ago. These numbers include acquisition
costs of $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the cost of the acquisition is excluded, the
nation's second-largest Internet service provider had a loss of
$50.9 million, or 43 cents a share. That's 6 cents a share better
than the expected loss of 49 cents, the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call. That compares to a profit of $3.2
million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sadler, an analyst with FAC Equity in Boston, says
EarthLink ``did very well. When you merge equals like that, you
come up with issues you are not aware of, but they've done a good
job of budgeting for that.''
</P>
<P>
   First quarter revenues were up 69 percent to $219.7 million vs.
revenues of $129.9 million for the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Chief operating officer Garry Betty said the company added
340,000 new subscribers in the quarter ending March 31, giving it
about 3.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Of that number, roughly 45,000 were broadband customers,
representing a 400 percent increase over the first quarter of 1999,
and an 80 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McQuary, EarthLink president, said: ``If you look back a
year ago, there was a lot of doubt we'd even be able to participate
in broadband. With the advent of DSL providers opening up their
wires, we've not only been able to participate but become one of
the leaders in broadband deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Customer churn _ or the number of customers that leave the
service, was 5 percent, higher than the company would like. McQuary
attributed the defections to users moving to high speed access
services in areas where the company does not yet offer broadband
access. He also factored in the proliferation of free Internet
service providers and computer makers who offer discounts with the
purchase of a particular ISP.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to get their churn down from where it
is now,'' said Sadler. ``The critical factor is: Can they get churn
under 4 percent. Going over 5 (percent) is going in the wrong
direction Hopefully, that's the high.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary said he was confident EarthLink could meet its
projections of 4.5 million subscribers and $1 billion in revenue by
the end of 2000 without offering free Internet access. He did not
think it would be necessary to forge other deals with computer
makers, other than an existing deal with Apple. He also said
EarthLink will have wireless products available on the Sprint PCS
wireless service sometime during the second quarter of this year.
(Sprint owns a 14 percent share in EarthLink.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Merger issues and the difficulty deploying high speed
telephone access were EarthLink's biggest challenges,'' Sadler
said. ``As you are switching systems over, systems failures are
part of that. You're shifting vendors and locations and you are
alienating people who are trying to call in at that time. You never
know how those are going to get resolved. They not only had to
integrate these (EarthLink and MindSpring) but MindSpring was
wrapping up its own mergers of their own with SpryNet and Netcom.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink's sales and marketing costs more than tripled to about
$119 million from $31.1 million in the same period a year earlier.

AMAZON.COM PROVIDES NEW CLOUT FOR WINESHOPPER.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB NORBERG

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Wineshopper.com, a Napa- and San
Francisco-based Internet wine sales site, has announced an
agreement with Amazon.com that gives Wineshopper significant
financial backing plus access to the online retailing giant's
marketing clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a $30 million investment and we get access to their
customers, potentially through direct e-mail marketing campaigns or
packaging of printed material in their shipments to customers,''
said Wineshopper spokeswoman Suzanne Gannon. ``It definitely gives
us a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   What Wineshopper.com isn't getting, at least initially, is a
direct link to its site on Amazon.com's Internet site, which has 17
million customers, although Amazon spokeswoman Kristin Schaefer
said that could happen in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a straight investment for us and we are not contemplating
adding a tab at this time,'' Schaefer said. ``We will be working
with them as they roll out nationally, but we don't have any
specific plans at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced Tuesday in San Francisco, although
the investment _ $30 million from Amazon.com and $16 million from
venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers _ was made
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon said they wanted to wait until Wineshopper.com, which has
been plagued during the past year with technology glitches, was
finally able to launch. The site quietly went live Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the investment and access to Amazon's
marketing expertise alone are significant benefits, but because
there is no specific vehicle to drive Internet traffic to the
Wineshopper site, it doesn't make Wineshopper a contestant yet in
the crowded field of Internet wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com of Napa is by far the biggest online wine retailer,
with $96 million in backing and the advantage of the ``wine.com''
domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine.com is the largest by a factor of 100,'' said Ken Orton,
chairman of the board of Wine.com, which ships wine to 42 states.
``Wineshopper is the only perceived competition, and they are only
in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the market is segmented by Drinks.com, WineBins.com,
aficion.com, ambrosiawine.com, eVineyard, eWine.com and
WineAccess.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wine are expected to be one of the hottest markets on
the Internet, accounting for 5 percent to 10 percent of all retail
wine sales by 2005, according to a report released in March by
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wine sales via the Internet were less than $100 million in 1998,
but should reach to between $1.4 billion and $2.9 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, online book sales will be 17 percent of all
retail book sales, and toy purchases will be 14 percent of retail
toy sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine is unusually well suited for online sales,'' said Salomon
Smith Barney analyst Mark Swartzberg. ``It has the lack of touch
element, like books and toys. And the Internet resolves several
problems, such as the intimidation consumers feel when selecting a
bottle and the information intensity of selecting a bottle of
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineshopper.com is unusual because it doesn't ship wines itself,
but funnels requests from consumers to the producers and retailers
in the consumer's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com, in contrast, ships directly from its Napa warehouse,
which its officials say assures quality customer service, while
Wineshopper leaves its customer service up to the individual
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wineshopper.com touts its links to other Internet wine sites,
including The WineSpectator, with its database of 77,000 wine
tastings, and Winetoday.com, with its database of 6,000 wines, but
plans to taste 8,000 wines a year by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Winetoday.com is part of New York Times Digital, a division of
The New York Times Co. New York Times Digital has a minority stake
in Wineshopper.com.

STOLEN CHINESE RELIC A SHOWPIECE IN JAPAN?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In late December a leading scholar of ancient Buddhist
sculpture, Yang Hong, received a mysterious envelope here in the
mail. Inside was the lavish catalog of the Miho Museum, a major new
antiquities museum near Kyoto, Japan, that was designed by I.M. Pei
and was opened in 1997 by a wealthy religious sect.
</P>
<P>
   A slip of paper marked the page bearing a photograph of one of
the museum's masterpieces: an elegant 47{-inch stone carving from
China of a Buddhist figure known as a bodhisattva, with a large
halo and singular features including an extremely rare cicada
figure on the crown. Scrawled on the bookmark were the words
``National treasure!''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the envelope was a copy of a 1983 article from the
Chinese journal Cultural Relics describing, with photographs, a
group of newly excavated stone carvings from Boxing county in
Shandong Province. The carvings were early fruits of a major new
discovery of ethereal Buddhist sculptures from a sixth-century
dynasty in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Marked in that article were a photograph and description of a
statue that appeared to be identical to the Miho's showpiece _ the
same halo, the same cicada, the same measurements, the same stone
and exactly the same pattern of damages to the arms and body.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous letter tipped off Chinese archaeologists to what
they view as a clear-cut example of a rampant global problem: the
theft of cultural relics that are then given a false provenance and
sold to private collectors and museums at prices ranging into the
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest number of such thefts occur in China, which is
filled with unexplored tombs and other archaeological remains as
well as poorly guarded temples and museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see so many Chinese relics appearing overseas, and they've
virtually all been stolen and spirited out,'' said Yu Weichao,
retired director of the National Museum of Chinese History. ``As
one who has worked in archaeology for a lifetime, I feel
heartbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue described in that 1983 journal, it turned out, was
stolen from Boxing county offices on the night of July 4, 1994, in
an unsolved case.
</P>
<P>
   The Miho purchased its apparently identical statue from a major
London dealer in October 1995 for an undisclosed sum. The dealer,
J.E. Eskenazi of Eskenazi Ltd., said in a faxed reply to questions
that he had purchased the sculpture from ``a long established and
reputable gallery in London'' but declined to name the gallery or
provide evidence of the item's prior history.
</P>
<P>
   The Miho Museum says it has not yet been proved that the two
statues are one and the same, though it is now taking steps to find
out. Regardless, it says, it bought the object ``in good faith''
and will not necessarily return it.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese experts in Beijing and in Boxing county say that based
on the clear photographs and data in the Miho catalog, they are
certain that the Miho figure is the one stolen in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, who received the initial tip, is a senior fellow of the
Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Social Sciences. ``It's
definitely the same statue,'' he said. ``It's not just the cicada,
but also the damage and cracks on the statue, and all the other
identical features.''
</P>
<P>
   Shu Lichuan, director of the Boxing County Relics Bureau, said:
``We had the statue here for so long, up to 1994 when it was
stolen, and so we knew it very well. As soon as we saw the museum
photo we were quite sure that it's the same statue.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an illustration of the legal and bureaucratic obstacles
to fighting such thefts, Chinese agencies have not yet taken
official action to seek the statue's return. If they do, they could
be hamstrung by Japan's not having signed the 1970 UNESCO
convention requiring member countries to return relics proved to be
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese experts do not accuse the dealer or the museum of
knowingly purchasing stolen goods. But they lament a system in
which traders and buyers all too readily accept implausible claims
about treasures that seem to appear out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of illicit trafficking has never been greater,
according to the International Council of Museums, an organization
based in Paris that has tried to fight the problem with a code of
ethics for its 15,000 member institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows certain things are stolen, or should know it,
and yet these things still appear on the market,'' said Manus
Brinkman, secretary general of the council, in an interview. ``This
involves famous dealers and art houses, not just shady operators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not only from China,'' Brinkman added. ``It's
Cambodia and Thailand, Peru and Bolivia, Nigeria and Eastern
Europe, where icons are disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskenazi, the London dealer, countered that it was usually
impossible to thoroughly check the histories of Chinese antiquities
offered for sale. ``Many millions of objects have been exported
from China over hundreds of years,'' he said. ``Rarely do they come
with a provenance going back to their origin.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending their 1995 deal, Eskenazi and the Japanese museum
both said that Chinese officials never made an international report
of the statue's theft, which might have alerted them to a problem.
Boxing county officials say they reported the theft to their
provincial office in 1994, and it is unclear today to what level
the report was relayed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Eskenazi also said that the sculpture had been featured in a
widely distributed 1995 sales catalog seen by many Chinese experts
and officials and that no one raised any questions then.

</P>
<P>
   A common problem in detecting questionable sales is that many
objects are taken abroad without ever being recorded by experts, in
well-organized operations that may involve the bribery of local or
higher-level officials. In China, farmers, construction workers and
criminal gangs unearth thousands of relics, large and small, each
year and quickly sell them to smugglers. In some cases thieves hack
panels off temple walls or steal items from poorly guarded museums
or storerooms, at times with the complicity of the keepers.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen artifacts are often smuggled to Hong Kong, officials
say, where they are given fake histories. Eventually they are sold,
often by top-flight dealers, galleries and auction houses in
Europe, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The world's museums have generally set stricter standards for
acquisitions over the last decade, experts say, so that today
private collectors provide the major market for smuggled relics.
Pressure on the museums has grown as a result of bad publicity, the
1970 Unesco convention and the museum council's own code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The Miho Museum has not joined the International Council of
Museums, but its curator says that the museum tries to avoid
trouble by purchasing from reputable dealers. ``If we buy it
indirectly, we have a sort of safe feeling,'' said Hiroaki
Katayama, chief curator of the Miho.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is now studying the Unesco convention with an eye to
possible signing, said Lyndel Prott, the Unesco official in charge
of implementing the convention. If it does join, the rules would
not apply to earlier imports.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, the subscribing countries, which include
China, the United States and most other Western nations, agree that
when a theft is proved, the object must be returned, in some cases
with compensation to unknowing buyers. Negotiations are supposed to
occur through official diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the system works: on March 28 at Christie's auction
house in New York, American customs officials seized a marble wall
panel that had been chiseled off a 10th-century tomb in China in
1994. But often it is impossible to prove the source of suspicious
items.
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple definition of a legal or ethical acquisition
since many relics held in the West, including treasures in major
museums, were taken abroad in an earlier freewheeling era.
</P>
<P>
   The Unesco convention has provided a rough benchmark, Prott
said: if an object was first seen outside its country after 1970,
then ``a respectable museum should not buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing Shandong Buddhist figure is an exceptional case
because it had been photographed and described in a journal. Even
so, China may have to rely more on moral pressure than on legal
action to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Katayama, the Miho's curator, said in an interview that even if
it is proved that the sculpture was the one stolen in 1994, the
museum might not return it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make every effort to check the origin of works in our
collection,'' he said. ``If a problem arises we deal with it in the
context of international law, and our lawyer says that with regard
to this statue, we don't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we purchased it in good faith, it is our asset and we
cannot return it for free,'' he added, implying that with
compensation, a return might be possible. ``Of course we need to
keep friendship with China, so we are willing to consult and
negotiate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   China has tried to fight relics smuggling and has made numerous
arrests of pillagers, but officials acknowledge that they are
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the mid-1980s, criminal activities to steal relics
stored in museums or from tombs have been incessant and growing
worse,'' Zhang Wenbin, the director of the State Cultural Relics
Bureau in Beijing, said in legislative testimony on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smuggling of relics is rampant,'' Zhang said. ``These problems
are related to the lax enforcement and inadequacies of relics
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the missing Shandong sculpture, confusion seems
to reign in the official system for combating theft.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state relics bureau, Wang Limei, said in
an interview, ``This matter is being directly handled by the
Shandong Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau.'' But Zhang Congjun,
deputy director of the Shandong relics bureau, said: ``We have had
no contact with the Miho Museum, and this is a matter for the state
bureau to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Miho Museum officials have bypassed China's responsible national
and provincial agencies and visited Boxing county directly to
discuss the matter with local cultural and political officials in
the poor and isolated region.
</P>
<P>
   Some archaeologists and officials in Beijing question whether
local officials should negotiate the fate of an important relic
governed by national law.
</P>
<P>
   Katayama, the Miho curator, quietly traveled with colleagues and
a Swiss consultant to Boxing county in February and met mainly, he
said, with Li Shaonan, the county relics officer who originally
described the statue in that 1983 article.
</P>
<P>
   Katayama said that the museum had invited Li and five others,
including Shu, the county relics director, as well as a county
political leader, to visit the Miho in late May at the museum's
expense to examine the statue and discuss future steps. The
officials are now applying for passports.  &QL;

&HT;     COURT SAYS SIX-YEAR-OLD ELIAN HAS LEGAL STANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     A News Analsysi

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a federal appeals court order keeping Elian
Gonzalez in the United States, a key question raised by the court
is whether the six-year-old boy can apply for political asylum
against the wishes of his father.
</P>
<P>
   According to Charles Keely, an immigration law expert at
Georgetown University, Elian and his Miami relatives likely will
lose that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds odd to me that a six-year-old would be presumed
capable of making a life-altering decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keely said that allowing Elian to apply for asylum would be
breaking a fundamental tenet of U.S. law, which is that minors
cannot speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where you draw the line,'' he said. ``If not at
six years old, then what about five years old, or maybe four years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta upheld a restraining order keeping Elian in
the country. The appellate court said the U.S. government should
have taken the boy's wishes into account in determining whether he
should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-page ruling bars anyone from attempting to remove Elian
from the United States until all court proceedings have been
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not specifically forbid the INS from taking
custody and it did not address government efforts to reunite Elian
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has been waiting in
Washington since April 6. The father says he wants to take his son
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was one of three survivors of a shipwreck in which his
mother, her boyfriend and nine others drowned when their boat sank
as they were fleeing Cuba for the United States last November.
</P>
<P>
   The three appeals judges expressed support for efforts by
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, to win an asylum
hearing and questioned the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the record, plaintiff _ although a young child _
has expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba,'' the judges
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes,'' the ruling said. ``It
is not clear that the INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the
only proper representative, considered all of the relevant factors
_ particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   In a home video released to the public last week, Elian told his
father he does not want to return to Cuba. Elian's Miami relatives
say the boy wasn't coached about what to say and that the tape
proves he wants to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Keely said that the tape would mean ``very little'' in any
U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless someone can show why Juan Miguel shouldn't speak for
the child, the idea that courts should take a 6-year-old boy's
wishes over his father's is ludicrous,'' he said. ``What if a child
decides he doesn't want to go to school or eat anything but candy,
would our society tell his parents to let him? Of course, not.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which the government could appeal to the full
circuit court, is considered a critical step in the international
custody dispute that has lasted for nearly five months. The judges
had been asked by the government to overrule an emergency order
issued last week that delayed government efforts to bring Elian to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the Justice Department or
the INS.

<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, in Oklahoma City to commemorate the
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, was unavailable
for comment. But at her weekly news conference Wednesday morning,
Reno reiterated that she would be willing to use force to reunited
Elian with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will utilize all law enforcement options if appropriate
under the 11th Circuit order,'' Reno told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also brushed off criticism of her handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid violence,
if the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid that little boy
being hurt or being snatched away in a way that can scar him
further, I plead guilty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general rejected reports that the 1993 attack on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in which 78 members
of the Branch Davidian sect died, has caused her to hesitate on
taking action in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Waco, you had people who had not only defied the law but
killed people in the process,'' she said. ``There's a lot of
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she declined to comment on how she plans to end the
department's standoff with Elian's Miami relatives, Reno emphasized
that she had not ``lost her way,'' as some critics have charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I'm going,'' she said.

ITALIAN PREMIER QUITS AFTER ELECTION SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Closing down Italy's 57th government since World War II,
Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema resigned Wednesday, leaving his
battered center-left coalition to look for someone else to govern
until parliamentary elections a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   But Silvio Berlusconi, the center-right opposition leader who
was the big winner in the regional elections on Sunday, insisted
that President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi dissolve parliament right away
and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   So Italians are left puzzling whether a center-left successor to
D'Alema can be found or whether they will head back to the polls
this spring, for the fourth parliamentary elections since 1992.
Ciampi also has the option of appointing a caretaker government,
even if the divided center-left majority can agree on a candidate,
or calling a snap election.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi said he would begin consulting party leaders on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a final speech to the Senate Wednesday, D'Alema admitted some
failings that had led to his coalition's humiliating defeat. But he
urged his colleagues not to allow early elections that would
jettison a referendum on May 21 that he insists would bring greater
stability to the hybrid _ and volatile _ electoral system. D'Alema
wants to introduce a two-bloc system and eliminate proportional
representation, which accounts for 25 percent of the seats in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be paradoxical to go to a vote with an election
system that all political forces regard as inadequate to guarantee
government stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, many small parties in his own coalition oppose
changes in electoral laws that could wipe them out of parliament.
Berlusconi and some center-right allies also oppose the change.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema submitted his resignation to Ciampi on Monday, but was
told to consult parliament. Wednesday, he listened as senators
debated his rocky tenure and then returned to Ciampi's office and
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, his fate seemed obvious enough for his coalition
partners to begin weighing the chances of other leaders. Among the
names under hurried review was that of Treasury Minister Giuliano
Amato, a socialist who was prime minister for just under a year in
1992 and who is respected for his economic expertise.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who turns 51 on Thursday, took office 18 months ago in
a parliamentary maneuver after his predecessor, Romano Prodi, had
lost a confidence vote by one vote. D'Alema was the first former
communist prime minister in Western Europe. But he steered a
centrist course, supporting the NATO conflict in Kosovo and passing
budgets aimed at keeping the Italian economy within the confines of
the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But his government majority was slim at the outset, and after
narrowly surviving a no-confidence vote in December, it shrank even
further. He was unable to push through welfare and pension reforms,
but alienated unions by trying. He had only moderate success
tackling the unemployment rate, which remains above 20 percent in
southern Italy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His government's lack of popular support was underlined in the
regional elections, when the center-right coalition won eight of 15
contests for regional presidents, who are roughly akin to U.S.
governors, including in Lazio, the region of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, 63, who was prime minister for less than a year in
1994, is a business and media baron. In the regional elections, his
party, Forza Italia, joined forces with the Northern League, which
rose in the late '80s as a separatist movement and still favors
great autonomy for the prosperous North. It is also
anti-immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the center-right coalition did better than expected,
hammering on issues like unemployment, crime and immigration. But
Berlusconi also made an issue of D'Alema's communist roots,
adopting ``freedom'' as his slogan and accusing the government of
undemocratic methods.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, even some staunch capitalists gave the
departing D'Alema good marks. ``He quit with a lot of style,''
Gianni Agnelli, a life senator and the honorary chairman of Fiat,
said after D'Alema's speech. ``As they used to say in the
regiments, it doesn't matter if you get off a horse or fall off of
it, the important thing is to do it with style.''

&HT;     MILLION MOM MARCH IN WASHINGTON GETS LOCAL SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Local officials here said Wednesday they support
efforts by mothers across the country to march for gun control
legislation in the nation's capital on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference march promoters said they are seeking
passage of ``common-sense gun legislation,'' including measures to
prevent gun sales to criminals and make it easier to track guns
that are used to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams said, ``We don't need
another Columbine to know that it's time for licensing and
registration of handguns for background checks (and) strong
enforcement of our laws.'' He was referring to the shooting spree a
year ago at Columbine High School near Denver in which two
teenagers killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and others insisted that Congress should approve gun
legislation even though some localities have already enacted strict
statutes. He noted that Washington, D.C. has banned the sale of
handguns within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters of the so-called Million Mom March said
Congress favors the National Rifle Association over the safety of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland Democratic congressman who
heads Handgun Control Inc., a pro-gun-control group, said that
``because there is a very powerful gun lobby in this country,
nothing is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that on May 14, Mother's Day, ``tens of thousands of
Americans, led by our moms, will be here on the (National) Mall
calling for action.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited statistics showing 12 children die each day from gun
violence and that 4,000 children have been killed by guns in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Albert Wynn, D-Md., said that ``unfortunately, the
Republican leadership hasn't listened to (gun control supporters).
Well I think on the 14th maybe they'll listen to the moms,'' he
said. ``We want sane, common-sense gun control laws now.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington, D.C.'s
nonvoting House member, noted that the 17 children killed in the
city so far this year were shot by people with handguns purchased
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has not met its national obligation to prevent
gun-running even into cities that have made handguns illegal within
their borders as we have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Local mothers who have lost children to gun violence, expressed
sorrow at their losses and anger at what they said are lax gun
control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Price, the Maryland coordinator of the march, vowed that
``Congress on May 14th will be forced to do something about this
national crisis that we are in or we, the mothers of this country,
will do something about Congress in November.'' Price's 13-year-old
son was accidentally shot and killed in 1998 by a nine-year-old
boy.

&HT;     COURT SAYS SIX-YEAR-OLD ELIAN HAS LEGAL STANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     A News Analsysi  
 &HT;     (EDS: INSERTS new grafs 17-18 with Reno comment)

 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a federal appeals court order keeping Elian
Gonzalez in the United States, a key question raised by the court
is whether the six-year-old boy can apply for political asylum
against the wishes of his father.
</P>
<P>
   According to Charles Keely, an immigration law expert at
Georgetown University, Elian and his Miami relatives likely will
lose that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds odd to me that a six-year-old would be presumed
capable of making a life-altering decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keely said that allowing Elian to apply for asylum would be
breaking a fundamental tenet of U.S. law, which is that minors
cannot speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where you draw the line,'' he said. ``If not at
six years old, then what about five years old, or maybe four years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta upheld a restraining order keeping Elian in
the country. The appellate court said the U.S. government should
have taken the boy's wishes into account in determining whether he
should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-page ruling bars anyone from attempting to remove Elian
from the United States until all court proceedings have been
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not specifically forbid the INS from taking
custody and it did not address government efforts to reunite Elian
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has been waiting in
Washington since April 6. The father says he wants to take his son
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was one of three survivors of a shipwreck in which his
mother, her boyfriend and nine others drowned when their boat sank
as they were fleeing Cuba for the United States last November.
</P>
<P>
   The three appeals judges expressed support for efforts by
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, to win an asylum
hearing and questioned the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the record, plaintiff _ although a young child _
has expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba,'' the judges
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes,'' the ruling said. ``It
is not clear that the INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the
only proper representative, considered all of the relevant factors
_ particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   In a home video released to the public last week, Elian told his
father he does not want to return to Cuba. Elian's Miami relatives
say the boy wasn't coached about what to say and that the tape
proves he wants to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Keely said that the tape would mean ``very little'' in any
U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless someone can show why Juan Miguel shouldn't speak for
the child, the idea that courts should take a 6-year-old boy's
wishes over his father's is ludicrous,'' he said. ``What if a child
decides he doesn't want to go to school or eat anything but candy,
would our society tell his parents to let him? Of course, not.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which the government could appeal to the full
circuit court, is considered a critical step in the international
custody dispute that has lasted for nearly five months. The judges
had been asked by the government to overrule an emergency order
issued last week that delayed government efforts to bring Elian to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, in Oklahoma City to commemorate the
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, promised to abide
by the appeals court's ruling, but pointed out that the decision
made no mention of where Elian should live with during his time in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not say the boy cannot be reunited with his father
while in the country,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference Wednesday morning, Reno reiterated
that she would be willing to use force to reunited Elian with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will utilize all law enforcement options if appropriate
under the 11th Circuit order,'' Reno told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also brushed off criticism of her handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid violence,
if the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid that little boy
being hurt or being snatched away in a way that can scar him
further, I plead guilty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general rejected reports that the 1993 attack on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in which 78 members
of the Branch Davidian sect died, has caused her to hesitate on
taking action in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Waco, you had people who had not only defied the law but
killed people in the process,'' she said. ``There's a lot of
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she declined to comment on how she plans to end the
department's standoff with Elian's Miami relatives, Reno emphasized
that she had not ``lost her way,'' as some critics have charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I'm going,'' she said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where else in town can you find a nice set of
disembodied hands or a bridge chair that snaps shut to the music
from ``Jaws''? Where else do kites fly without wind or hand carts
turn into vehicles for inventive choreography?
</P>
<P>
   Well, once again the answer is the New Victory Theater, where a
talented troupe called ``Do Jump!'' is performing in a show of the
same name for a dozen more performances through April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Although the New Victory is dedicated to entertainment for
children, ``Do Jump!,'' with a succession of highly creative
vignettes that range from tap dancing to a power lunch by four
acrobatic women who mean business to clever audience participation
in performance and song, offers satisfying entertainment for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do Jump!,'' subtitled ``Extremely Physical Theater'' and
conceived and directed by Robin Lane, arrives from Portland, Ore.,
as a fusion of mischievous comedy, circus, dance and movement
enhanced by atmospheric lighting and buoyed by the wide spectrum of
propulsive music performed by the versatile four-member,
multi-instrument ``Do Jump!'' band.
</P>
<P>
   Visually and aurally this show adds up to yet another relaxing
treat, even if the final vignette, ``Doors,'' involving the entire
company and a two-level set of perverse wooden doors, might profit
from shortening.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that ``Do Jump!'' furnishes fun in
profusion. Laughter and cheers greet ``Walk Person,'' in which
instructions from headsets turn adults and children chosen from the
audience into a performing ensemble. Awed oohs respond to the
ethereal ``Fly,'' in which David Brittain sends his kites soaring
and swooping over stage and audience; and genuine ah's, ha's and
oh's are the audience's contribution to ``Ah Ha,'' a sing-along
determined by the constantly changing positions (including
upside-down) of two performers wearing shirts emblazoned with the
letters A, H and O.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked are the performers on rings and trapeze,
whose graceful postures are enhanced by the lighting of Tad Shannon
and the music created and performed by Mike Van Liew, Courtney Von
Drehle and Chris Monroe who, with Joan Szymko, constitute the band.
</P>
<P>
   As for the most praiseworthy ``Do Jump!'' troupe, its members
include Wendy Cohen, Heather Pearl, Daniela Steiner, Aaron
Wheeler-Kay, Kelli Wilson and Robin Woolman.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to all, ``Do Jump!'' keeps the New Victory jumping.

 &HT;    Columbine tragedy etched in students' memory a year later
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ On the porch of a house on a broad street
that winds through steep hills south of Columbine High School,
Linda Gallegos tries to explain what was unthinkable one year ago
today: the killings that brought her neighborhood to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never dreamed we would have to deal with something so
monumental in our lives,'' said Gallegos, 53, mother of four
children who attended Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the area, subtle reminders of the tragedy abound.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher leads a group of students in from recess at nearby
Leawood Elementary School, where disbelieving parents and family
members of the 14 students and one teacher who died at Columbine
gathered in the gym a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the small children walk hand-in-hand in a long
snaking line. The teacher clutches a walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school, students are governed by a ``zero tolerance''
discipline policy. Trenchcoats are banned and teasing is strictly
controlled, punishable by suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the rows of homes clustered at the base of the
foothills are re-evaluating their relationships with their
children. They are tired of answering questions of the reporters
who have flocked to the area for the better part of a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the clusters of strip malls that surround the sprawling high
school, students discuss algebra over coffee at lunch. A group of
laughing girls with backpacks at their feet talk about boys.
</P>
<P>
   Three junior boys mull over the unfolding impact of the
shootings. They describe a transformation from what until a year
ago was a typical American high school experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents, right now, still want me to go somewhere else,''
said Dan Yager, 16. ``I just want to stay with it and beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager, who was eating in the school cafeteria when Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold walked in shooting, said he never saw the gunmen.
He simply hit the floor when he heard gunshots and then quickly got
up and ran out.
</P>
<P>
   It took about three months for his fear of loud noises to
subside, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Stephens, 17, is angry with Harris and Klebold. He says the
outcasts who wore dark trenchcoats and chalky white face makeup to
school should have expected to be ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   But he holds a glimmer of understanding about why they killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised at all, those kids got bitched at day in
and day out,'' Stephens said. ``If you're different like that, if
you're going to be like that, you have to expect that, and they
didn't expect it. It's high school, it's going to happen, you've
got to expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Zimmerman, 17, said many of the students who a year ago
didn't fit into the cliques at Columbine have adapted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of those kids that used to hang out with them
last year changed a lot this year,'' Zimmerman said. ``They moved
or cleaned up their act. They quit wearing all of the black.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything that happened changes the way people
treat each other,'' he said. ``I haven't experienced any change.
They're still the groups, there's still the cliques.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Columbine are asking more questions, all three
boys said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you pep talks before you leave on weekends,''
Stephens said. ``They want to know where you are, where you're
going, what kind of friends are you hanging out with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they acknowledge the prospect of easily hiding things
from their own parents, all three boys place an amount of blame on
the parents of the two killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of the parent to teach their kid
morals, like not to kill people,'' Yager said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings should wake up a community that must be more
accepting of those who are different, Gallegos said. After all, she
said, the young killers didn't grow up in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't just happen to the children, it happened to all of
us,'' Gallegos said. ``I think it's an eye-opener. Those young men
were victims _ in a sense _ of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people have moved out of the quiet neighborhoods that wrap
around the high school, said Bob Schott, a 49-year-old computer
programmer whose daughter spent nearly four hours trapped in the
Columbine choir director's office on the day of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular day was the longest day of my life,'' said
Schott, who was a soccer coach to Steven Curnow, one of the
students who was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Some good has come from the shootings, Schott said. His company
donated funds to the victim's families and neighborhood residents
banded together to shovel snow and to do chores for the family of
Patrick Ireland, a neighbor who was severely injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are more willing to talk to students about personal
issues unrelated to school work, several students said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliques at Columbine have more respect for each other in the
aftermath of the shootings, said Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the kids that aren't popular, they don't get made fun of
as much as they would if nothing happened,'' Stephens said. ``Kids
finally understand what could happen as a result if you do say
something bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the rampage, the children of Columbine are
beginning to understand how Harris and Klebold changed them. In
between the football games and lunch periods and walks home
dragging books linger thoughts that are strikingly unrelated to
normal high school experiences.
</P>
<P>
   They are teen-agers who have been exposed early to the prospect
of their own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will affect them forever,'' Yager said, of his
classmates at Columbine. ``It just depends on the person, whether
they want to let it set them back or not. Some people take it, you
know, and some just don't do too well.''

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ They have seen the enemy creep into the
settled, earth-toned neighborhoods of this city _ the boxy
transplants from the suburban netherland. Houses that turn their
backs to the street. Houses that embrace a nesting pair of
monster-size sport utility vehicles and little else. Houses that
give no idea where the front door might be.
</P>
<P>
   Snout houses, they call them, all garage and muscled front
facades. And for the last eight months, Portland has made the snout
house illegal, going to a frontier of design dictate where no other
big American city has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still build an ugly house in Portland,'' said Charlie
Hales, the city commissioner who led the effort to ban houses that
do not fit into this city's neighborhood fabric. ``But now you just
have to work at it a lot harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Portland has been like Martha Stewart at the keg
party of American cities. While other cities (Portlanders mention
Houston with particular horror) have proudly resisted even
elemental zoning, Portland has decreed a perpetual self-improvement
binge.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years ago, in what seemed a radical step against
sprawl, the Portland metropolitan area drew a line over which the
city could not spill. The city ripped up a freeway near downtown
and replaced it with a grassy, riverfront park: pedestrians and
bicycles only, please! Then tracks were laid for a light-rail
system, Max, which lets Portland claim a certain moral high ground
in transportation circles, even if it has not made traffic on the
freeways move more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Literary quotations are embedded in the streets downtown, where
the code protects views of Mount Hood and the Willamette River and
entire blocks of historic neighborhoods, and it prohibits blank
walls or ``uninviting'' entrances at the ground floor of buildings.
All of this has allowed urban planners from this place, known as
the Rose City, to dine out around the country, extolling ``the
Portland Story.''
</P>
<P>
   And now comes the next front in this city's war against the
nation's urban icons _ the big-chested detached house with two-car
garage. Last September, against the protests of builders who said
that the city government had no right to enforce home designs, the
Portland City Council voted, in effect, to outlaw the ``snout
house'' _ unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   In this ever-quirky city of just under half a million people,
the term ``snout house'' has since been shunned as offensive to
people who live in snout houses. But the offending structure has
been clearly defined in the city code: the garage cannot dominate
the front of the house or protrude; the main entrance has to be
close to the street and clearly identifiable from the sidewalk; and
the side of the house that faces the street must have a certain
minimum of window and door space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we want a house to pass the `trick or treat
test,''' Hales said. ``So when kids come around to trick or treat,
they actually get a sense that somebody lives in the house, and
they can find the door. Imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some home builders are infuriated by this kind of talk.
Structural shear requirements and universal electrical standards
are one thing. But talking about a house that has to make ``more
connection to the public realm,'' as the city planners have done,
is another thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really wild stuff,'' said Kelly Ross, the government
affairs director of the Homebuilders Association of Metropolitan
Portland. His group sponsors ``Street of Dreams,'' a show where
builders show off their most pneumatic homes. ``Last year,
virtually every house featured would have been illegal under the
new design code,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that disparity could have more to do with the gulf between
home builders and Portland's city planners. Nationwide, a backlash
has been under way for some time against certain suburban house
designs. Attempts to reign in ``McMansions'' and monster-box homes
have resulted in height and size restrictions in parts of
California and Colorado, among other states.
</P>
<P>
   The darling of so-called New Urbanist house styles is a retro
dwelling with porch and hidden garage, bay windows and gabled
roofs, not unlike the average house that Walt Disney Co. brought
forth from focus groups and produced in Celebration, its model town
in Florida. Northwest Landing, a New Urbanist community 40 miles
south of Seattle, is also a pedestrian-friendly clutter of houses
that would be welcome in any vacant lot in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Private, gated communities, which were among the fastest-growing
residential neighborhoods in the 1990's, have long regulated house
color, entrance size and the placement of a driveway basketball
hoop, among other things. But no big city has gone so far as
Portland, which seems to delight in attacking the conventional
wisdom of developers and home builders. The builders feel offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're building these tract houses that are ugly
as sin,'' said Randy Voeller, a draftsman for Mascord Design of
Portland. The company finds that nearly 35 percent of its home
plans do not meet the new requirements. ``Nobody wants to build an
ugly house. But we don't like the city trying to shove these base
designs down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   The home builders say the city is trying to turn back the clock,
to a time when Mom stayed home, and Dad took the streetcar to work.
``The city of Portland should recognize the reality of our
culture,'' Ross said. ``The norm in today's households is two
vehicles, and the vehicles are getting larger. It makes no sense to
impose a standard that runs counter to these facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders and others have criticized the design regulations as a
serious erosion of property rights. They filed an appeal with the
state. But that challenge was rejected. Nationwide, legal assaults
have been turned back by the courts, which have continued to give
municipalities the right to zone and regulate, even for esthetics,
within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   The builders are particularly angry at the city commissioner,
Hales. For a decade, he was the lobbyist for the home builders.
Now, as the person leading the charge that outlawed some of their
most popular home plans, he has become a pariah among his former
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a traitor,'' said Jeff Fish, a leading builder. ``There's
no other way to put it. And the city of Portland, they've become
socialists.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fish has built hundreds of snout houses. On his wall is a big
picture of a new pink house, a flaring double-nostriled garage out
front for oversize sport utility vehicles. He displays one of his
more popular home designs: a simple, 1,400-square-foot house,
complete with puffed-up garage and obscured entrance, which is
labeled atop the architectural drawing, ``Snout house.'' It sells
for about $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a class of people who want that double-car garage,'' he
said. ``As an American citizen, I have the right to build whatever
I want to sell to that class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The design restrictions mean that the average new home will
cost, Fish estimates, about $17,000 more to build. The city, citing
a study done before last year's vote, says the cost on new homes is
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that builders may have lost the war, at least in
Portland, even Fish will no longer defend the snout house. He shows
a design with decidedly New Urbanist touches. You want a front
porch, he can give you a front porch. You want a hidden garage, he
will hide it. You want bay windows, bada bing.
</P>
<P>
   The new design restriction rose from neighborhood complaints
about suburban-style houses invading the city. A city survey found
that nearly 70 percent of new homes built were snout houses. These
houses were deemed unfriendly, in some cases unsafe, because they
turned eyes away from the street, and a general affront to
Portland's civic ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody in the city government ever came right out and
said so, the intent of the new regulations was also to keep a
certain look (read: ugly and suburban) from coming to Portland. As
one architect, Martha Peck Andrews, said in a public hearing last
year, the city ``has suffered through some pretty schlocky and
insensitive residential design in the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But one person's schlocky and insensitive is another person's
castle. And who is to say that the retro design the code encourages
will not look schlocky and out of place in 30 years. ``You wonder
how different neighborhoods would look if design standards had been
in place in the 50's and 60's, when ranch-style architecture was
the prevailing style,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   The city considered regulating the pitch of roofs and the style
of sidings. But after some council member warned about getting into
uncharted waters, the city settled on regulations that specify a
garage can be no wider than 50 percent of a house front and that a
front door must be recessed no more than eight feet behind the
front wall. The code gave incentives for porches, balconies and
living space above a garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with that house,'' said Dr. Mark Bello,
a Portland city planner, as he pointed to a pre-World War II
Craftsman-style house, without garage. ``As a pedestrian, you feel
comfortable with that. It's more welcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a neighboring house, remodeled in suburban snout
mode. ``That house cuts you off,'' he said. ``It turns its back to
the street. It's not necessarily ugly, but it has no connection to
the public realm. It's all about the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most available residential lots inside the city are
smaller than older lots, it will be hard to build a new house with
a two-car garage. And city officials do not deny that this is one
intent of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anti-automobile so much as we are pro-pedestrian,''
Bello said. ``We are trying to avoid the downward spiral of urban
neighborhoods becoming unsuccessful suburban neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Hales denies that the city is trying to legislate taste. ``We're
trying to reinforce the great neighborhood character that already
exists in Portland,'' he said. ``I mean, who is really practicing
social engineering here? The people who design communities where
you can't do anything but drive? Or the people who give you a
choice of getting away from your car?''
</P>
<P>
   The city has managed to scare away a certain kind of home
builder. Fish, a Portland native, who has built more than 500
houses in the city, now sports a bumper sticker on his car with the
slogan: ``Friends don't let friends build in Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is considering moving to Las Vegas, America's fastest
growing city. ``They have almost no restrictions down there,'' he
said, with uncontained glee.

A SITCOM SAVANT BRANCHES OUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Ohio)   By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People don't get much more alone in the world than Novalee
Nation in the early scenes of ``Where the Heart Is.'' She's 17,
very pregnant and even barefoot _ since her shoes fell through a
huge hole in the car floor somewhere between Tennessee and
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive from her trailer-park home to a new life in
California, she makes the mistake of asking her boyfriend to stop
at a Wal-Mart so she can go to the bathroom. When she returns to
the parking lot, he and the car are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Novalee (Natalie Portman, looking radiant but very un-Queen
Amidala-like) does the only thing she can think of, since she
doesn't know a soul in Sequoyah, Okla. She goes back into the
store, and when it closes for the night (while she's in the ladies'
room) she just stays.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the camping, patio furniture and exercise equipment
departments and shelves full of magazines and working alarm clocks,
she's quite comfortable for six weeks. After she goes into labor
there she's a local celebrity, and little by little she builds a
life in Sequoyah, with the usual ups and downs, weddings and
funerals, kidnappings and tornados.
</P>
<P>
   If a Hollywood studio had gone looking for the ideal director
for ``Where the Heart Is,'' which opens on Friday, it probably
would not have looked twice at Matt Williams, a bicoastal
television mogul resting on his laurels after helping create sitcom
megahits like ``Roseanne'' and ``Home Improvement,'' a man in his
late 40s who had never directed a film in his life.
</P>
<P>
   But when Wind Dancer, the production company he and two partners
run, acquired the rights to Billie Letts' down-home 1995 novel,
Williams got involved, looked around and eventually gave himself
the job. In the end, the choice made a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it more than anything else I've ever done in my
life,'' Williams says over beer and calamari at an Upper West Side
Italian restaurant near his apartment. ``Everything I've done that
I have understood from the inside out has succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does know the people of ``Where the Heart Is,'' he
contends, even though his hometown, Evansville, Ind., may seem less
like Wal-Mart country than the film's Oklahoma setting. ``Indiana
is almost like three states,'' Williams says, ``one urban, one
rural, one Southern.'' Evansville, a blue-collar town on the Ohio
River, falls into the third category; cross the river and you're in
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my childhood,'' he says. ``We rode horses and fished
in the creek for bluegill. But even in kindergarten I went, `I
don't believe there isn't more than this.' I just had no idea what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He was determined to find out, though. In fact, Williams' story,
like Novalee's, seems to prove that if you know what you want and
work hard to get it, you can create the life of your dreams. For
Novalee, that meant finally living in a home without wheels;
Williams' ambitions became a little grander.
</P>
<P>
   But they started out decidedly blue-collar. His father worked on
the assembly line for Whirlpool; his mother was a waitress. Their
son's summer jobs included laying brick and driving a dump truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I hadn't gotten a scholarship, I would have been a
bricklayer,'' he says. (There was creative influence at home,
though. On weekends his father was ``a passionate artist'' who
often discussed his paintings with his son.)
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams received two scholarships, in football and drama _
and says that he probably would not have been able to afford
college otherwise. He got a bachelor's degree in acting from the
University of Evansville and master's degrees in directing from the
University of New Orleans. His plan was to teach theater on the
college level, he says, and he thought it might be good to have
actual professional experience first.
</P>
<P>
   So in the mid-1970s, like a million young graduates before him,
he headed for New York. And like 99.9 percent of them, he did not
set the city on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Walking in and announcing, ``Hi, I'm a director and I'm 24 years
old,'' he recalls, did not get him very far. Still, he had to pay
the rent on his studio apartment in the East 80s. He had married
right after college, but his wife's salary as a Wall Street
beginner wasn't going to support them both. (She eventually became
a bond broker; they divorced after 11 years together.)
</P>
<P>
   Williams was a good-looking man (still is) _ an all-American
young-dad type, as he'd been told _ so he decided to give modeling
and television commercials a try.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked in the door for his first interview at a modeling
agency, the receptionist looked up and said: ``No. You're not our
type.'' Interview over. Luckily Williams is the kind of person who
reacts to rejection with renewed determination, rather than
crumpling and going to bed for a week. He made a grid of Manhattan
with agency addresses and walked the streets, sliding photographs
under doors.
</P>
<P>
   At home he practiced holding up products. He devised a
three-year plan, aiming for three national commercials in the first
three months. He got six in the first eight months and was soon
making more than $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   He then used the same methods to break into theater and
eventually wrote some one-act plays that were staged in the early
'80s at a small theater in Manhattan. They came to the attention of
the Emmy Award-winning sitcom director Jay Sandrich (``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show''), who asked Williams if he knew how to write for
television. Sandrich was just starting work on a new series that
would star Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is where Williams' career begins to sound like a list of
familiar credits. He worked on ``The Cosby Show,'' which was a huge
NBC hit of the mid-1980s, for three and a half years. He helped
create its spinoff, ``A Different World.'' He was introduced to a
comedian known then as Roseanne Barr and was a co-creator of her
sitcom, ``Roseanne,'' but left after the first 13 weeks. (Don't
ask.)
</P>
<P>
   He did the unusual comedy anthology ``Carol and Co.'' with Carol
Burnett in 1990 and 1991. Then he was introduced to yet another
successful stand-up comic, Tim Allen, with thoughts of turning his
act into a television series. After their first lunch with Allen,
Williams turned to Carmen Finestra, one of his Wind Dancer
partners, and predicted the project would turn into a top 10 show.
It did. ``Home Improvement'' was a huge hit on ABC from 1991 to
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about power tools,'' he says of the show, which
starred Allen as the host of a fictional how-to cable show called
``Tool Time.'' ``The series is about men and women. They shouldn't
live together, but they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been married to Angelina Fiordellisi, who owns and
manages the Cherry Lane Theater in Manhattan, for 13 years. They
have a daughter, Matisse, 12, and a son, Fredrick, 10. And they are
all full-time New Yorkers, which was not the case toward the end of
the ``Home Improvement'' years.
</P>
<P>
   That was, Williams says, the unhappiest period of his life. ``I
fell into what's known in the industry as mogulitis,'' he says. ``I
had become a business manager.'' So he downsized Wind Dancer and
decided to focus on feature films. That was about the time Susan
Cartsonis joined the company, raving about ``Where the Heart Is,''
a book she had almost gotten produced at her last job, with 20th
Century Fox. Wind Dancer obtained the rights and started looking
for writers.
</P>
<P>
   They chose Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, whose past films
include ``City Slicker,'' ``Splash,'' ``Parenthood'' and ``EdTV.''
Although Ganz knew little about Williams at first _ ``To me, he was
like a tycoon. He was the guy who had struck gold in the TV sitcom
world'' _ he now describes him in glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the kind of director,'' says Ganz, ``who says, `What
do you think?' and means, `Don't you love it?' When Matt says that,
he really wants to know. He's like Ron Howard in that way. It's so
much better if you're not tiptoeing around someone's ego, if ego
doesn't get bruised by the normal collaborative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockard Channing, who plays against type in ``Where the Heart
Is,'' compares Williams in some ways to Mike Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that same sort of eye-of-the-hurricane quality,''
Channing says. ``He's so calm under fire. He really held his
ground, and that is a good 90 percent of being a director.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is also like Nichols, she added, in that both believe
``you hire the best people, then just step out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly worked with Channing's character, Sister Husband, a
colorful Oklahoman who runs a welcome wagon from a backfiring
turquoise Dodge pickup truck, bakes for neighbors even when a
tornado is coming and asks God's forgiveness for her latest act of
fornication whenever she says grace.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel Sister was a blue-haired 70-year-old; as Channing
she's more of an earth mother (inspired partly, Channing says, by
her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who died in 1991).
</P>
<P>
   While moviegoers decide whether they will take Channing,
Portman, Ashley Judd, Sally Field, Joan Cusack, James Frain and the
rest of the ``Where the Heart Is'' cast to their hearts, Williams,
who turned 49 last Tuesday, is moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that television money is going back into New York
theater. Wind Dancer has commissioned several plays which will be
produced Off Broadway. Williams is producing ``The Bubbly Black
Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,'' Kirsten Childs' coming-of-age
musical, at Playwrights Horizons. And on the side he's at work on
the script of the next film he will direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly intense, a little darker in tone'' than ``Where
the Heart Is,'' he says, declining to give specifics. ``In the
Midwest everything is not Rockwellian.''

ANOTHER ARTIST'S HEIRS FIGHT MARLBOROUGH GALLERY
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marlborough, the international art gallery heavily fined in 1975
for defrauding the Mark Rothko estate and accused in court last
month of cheating the Francis Bacon estate, is also fighting a
legal battle over the estate of Kurt Schwitters, the German Dadaist
known for his collages, who died in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In the Schwitters case, a lower court in Norway ruled against
the gallery in 1998, deciding that Marlborough's actions gave the
artist's heirs grounds for terminating the gallery's contract. But
an appeals court in Oslo reversed that decision on March 29 and
awarded Marlborough $1.2 million in compensation, about a third of
the sum the gallery had sought, plus court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Both courts made narrow decisions on the contract dispute,
briefly criticizing Marlborough, a global network of galleries
founded in 1946, but not commenting at length about the way it
conducts business.
</P>
<P>
   The lower court had awarded the Schwitters family nearly $4
million, plus court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kurth, the Cologne lawyer for Marlborough International
Fine Art, the Liechtenstein branch that is party to the Schwitters
suit, said he was delighted by the victory and the size of the
award.
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, however, Dag Thorstensen, a lawyer representing Lola
Schwitters, the widow of Ernst Schwitters, the artist's son and
heir, and their son, Bengt, said they would appeal the decision to
Norway's supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over artists' estates are not uncommon, lawyers
said, but they rarely involve such high-profile artists or such
serious allegations. And galleries usually prefer to settle them
out of court, away from the headlines that have dogged Marlborough
since the legal spectacle between its New York gallery and the
children of Rothko, the abstract expressionist who committed
suicide in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In that 11-year-long court battle, which has some similarities
to the Schwitters and Bacon cases, Marlborough was found to have
sold more than 100 paintings at less than market value to favored
clients while it collected inflated commissions at the expense of
the estate. The court fined the gallery, its founder, Frank Lloyd,
and the estate's executors more than $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bacon case, filed in London on March 21, lawyers for his
estate accused Marlborough branches in London and Vaduz,
Liechtenstein, of wrongfully exploiting Bacon in a relationship
that began in 1958 and was ``manifestly disadvantageous'' to him
until his death in 1992, and then to his estate. The suit alleges
that Marlborough in London grossly underpaid Bacon for his works
and then resold them through its Liechtenstein branch at much
higher prices. It also contends that Marlborough has never supplied
a complete accounting of Bacon's works and sales and that
Marlborough handled some works it has never accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Marlborough in London declined to respond to
questions about the Bacon suit. Georgiana Gibbs, their spokeswoman,
said that Marlborough's lawyers would answer the allegations when
they file their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three cases differ in substantial ways, the
disputes do resemble one another. They began decades ago, when
Lloyd, a charming and ambitious refugee from Vienna, ran the
galleries, paying at least as much attention to business as he did
to art. In all three cases, Marlborough had exclusive rights to
sell the artists' works. According to court documents, it
controlled the artworks, kept the records and, on some occasions,
refused to provide complete information about them to the heirs.
</P>
<P>
   It set prices, often low, with little or no consultation. It
moved art among its branches, most frequently to Liechtenstein. The
Liechtenstein office often buys works from other Marlborough
branches, then resells them at higher prices _ allowing Marlborough
to reap its largest profits in low-tax Liechtenstein, which is also
known for its secrecy laws. (Few other galleries, if any, have
copied Marlborough's Vaduz strategy, which is legal.)
</P>
<P>
   Marlborough's movement of the art complicated the three
disputes: when heirs or their lawyers asked one gallery for
information, it stalled or claimed no knowledge and referred the
inquirer to another Marlborough branch.
</P>
<P>
   Rothko, Bacon and Ernst Schwitters each used Marlborough
employees or people associated with the company as lawyers,
accountants or both and in two cases as estate trustees, creating
potential conflicts of interest. And Marlborough is known or said
to have moved potential evidence _ paintings or documents _ out of
the courts' jurisdiction in the first two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Swiss bank accounts and other financial arrangements made
with Francis Bacon and Ernst Schwitters also figure into those two
cases, suggesting that the two may have colluded with Marlborough
to evade income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley N. Bergman, a lawyer in New York who represents
Marlborough's owners, five trusts established for the heirs of
Frank Lloyd, rejected the idea that the cases are similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Rothko case, the gallery made a mistake,'' he said.
``Frank Lloyd was wearing two hats. But in the Bacon and Schwitters
cases, the deals were made with the artists while they were alive,
and the heirs are looking for something more. Maybe the heirs feel
that because of the Rothko case they should investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew of no other such suits against Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, the lawyer in Germany, added that the Norwegian courts
had rejected efforts to introduce testimony about the Rothko case
in the Schwitters dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwitters case, which began in the mid-1990s, is
complicated. It involves a fight between Lola Schwitters and Ernst
Schwitters' mistress as well the gallery, specifically Marlborough
in Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurt Schwitters died, Ernst, a Norwegian citizen, inherited
nearly 700 artworks now worth tens of millions of dollars. In 1963
he began a relationship with Marlborough. The last contract, signed
in 1986, gave Marlborough International Fine Arts the exclusive
right to sell art from the estate and entrusted all works to
Marlborough for safekeeping.
</P>

   Around 1989, Ernst Schwitters began an affair with an
Englishwoman, eventually leaving Norway to live with her. Four
years later, Schwitters suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed
and unable to speak. His wife tried to move him back to Norway, but
the mistress objected, and the dispute landed in British courts.
Because of that battle, a Norwegian court appointed Tone Bjorn, a
Norwegian lawyer, as Ernst's guardian in 1994. Schwitters returned
to Norway, and Bjorn began asking Marlborough for information about
his assets.
</P>
<P>
   But Marlborough contested her appointment in court and declined
to give her information, according to the courts' chronologies,
arguing that the requested data were ``trade secrets.''

UNDATED: ``trade secrets.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marlborough also refused to pay Bjorn's expenses from bank
accounts that Ernst Schwitters had established in Switzerland (and
not declared to the Norwegian tax authorities, court documents
say). Schwitters had given control of the accounts to his mistress
and to Gilbert Lloyd, Frank Lloyd's son, who is based at
Marlborough's London branch.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn's guardianship was also approved by Swiss courts, but
Marlborough then moved the Schwitters' bank accounts to
Liechtenstein, again out of her reach.
</P>
<P>
   Marlborough also delayed payment to the estate of nearly $6
million raised from the 1994 sale of 39 Schwitters works to a
German museum. Marlborough maintained that it could not pay
proceeds from the sale because of legal uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Bjorn gave notice to Marlborough terminating its
contract. She claimed that the gallery, among other things, had
failed to provide a usable inventory of the Schwitters works, had
refused to disclose the location and value of the works and had
made late and only partial payments from the sale to the German
museum. Marlborough promptly sued for breach of contract and loss
of income on future sales. Bjorn countersued to obtain the
Schwitters works in Marlborough's possession.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Norway, Bjorn, 47, who had experience as a
court-appointed guardian before the Schwitters case, said: ``I had
never been treated that way before. Their hostility was difficult
to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But after a while,'' she added, ``I understood that
Marlborough had its own agenda and that's why they acted the way
they did. They wanted to keep Ernst Schwitters in Britain because
that made it easier for them to sell more pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Marlborough, Kurth said that he in turn found it
hard to understand her comments. ``We tried to assist her in every
conceivable way,'' he said. Marlborough employees wrote letters
explaining the workings of the art market, he said, and offered to
meet with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Schwitters died in December 1996, leaving everything to
his wife, Lola, who succeeded Bjorn in the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Marlborough agreed out of court to surrender the works
in its possession to the Schwitters family. Subsequently, both
Norwegian courts have considered only the question of whether
Marlborough's behavior toward the estate was justification for
terminating its contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 lower-court decision, the judge said that
termination of the contract by Bjorn was justified and called
Marlborough's conduct toward her ``reprehensible.'' He ruled that
Marlborough had defaulted on its obligation to pay the proceeds
from sales into an account she could have access to. But it said
the estate had failed to prove that this act was part of an attempt
to misappropriate its assets.
</P>
<P>
   The March 29 ruling, however, said that Marlborough did face
ambiguity about where the proceeds from the art sales should go and
that its actions did not breach its contract. The decision
reproached Marlborough ``for not having given Ms. Bjorn information
about earlier transactions and about the works of art at an earlier
point in time than May 9, 1995,'' and it criticized Bengt
Schwitters for adopting an ``uncompromising attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The family now has control of the Schwitters artworks, and it
has not yet appointed another gallery as agent. And it vows that
its court battle with Marlborough will continue. Thorstensen, the
family lawyer, said that an appeal would be filed by June 3.  &QL;

 &HT;    UNEXPLODED GERMAN BOMB CAUSES EVACUATION IN BRITAIN
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON, Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Nearly 60 years after German airplanes menaced the
skies overhead, hundreds of suburban Londoners were evacuated
Wednesday after workmen discovered a 1,000-pound World War II bomb
at a
</P>
<P>
   construction site.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was discovered Tuesday at a building site in
Bexleyheath about 12 miles southeast of central London. It was
positioned nose-down about six feet underground.
</P>
<P>
   Still demonstrating the stubborn resolve Britons displayed in
the face of Hitler's relentless air assault, some residents
resisted attempts Wednesday to move them out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some residents were reluctant to leave their homes,'' said
police Maj. Bob Tomkins, who oversaw the bomb disposal operation.
``I think that while it might have been quite laudable in the 1940s
with the great
</P>
<P>
   British Bulldog spirit, I don't think it appropriate any more.
They could do more to assist those who are here to protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   After several hours, everyone agreed to leave, providing
military sappers the space they need to go about the delicate work
of disarming the massive weapon. When the bomb was deposited in
Bexleyheath by the Luftwaffe, it was capable of throwing shrapnel
about 6,000 feet from the point of impact.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people were evacuated from nearly 1,000 homes,
police said. Traffic was diverted away from the bomb site, causing
rush hour chaos for commuters. As night fell, a 15-member bomb
squad worked
</P>
<P>
   gingerly with the bomb in a defusing process that was expected
to take 10 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   Unexploded bombs are found fairly regularly in Britain. On the
approach to primary targets in the city, Bexleyheath was hit by 486
bombs in 1940 and 7,500 in 1941, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, air raid wardens tried to keep track of where
bombs fell but there were far too many bombs for them to accurately
record. Nearly 19,000 tons of high explosives were dropped by the
Luftwaffe on
</P>
<P>
   the capital between September 1940 and May 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The government has identified at least 100 bombs beneath homes,
businesses and parks in London. Officials have decided that it is
best to let the bombs alone unless they become unstable.

 &HT;    Daft deftly handles intense annual meeting
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ The Coca-Cola Co.'s annual meeting Wednesday
was unlike any other in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The Playhouse Theater provided the perfect setting for a
corporate drama that unfolded over two hours and 40 minutes, the
longest Coca-Cola annual meeting anyone can remember. And it could
have gone on much longer. More than a dozen people were still
standing at six microphones at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Daft's first annual meeting as chief executive and chairman
held numerous plot twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   A call to boycott Coca-Cola products was made by current and
former African-American employees. Civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson was invited to make a statement in the middle of the
meeting. There was also the threat of a possible future boycott by
people opposed to the use of genetically engineered crops in
Coca-Cola's products.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder after shareholder rose to criticize the company,
though hardly any mention was made of the dramatic drop in
Coca-Cola's stock price over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the meeting did not come as a surprise to company
executives. The first frame of an opening video at the start of the
meeting flashed a quote from Albert Einstein: ``In the middle of
difficulty lies opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the message Daft wanted to convey to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite telling shareholders they would be given three minutes
each to speak, Daft repeatedly allowed speakers to exceed the time
limit. He stood silently at the podium until speakers were finished
and then invariably offered a personal response or anecdote,
seeking to connect with the shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting proceeded in an orderly manner with one exception.
In the middle of the meeting, someone shouted from the audience,
calling for the company to recycle more of its containers. Then a
group of students in the balcony begin to chant, ``Promise to
recycle, promise to recycle.'' After waiting a moment, Daft looked
up at them and said, ``I think you are a bit out of tune.'' The
meeting continued with no further outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Directors seemed pleased with how Daft conducted himself at the
sometimes tense meeting. ``Anytime you have a lot of protests at an
annual meeting, it tests the patience of the executive officer,''
said former Sen. Sam Nunn, a partner with King and Spalding law
firm. ``Doug Daft was cool, calm, collected and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Daft handled the meeting perfectly,'' said Herbert
Allen, another director. ``I think his statements toward diversity
couldn't have been more appropriate. He held an open meeting. I
don't think there was a person in the room, whether their
statements were pertinent or not, who did not feel they had an
opportunity to speak their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Ronald W. Allen, retired CEO of Delta Air Lines, noted
the meeting was quite different from other annual meetings he has
attended. ``There was a lot more open discussion and subjects
discussed at this annual meeting than in other years. I thought it
was a good open discussion from people with sincere concerns. I
think the chairman did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Warren Buffet, the largest individual shareholder of
Coca-Cola, wasn't quite as generous in his assessment: ``I'm not in
a commenting mood today.''

COMPLYING WITH COURT ORDER, ISRAEL FREES 13 LEBANESE PRISONERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After spending years in prison in Israel without
charges, 13 Lebanese detainees were driven Wednesday morning in a
caged van to the border. There they waited into the late afternoon,
blindfolded and handcuffed, while a last legal wrinkle was ironed
out in their case.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after the Israeli Supreme Court rejected an 11th-hour
petition to keep the men behind bars, Israeli soldiers handed them
over to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the men
crossed back into Lebanon. Boarding a bus at the Fatma Gate, one
detainee raised his hands to the sky, covered his face and shook
his head in relief and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lebanese town of Kfar Tibnit, relatives and supporters
had been waiting for days to greet the men, whose release date kept
getting postponed. By the time the detainees' bus arrived, hundreds
mobbed it, some throwing rice, some weeping, and some fainting from
emotion. The men flashed the ``V-for-Victory'' sign out the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   But, to their relatives' frustration, their bus then rolled on
for a two-hour tour through the Lebanese countryside, orchestrated
by the Hezbollah Shiite Muslim group. The relatives followed
behind, in a convoy that snaked back 100 vehicles. Only at
Hezbollah headquarters, after the men kneeled at the feet of the
leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, did the families finally get to
embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Hijazi, who was ``a baby without a beard'' when his older
sister last saw him in 1986, looked pale and slight and overwhelmed
by the many relatives who smothered him with affection.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hijazi, several of the men had been imprisoned for more
than a decade, since they were teen-agers. Starting in the
mid-1980s, they had been abducted from Lebanon, convicted as
guerrilla sympathizers, and, after serving brief sentences, held as
``bargaining chips'' for missing Israeli soldiers. Some never stood
trial at all.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, reversing a decision it issued in 1997, the Israeli
Supreme Court ruled that the men posed no threat to state security
and that their continued detention was illegal. It ordered them
freed, setting off a fervid week of debate in Israel about whether
the ends justify the means in the society's search for their
missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by the relatives of missing soldiers, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, a former general, secured his cabinet's approval to
craft legislation that would allow Israel to hold ``illegal
fighters'' as hostages to retrieve missing or captured soldiers.
The cabinet said it would seek to do so in a way that would not
contravene the High Court decision or international law, although
legal experts said that would be tricky, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   To the disappointment of the relatives, Barak and his ministers
refused to intervene in the case already decided by the court. That
sent the relatives of a missing Israeli airman, Ron Arad, scurrying
back to the Supreme Court on Tuesday night to file their second
petition of the week seeking to block the detainees' release.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Wednesday, punctuated by the sobs of relatives,
lasted several hours as the judges heard arguments that the
detainees should remain in custody until the new legislation was
passed. Batya Arad, the mother of Ron Arad, pleaded with the
judges, telling them that her son, who was captured by Lebanese
guerrillas in 1986, had been missing for 4,969 days and nights. His
family believes that he is still alive, held by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look me straight in the eyes,'' Arad implored with a trembling
voice. ``What would you do if your son or grandson were in the same
situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Aharon Barak said the state would continue to do
everything possible to obtain information about missing soldiers,
but that it had to be done ``within the confines of the law.''
Earlier in the week, several Israeli officials, including the
justice minister and the internal security minister, argued that,
moral and legal issues aside, the detention of the Lebanese simply
had not worked to secure information about Israeli prisoners of war
or their release.
</P>
<P>
   Israel did not release two remaining detainees, Mustafa
al-Dirani, who was a militia leader of the Amal guerrilla group,
and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a spiritual leader of Hezbollah. The
government argued that those two men did represent threats to
national security, and a hearing on their case was scheduled for
May 8.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Kfar Tibnit, waiting on the one-lane country road as the
rumors ebbed and flowed about whether the men would actually be
released, Malik Yassine, 53, said he felt like he had been waiting
forever. Hezbollah trucks blared patriotic music and military
marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last week felt as long as the whole 14 years,'' Yassine
said. He was waiting to welcome home his brother-in-law, Abou
Biklal Bikrou.
</P>
<P>
   Sikna Khoul, 65, who is the mother of Hijazi, said her son was
abducted at the age of 14 by officials of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
   The officials took him because of a dispute with the family, she
said, insisting that her son was not a resistance fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a broken leg at the time,'' his sister, Jamila said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, they had received both letters and
videos from Hijazi. He always told them that he was in good health,
and that someday he would enjoy his freedom. They worried about him
incessantly. Today, when they caught their first glimpse of his
face through the window, they simulataneously burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, Alia, another sister, had kept his watch for
safekeeping. ``It's no longer ticking,'' she said. ``It's been too
much time.''

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Gary Karr, the only person charged thus far in
connection with the disappearance of atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair,
will go on trial May 15 in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, who has been behind bars for the past year, is charged
with five federal counts, including kidnapping and robbing the
O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin Murray
O'Hair, disappeared in late September 1995 after receiving $500,000
in gold coins in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI believes the O'Hairs were kidnapped, killed and
dismembered, their bodies have not been found. The government
claims to have recovered genetic evidence from an Austin storage
shed indicating they were murdered there.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's lawyer, Thomas Mills of Dallas, says federal prosecutors
will first have to prove the O'Hair family is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several issues we'll seriously contest, including
whether the O'Hairs were in fact murdered or if they are out of
sight due to other circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit filed last spring in federal court in
Austin, authorities claimed Karr, David Waters and a third man
named Danny Fry abducted the O'Hairs and then murdered them for the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Fry later turned up as a headless, handless corpse in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Karr has acknowledged that he helped Mr. Waters in
assisting the O'Hairs to dispose of assets and leave Texas, and
that is not a crime,'' said Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who is serving a lengthy state prison term for stealing
$54,400 from the O'Hairs while their office manager, has not been
charged in their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have described him as the mastermind of the plot to
do in the O'Hairs. Karr and Waters have long criminal records, and
the two met as inmates in the Illinois prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's case will be heard by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, who
has a reputation for keeping things moving in his courtroom. Sparks
has allotted three weeks for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case is going to trial after government efforts to cut a
deal with Karr in exchange for his testimony against Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Carruth, the assistant U.S. Attorney who will present the
government's case against Karr, declined to comment Wednesday.

   WHERE-THE-HEART-IS-FILM (Undated) _ People don't get much more
alone in the world than Novalee Nation in the early scenes of
``Where the Heart Is.'' She's 17, very pregnant and even barefoot _
since her shoes fell through a huge hole in the car floor somewhere
between Tennessee and Oklahoma. On the drive from her trailer-park
home to a new life in California, she makes the mistake of asking
her boyfriend to stop at a Wal-Mart so she can go to the bathroom.
When she returns to the parking lot, he and the car are gone.
Novalee (Natalie Portman, looking radiant but very un-Queen
Amidala-like) does the only thing she can think of, since she
doesn't know a soul in Sequoyah, Okla. She goes back into the
store, and when it closes for the night (while she's in the ladies'
room) she just stays. Thanks to the camping, patio furniture and
exercise equipment departments and shelves full of magazines and
working alarm clocks, she's quite comfortable for six weeks. After
she goes into labor there she's a local celebrity, and little by
little she builds a life in Sequoyah, with the usual ups and downs,
weddings and funerals, kidnappings and tornados. Directed by Matt
Williams, ``Where the Heart Is,'' opens on Friday. By Anita Gates.

   POPULAR-CULTURE-FILMS (Undated) _ What do we really talk about
with our friends when we're not discussing the vicissitudes of our
personal lives? Why, popular culture, of course! Much of the
conversational glue that binds us together comes from the stuff
that wafts off television, movie and computer screens, from our
stereo speakers and headsets. But go to almost any Hollywood movie,
and you'll find a strange absence on screen of palaver about
recordings, movies, television shows and popular fiction. That's
one reason that when a film comes along that acknowledges the
passions millions of us harbor about favorite works of popular art,
it can strike a deep chord of recognition. Two of the best American
movies released this year _ ``American Psycho'' and ``High
Fidelity'' _ show a bone-deep understanding of how much of our
emotional energy is invested in the consumption of popular culture.

   LISA-KRUEGER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The writer and director Lisa
Krueger, 39, has made only two movies, but the longing for
structure is a central theme in both. Indeed, some of the most
touching moments in her 1996 indie debut ``Manny and Lo'' involve
watching how the lives of two underage orphan runaways (Scarlett
Johannsen and Aleska Palladino) are enriched when they kidnap a
discipline-driven woman (Mary Kay Place) and the three become a
makeshift family. As for Joline (Heather Graham), the nightclub
manager heroine of Ms. Krueger's latest film, ``Committed''
(opening Friday), she finds comfort in structure, too. But her
quest _ to save an unraveling marriage by hunting down her wayward
photojournalist husband, Carl (Luke Wilson) _ comes at the expense
of her happiness and, eventually, her own sanity. By Margy Rochlin.

   BIG-KAHUNA-FILM (New York) _ Last winter, the cast and crew of
``The Big Kahuna'' filmed a feature in the time some people spend

Spacey and Danny DeVito. Adapted by Roger Rueff from his play
``Hospitality Suite,'' the 90-minute film, directed by John

   BOUND-FOR-GLORY-VIDEO (Undated) _ Hal Ashby's 1976 film
biography of the militant singer-composer Woody Guthrie, ``Bound

isn't bad for a film with some weaknesses to go along with its
considerable strengths. Ashby, who died at age 59 in 1988 and whose
credits include ``Harold and Maude'' (1971), ``Shampoo'' (1975) and
``Being There'' (1979), had a feeling for quirky characters.

her long, blond hair. Onstage, her persona is fiercer. During her
22-year dance career, Chouinard has been called everything from
``the high priestess of choreographic shock'' and ``a sorceress''
to ``the praying mantis in the hothouse of Quebec dance.'' Many of
her solo dances _ including the first, ``Crystallization'' (1978) _

she became a noted Off Broadway performance artist and director,
collaborated with Meredith Monk and painted. Her younger brother,
Bert Swezea, stayed behind, becoming a popular real estate agent in
Seattle, where he married and had two sons. Their decidedly
different-seeming paths rejoined in 1992, when Nagrin received news
that Buddy, as she called him, was seriously ill in Maui, Hawaii,
where he had formed a new life of the spirit. Nagrin traveled to
Hawaii to be with her brother, who died the following year. Out of
that experience has come ``The Valley of Iao,'' which opens on

Pinter's ``Celebration'' at the company's grungy headquarters in
Islington. Then it presented Nicholas Wright's new ``Cressida'' in
the West End, with a magnificently dilapidated Sir Michael Gambon
as a trainer of the boy actors who took female roles in
early-17th-century England. And now it has reopened the doors of
the East End film studios once used by Alfred Hitchcock and staged

Cyril, one of the last century's best-known Irish performers, but
having been born into celebrity, Cusack proceeded to marry a man
who became one: Jeremy Irons, the film star. Cusack, however, has
garnered an impressive share of acting renown of her own. Last week
she opened Off Broadway at the Irish Repertory Theater in Sebastian
Barry's ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' reprising a role that won her a

Peter Shaffer (``Amadeus'') and Tom Stoppard (``The Real Thing'').

nothing new, of course. The booty historian could trace the genre
back to medieval maypole dances or, in modernist times,
Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.'' The latter not only depicts the
primitive fertility rituals at the root of today's spring singles
but also uses music more dependent on rhythm than melody, with the
fast-driving string ostinatos and emphatic percussive downbeats
that are at the core of Sisqo's ``Thong Song.'' The song, a
celebration of glimpses of scanty female underwear by Sisqo of the
rhythm-and-blues group Dru Hill, was bubbling well under the Top
40. But by last week, with spring love in the air and spring break

SECURITY GUARD IN KENNEDY CASE HAS RECORD, DOCUMENTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A female security guard who accused Representative
Patrick J. Kennedy of assaulting her in Los Angeles International
Airport has a four-decade history of arrests herself, including
cocaine and theft charges, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Della Patton, 58, also appears to have used more than one fake
name, a history that could be used to undercut her credibility if
she chooses to file a civil complaint against Kennedy, whom she
said injured her arm during the altercation on March 26, a source
familiar with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat, has admitted that he acted
rudely toward Patton, brusquely showing his identification and
demanding to pass through airport security even though he was
carrying an oversized bag. But he rebuts allegations that he
physically harmed her.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, however, insists Kennedy grabbed and shoved her when she
tried to enforce standard airport regulations and that the
altercation rendered her incapable of continuing work. She is
collecting worker's compensation and is on paid leave from her job.
News of the confrontation became public when Patton told her story
to the National Enquirer earlier this month. Neither a criminal nor
civil charge against Kennedy has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's lawyer, Paul D. Trump, rebutted reports that he had
sought a financial settlement for his client. ``That wasn't the
case,'' Trump said of earlier accounts that he phoned Kennedy's
Washington lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, to demand a sum. ``That's
Washington capitalism, Democrat politics. . . . I don't know where
everybody gets their news.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his client's past scrapes with the law, Trump said, ``I don't
know anything about that.'' Trump said he began representing Patton
only at the time of her altercation with Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   According to California court papers, Patton has pleaded guilty
to petty theft and cocaine possession charges and has a history of
susbtance abuse. In addition to two married names, she also appears
to have gone by at least two aliases, Vessie Carter and Vessie
Truitt.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy declined to comment.

RAYTHEON POSTS $181 MILLION LOSS IN FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. Wednesday posted a first-quarter loss of $181
million, chiefly related to the sale of its heavy-construction
unit, compared to net income of $205 million for the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Income from continuing operations at the Lexington, Mass.
defense contractor was $80 million, or 24 cents a share, down from
$240 million, or 71 cents a share, for the same period a year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Net revenue dipped 3 percent, to $4.23 billion from $4.34
billion a year before, a decrease driven by lower sales of missiles
and information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The results were in line with the expectations of analysts
tracking the company's efforts to restore its profitability after a
series of earnings disappointments and a steep decline in its share
price.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, said it will
buy Raytheon's Engineers &AMP; Constructors unit for about $10 million
in cash and assume about $500 million in liabilities. Raytheon
recorded a $191 million loss on the sale, equivalent to 77 cents a
share, and has classified the unit as a discontinued operation for
accounting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Some had hoped the unit might fetch more cash for Raytheon,
which forecasts it will have net debt of $9 billion to $9.2 billion
at the end of this year. Problems at the construction unit
contributed to the quarter's losses, as Raytheon had previously
warned.
</P>
<P>
   But on a conference call with analysts, chief executive Daniel
Burnham said Raytheon's performance otherwise was ``an important
first step in repositioning the company for 2001 and beyond.'' He
cited new revenue the company may receive for upcoming missile
contracts and work on the National Missile Defense Program.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham and chief financial officer Frank Caine wouldn't rule
out additional sales. But they said they would focus on selling off
smaller divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also praised a draft report prepared by a Pentagon panel
that suggested changes in the way the military buys and pays for
its equipment, such as allowing contractors to keep a greater share
of their cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report also contains criticism of defense-company
management. But if certain of its suggestions are implemented,
Burnham said, they would benefit Raytheon's bottom line by
``hundreds of millions of dollars of pretax profit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a wonderful job of taking costs out'' through
quality-control programs, he said. ``But the reality is we have to
give a lot of it away'' to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Following the sale of the construction unit, Raytheon revised
its profit outlook for 2000. It now expects profit of $1.40 to
$1.55 a share. Analysts had expected the company to report $1.50 to
$1.75 a share for the year, according to First Call/Thompson
Financial.

Exchange trading after the results were announced.

 &HT;    McCain says he misled voters, urges flag be taken down
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Dragging South Carolina's fight over the
Confederate flag back into the national spotlight, Republican John
McCain said Wednesday he misled voters about his opposition to the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who was defeated in the GOP primary
campaign by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said he believed all along
that the flag should be removed from atop South Carolina's capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A descendent of Confederate soldiers, McCain said he was
dishonest when asked during South Carolina's presidential primary
for his personal views on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he repeatedly said the issue should be decided by South
Carolinians. He noted that some view it as a racist symbol, and
others cherish its heritage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain admitted Wednesday the answer was a politically motivated
dodge that ''broke my promise to always tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the
South Carolina primary,'' McCain told the South Carolina Policy
Council on his first visit to the state since Bush easily won the
Feb. 19 primary. ''So I chose to compromise my principles.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke bluntly Wednesday, saying Confederate soldiers
''fought on the wrong side of American history.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jake Knotts, R-Columbia, said he was disgusted by
McCain, whom he had supported during the state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he would lie on the campaign trail, he is no better than
Bill Clinton,'' said Knotts, a flag supporter. ''I feel he should
not come to South Carolina and inject his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vince Ellison, a Republican running against James Clyburn,
the incumbent Democrat in South Carolina's 6th Congressional
District, said McCain ''cleared his conscious, which is good. A lot
of politicians could learn from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating criticism from ''all sides for my late act of
contrition,'' McCain said he decided several weeks ago to travel to
Columbia, after deciding to apologize. He said the trip was not
intended to pressure Bush to reexamine his flag stance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, had said it was an issue for South Carolinians to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Eskew, Bush's press secretary in South Carolina, said
Bush had predicted that after the primary, ''South Carolinians of
good will would make progress toward a resolution. He was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a state House Judiciary subcommittee began debating
flag proposals, including a bill the state Senate passed last week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered advice, though he said his ''dishonesty'' had
''severely diminished'' its value in the flag fight.
</P>
<P>
   He urged South Carolinians to ''find common ground on which to
bury past injustice and commemorate a heritage, an American
heritage, that respects the dignity of all mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the state Legislature to move the flag, which the
body raised atop the Statehouse in 1962 as part of a Civil War
centennial. Tens of thousands of people on both sides have marched
in Columbia, including a 120-mile, Charleston-to-Columbia trek led
by flag opponent Joseph Riley, Charleston's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think marches and comment from third-party outsiders
is going to resolve this issue,'' House Speaker David Wilkins said
Wednesday before the subcommittee's public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville Republican said he was ''cautiously optimistic''
about the Legislature reaching a flag compromise before the body
adjourns June 1.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the bill passed by the Senate provides the
best opportunity for a speedy resolution, though he acknowledged
its many critics.
</P>
<P>
   The state NAACP on Wednesday reiterated its opposition, saying
it may seek to join forces with staunch flag supporters who also
oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remove the flag from atop the Statehouse. It
would be replaced by a different, smaller Confederate flag, hoisted
on a flagpole behind the Confederate soldiers' monument on the
Statehouse grounds at Main and Gervais streets.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which has vowed to continue its national economic
boycott of South Carolina, says that busy downtown intersection
provides the flag too visible a location. Flag supporters say the
flag deserves a place of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This state is in trouble because of this flag; people are torn
asunder,'' said state Rep. Joe Neal, D-Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill's sponsor, Sen. Robert Ford, D-Charleston,
warned House Judiciary Committee members that tinkering with the
legislation will doom it, leaving little hope for removing the flag
this session.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do not vote for this bill, you are in bed with the
Confederacy,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   But several House members said the Senate bill fails to bring
''finality'' the the flag dispute.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the African-American House
minority leader, said she and colleagues were preparing an
amendment to the Senate bill that ''will bring closure, with
healing.'' Borrowing from other proposals, she said the plan would
include a healing pool and a circle of flags on the Statehouse
grounds.

TENNESSEE HOLDS FIRST EXECUTION IN 40 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Early Wednesday morning, Tennessee executed its
first death row inmate in 40 years. The inmate, Robert Glen Coe,
44, was killed by lethal injection for the 1979 rape and murder of
8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin in the West Tennessee town of
Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful that the judicial system has finally, after 21
long years in the state of Tennessee, honored, remembered and
fulfilled its obligation to Cary Ann's right to life,'' the girl's
mother, Charlotte Stout, told reporters outside the prison just
minutes after witnessing the execution. ``She had a right to live,
and he took that from her.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stout spoke, Coe's family left the prison without talking to
representatives of the news media. But in an eerie moment, one of
Coe's sisters could be heard wailing in the background just as
Stout was remembering her daughter's last words to her killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do not forget Cary's words, `Jesus loves you,''' Stout
said. ``These are her legacy to her killer, to Robert Coe's family
and to us. My child will finally rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee had been the only state in the former Confederacy that
had not executed anyone since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976
that the death penalty did not inherently violate the Constitution.
The South leads the nation by far in the number of executions
carried out since that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last month, Coe had come within hours of execution,
but he received stays by federal courts reviewing his mental
competency. A federal appeals court found him mentally competent,
and the Supreme Court denied his last appeal, on Tuesday. He was
pronounced dead at 1:37 a.m. at the Riverbend Maximum Security
Prison here.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bruce Nieli of St. Patrick's Church in Memphis led a
move to grant Coe clemency, and was with the inmate just before he
was executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight begins Passover,'' Nieli told reporters outside the
prison. ``In a few days we will have Good Friday, Easter Sunday.
How inappropriate to have the death penalty at a time when so many
of our people are praying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cold and dark early morning Wednesday, about 100
opponents of capital punishment held a candlelight vigil in a
designated area on the prison grounds. Among the demonstrators was
Jacob Chrisman, a 16-year-old high school sophomore in Nashville.
He was one of 18 people arrested at Gov. Don Sundquist's residence
on Tuesday morning in protest of the governor's refusal to block
Coe's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the reason behind killing people who kill
people,'' the youth said, ``to show that killing people is wrong.''

   HAVANA _ As they ended a four-day foray to Cuba Wednesday,
representatives of several Massachusetts universities said they had
laid the groundwork for ongoing exchanges of students and scholars,
exhibits of Cuban art, and shared research in marine science,
pharmacy, and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Congressmen John J. Moakley and James P. McGovern,
both strong critics of the US trade embargo against Cuba, organized
the delegation of 48 college presidents and scholars, the largest
US group to travel to Cuba in 40 years. The goal, they said, was to
forge links with Cuban academics and open lines of communication
shut down by 39 years of US sanctions. The delegation returns to
Boston Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Moakley said he was excited by the results,
especially by the one-on-one talks that bubbled up outside the
tightly organized and sometimes sterile meetings between the
educators and Cuban government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with these meetings is that often there is no
follow-up,'' Moakley said. ``This group has been jubilant about the
meetings and the contacts. It has been a kind of awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   In one concrete result, the Schepens Eye Research Institute in
Boston, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, agreed to send up
to 50 post-doctoral researchers to work in Cuba and to accept a
Cuban doctoral student on a fellowship. The institute and the
University of Havana signed a letter of intent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts College of Pharmancy, one of only three
independent pharmacy schools in the United States, is making plans
to send faculty to study alternative medicine, a growing field
among US doctors. Herbal medicine is standard practice in Cuba,
where shortages of mainstream medications are common, noted Charles
Monahan, the college's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing what they have brought me back 30 years to when I was
in pharmacy school and we used to make our own cough syrups and
suppositories,'' said Monahan. ``They had little brown bags of
medicine in drawers. I would like to send our faculty to see their
alternative medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Assumption College in Worcester, which is launching a Latin
American studies program next fall, would like to bring Cuban
graduate students to work as teaching assistants and as ``role
models of Cuban culture,'' said Thomas Plough, the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also potential for our students, who could come here
for immersion Spanish, and Cuban history, and mission work in
community service projects,'' Plough said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge, as the educators saw it, is how to
activate these relationships without contravening the financial
intricacies of the embargo. Many were unsure whether they could
legally pay or financially support the Cubans while in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu meeting late Tuesday, Cuba's minister of
culture, Abel Prieto, complained that the embargo has kept Cubans
from reading the latest American literature. Speaking in Spanish,
he described a visit last fall of playwright Arthur Miller and
novelist William Styron, who met Cuba's top writers.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful-looking Prieto, wearing black jeans and a simple
cotton shirt, was not what the US group expected in a high-ranking
Communist Party official. By some accounts, Prieto is one of a very
few known to have disagreed and even argued in public with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro. A noted novelist and short story writer who
organized writers and artists against government crackdowns in the
mid-1990s, Prieto became minister in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was surprise that Prieto was picked as culture minister.
He has quietly pushed the envelope,'' said Geoff Thale, Cuba
specialist for the Washington Office on Latin American, the private
group that organized the educators' visit.
</P>
<P>
   During the Tuesday gathering at the Ministry of Culture's grand
colonial mansion, the presidents of Lesley College, the
Massachusetts College of Art, and other colleges with art and
writing programs asked Prieto to help them organize a traveling
exhibit of Cuban painting and art, and perhaps even consider
sending an artist, writer, or poet to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send a curator to choose what you want to display,'' Prieto
told Massachusetts College of Art President Katherine Sloan, who
stressed that she wanted to know about Cuban artists not known in
the US. ``There is much interesting work from the various
generations. We would support that one hundred percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Prieto said cultural ties, more than others, would help break
down stereotypes on both sides. He said Cubans adore American
movies, have read Mark Twain and Gore Vidal, and love actors Harry
Belafonte, Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, and Leonardo DiCaprio,
all of whom have visited here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholson knows well the history of Cuba. DeCaprio came full
of innocence,'' Prieto said to much laughter. ``But both caused an
interesting chemistry here.''

   LA-BUSINESS (Los Angeles) _ So much for Mayor Riordan's vow to
make the city more business friendly. Somebody goofed in Los
Angeles City Hall and the city mailed 11,000 erroneous notices to
business owners, mistakenly chastising them for not paying their
business license fees. By Alexa Haussler. (Will move in the ``a''

boilerplate language, hurting efforts to free more people. By Beth
Barrett and Greg Gittrich. (Will move in the ``a'' national and the

   CENSUS-FOLLOW (Washington) _ A week from today, census workers
will start knocking on doors at homes that did not return their
census questionnaires. Now that phase-one of the census has ended,
the U.S. Census Bureau will release figures Thursday showing the
``initial response rate'' in each city, county and state. Burbank
is among a small handful of cities that improved their response
rate by 5 percent or more, compared with a decade ago. Los Angeles
was up 1 percent. California improved by 2 percent, a notable
turnaround because the state's rate kept falling in previous
decades. By Bill Hillburg. (Will move in the ``a'' national and the

MCCAIN SAYS PRINCIPAL DEMANDED HE CORRECT FLAG STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Two months after he lost a key primary in this
state, his candidacy a fading memory to most here, Senator John
McCain apologized Wednesday for betraying what he called the single
most important principle of his bid for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkably self-critical speech, Senator John McCain said
he had not spoken his true feelings during the campaign when asked
his personal view of the Confederate battle flag flying over the
state house here. He did not tell reporters at the time that he
believes Confederate soldiers ``fought on the wrong side of
American history'' and that the flag should be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered those omissions ``unprincipled,'' and that
he fully deserves the criticism that he expects to rain down upon
him because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The lapse has so eaten away at the senator, aides said, that he
journeyed all the way back to South Carolina, for the first time
since his drubbing in the Feb. 19 primary, to make his act of
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win in the
South Carolina primary. So, I chose to compromise my principles. I
broke my promise to always tell the truth,'' he told members of the
South Carolina Policy Council here.
</P>
<P>
   While some of McCain's supporters here saw McCain's mea culpa as
a testament to his character and integrity, others were incensed by
what they saw as a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He abused, misled, and lied to the people of South Carolina in
order to accomplish a political goal,'' said state legislator Jake
Knotts, who was a member of McCain's steering committee. ``I'm
ashamed of the fact that I took him at his word, and took him
around this state, portraying him as the new horizon in politics,
and then he betrayed the people just like he did.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's rejoinder? Knotts, he said, ``has every right to feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign in South Carolina, McCain tried to avoid
being drawn into the acrimonious dispute over the Confederate flag.
At various times, he said he understood each side of the debate,
that conservative voters might see the flag as a symbol of
heritage, and that minority residents would see it as a symbol of
racism and slavery, but that he thought the matter best left to the
people of South Carolina to decide.
</P>
<P>
   He often cited the fact that his own ancestors had fought as
Confederate soldiers, and that their service was honorable and
should be recognized. Wednesday, however, he said his view of his
forbears was more complicated than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe their service, however distinguished, needs to
be commemorated in a way that offends, that deeply hurts, people
whose ancestors were once denied their freedom by my ancestors,''
he said. ``They fought to sever the union of our great nation, a
cause that would have terribly harmed America, perhaps irreparably,
and, for a time at least, perpetuated the grave injustice of
slavery. . . . That, my friends, is how I personally feel about the
Confederate battle flag. That is the honest answer I never gave to
a fair question.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added that he thought the flag should be removed from the
capitol, but that he also was encouraged the state seemed to be
resolving the situation for itself. Last week, the state senate
voted to take the flag down from statehouse dome, and to move it to
a nearby Confederate soldiers' monument. The NAACP, which began an
economic boycott of the state at the height of the controversy,
opposes the relocation, arguing the new location will make the flag
even more prominent than it is now. Black and conservative
legislators in the House of Representatives say they may also
oppose the relocation, though for opposing reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's apology was extraordinary by modern political
standards, but not out of character for McCain. The senator has
taken many a trip to the public confessional. He has apologized
repeatedly for his role in the Keating Five influence-peddling
scandal, for example, and for allowing the South Carolina contest
to degenerate to a level which disillusioned a young Spartanburg
boy. Throughout the campaign, he often said the cynicism young
people feel about national politics ``shames me.''
</P>
<P>
   But even by McCain's standards, this was a spectacular act of
contrition. He did not seek forgiveness, he said. His only
objective was confession, and he expected to be punished. He even
started the recriminations himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be criticized by all sides for my late act of
contrition,'' he said. ``I accept it, all of it. I deserve it.
Honesty is easy after the fact, when my own interests are no longer
involved. I don't seek absolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He added his hope that, ``in the end, my character is judged by
the totality of my life, and not by its flaws alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quinn, one of McCain's South Carolina advisers and a
founder of the conservative Southern Partisan magazine, said he
thought McCain had been far too hard on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he said (during the campaign) was factual,'' Quinn
said. ``When he was asked `How do you feel personally?' he held
back. I think he was harsh on himself to say that was dishonest. He
was just not forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easy for him to just stay out of it, but he
came back, so I have a lot of respect for him,'' said Vince Ellis,
a Republican candidate for Congress who is African American. But
Ellis conceded it would sent an even more powerful message if
McCain had risked such complete honesty during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have made it easier for minorities to be comfortable
with this party if he had done that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knotts was less forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd lie on the campaign trail, then he's no better than
Bill Clinton,'' the legislator said. ``He'd lie in Washington or in
the White House.'' Still, he said, he would probably have supported
McCain even if he'd known his true views on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Sinclair, one of several men who waved huge Confederate
flags outside the meeting, as motorists in pick-ups honked and
hollered their support for the stars and bars, said McCain's
comments were ``a disgrace. If he is running for office he needs to
be honest up front and tell people what he believes, and if he
doesn't have convictions, he doesn't need to be in public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who defeated McCain for the
nomination, has stuck to his view that the flag controversy is a
state matter, even in the face of McCain's reversal. The campaign
of Vice President and apparent Democratic nominee Al Gore Wednesday
tried to capitalize on McCain's speech by calling upon Bush to
clearly state his honest personal opinion on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vehemently denied that his mea culpa had anything to do
with his erstwhile rival, or was meant to put pressure on Bush, who
has been trying of late to regain the trust of more moderate
voters. Several of McCain's former supporters have argued Bush can
capture moderate voters by inviting McCain to be his running mate,
and Bush recently said he had not ruled the Arizona Senator out.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long been trying to head off the vice presidential
speculation. Asked whether he would consider becoming Bush's
nominee for Vice President, McCain gave an unambiguous reply
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in being Vice President. I believe I can
serve the country better in the US Senate,'' he said. ``I do not
seek and do not want to be considered for Vice President of the
United States. I would categorically state to Governor Bush...that
I do not wish to be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are due to meet to try to patch up the wounds of the
primary campaign in Pittsburgh on May 9th. An aide to McCain said
he thought the senator would be unlikely to endorse the governor at
that meeting, though a subsequent endorsement is probable.

&HT;     A SMALL BOY HAS REPLACED MISSILES AS THE SYMBOL OF U.S.-CUBAN
RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long ago when the elegant, young John F. Kennedy
was president, the symbol of U. S.-Cuban relations was an array of
Soviet-made missiles capable of firing deadly nuclear warheads into
our country.
</P>
<P>
   That was 38 years ago. Since then, we have witnessed dramatic
changes, including a remarkable switch in the symbol. Now it is a
six-year-old boy named Elian Gonzalez, whose custody has triggered
a bitter dispute between Cubans living in Miami and those in Fidel
Castro's island domain.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1962, the Cold War was hot, the Soviet Union was run
by the bombastic Nikita Khrushchev, and nuclear confrontation was a
constant threat to a tenuous peace. In an effort to project Soviet
military power into the Western Hemisphere, Khrushchev had secretly
ordered the shipment of offensive ballistic missiles to Cuba, where
launching pads were being constructed.
</P>
<P>
   When American U-2 spy planes confirmed Khrushchev's provocative
deception, Kennedy ordered a quarantine of Cuba. He also demanded a
halt in the shipment and installation of the missiles, which posed
a perilous threat to the United States and other Western Hemisphere
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly four decades later, relations between Washington
and Havana remain prickly, and Castro is celebrating his 41st year
as Cuba's dictator. At the same time, the United States is
preparing to elect its 10th president since Castro seized power in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He has stage-managed efforts to return Elian to his father and
then to Cuba, while Elian's relatives in Miami have fought to
obtain custody of the boy. Elian was plucked from frigid waters off
the Florida coast last November after the boat carrying him and his
mother to this country capsized.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between America and the Soviet Union in 1962
propelled the world closer to nuclear war than it ever has been. No
one, including Kennedy and his top advisers, knew how far
Khrushchev would go to gain a military foothold just 90 miles from
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Had the conflict reached the point of a probable nuclear
exchange, the president and his national security team were to fly
to a heavily-fortified underground command post in the Blue Ridge
mountains of Virginia, and we who covered the White House on a
regular basis were to go with him.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I packed the trunk of our car with canned food,
blankets and water. If I was able to get advance word to her that
Soviet missiles might soon be headed our way, she and our two
children were ready to drive into Virginia to stay with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 22, 1962, a somber Kennedy told the American people in a
televised speech, ``My fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this
is a difficult and dangerous effort. No one can foresee precisely
what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be
incurred. But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing.
Our goal is not victory of might, but the vindication of right _
not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom,
here in this hemisphere and, we hope, around the world. God
willing, that goal will be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also warned Moscow that ``it shall be the policy
of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba
against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the
Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The desperate interlude finally ended when Khrushchev sent two
conflicting letters to the White House and Kennedy chose to answer
only the one that was reasonable and offered a way out of the
missile crisis. As a result, ships heading for Cuba loaded with
Soviet missiles turned around and sailed back to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   This year there is no threat of war over the actions of Fidel
Castro. The Soviet Union, which had bankrolled him, broke apart
when the Cold War ended. And Moscow's financial and military
support of Castro presumably ended shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle over the fate of little Elian recalls the many
troubles America has had with Castro since he claimed absolute
leadership over Cuba in 1959. The Dwight Eisenhower administration
in Washington was pleased at that time to see the departure of
Cuba's dictator, Fulgencio Batista, described by Ike's biographer,
Stephen Ambrose, as ``corrupt and reactionary.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ambrose wrote, the tall, bearded Castro was
``young, romantic, dynamic and full of promises about free
elections, social reform, new schools and economic justice.''
Eisenhower, therefore, extended full diplomatic recognition to the
Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   But early in 1960, Ambrose continued, it became apparent that
Castro's regime was becoming ``a complete communist dictatorship.''
The CIA began training and arming a force of 1,400 exiled Cubans to
prepare for an invasion to overthrow Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had been in the White House a mere three months when the
invasion began at Cuba's Bay of Pigs in April, 1961. The new
president ruled out the commitment of U.S. troops to help the
rebels, and within three days of the landing, the invasion force
was decimated.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, some Americans decided
that although Lee Harvey Oswald pulled the trigger that killed
President, the evil force behind the plot was Castro. At the same
time, word circulated that Kennedy had approved an American plan to
kill Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Against such a background of conspiracy and violence it is
ironic that a tiny Spanish-speaking lad who knows nothing of past
or present world tensions should now emerge as the symbol of
U.S.-Cuban relations.

AFRIKANERS ARE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY LIFE UNDER THE MBEKI
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The telephone rang on his desk that workday
morning, and when Neil van Heerden snatched it up, the voice on the
line asked: Will you join some prominent businessmen in signing a
declaration of support for President Thabo Mbeki?
</P>
<P>
   For decades, van Heerden had worked as a diplomat for the
apartheid regime. He is a proud Afrikaner, who speaks eloquently
about the dislocation and depression his people felt after they
finally surrendered power to a black government six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also a practical man who has learned to adapt. So when
the call came from a friend two months ago, he did not hesitate.
With a flourish, he joined more than 30 Afrikaner business leaders
who praised the president's ``vision and leadership'' and landed on
the front pages of South African newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If that's what you want to say, I'm with you,''' said
van Heerden, who now runs the South Africa Foundation, an
association of more than 40 of the country's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected pat on the back for Mbeki is a reflection of one
of the more surprising shifts in the economic landscape here since
the end of apartheid: the growing confidence and increased
prosperity of wealthy Afrikaners under black rule.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Afrikaners, descendants of 17th-century Dutch,
German and French settlers, invented the brutal system of total
racial segregation known as apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But when government finally changed hands, many Afrikaners
decided to stay put. After more than 300 years in South Africa,
most had nowhere else to go. By contrast, a sizable number of
English-speaking descendants of British colonialists _ who were
less numerous than the Afrikaners but controlled much of the
economy under apartheid _ did leave, enabling Afrikaners to fill
the gaps. Though emigration statistics are not broken down by
ethnic group, the exodus of English-speaking whites has been
perceptible in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1999, Afrikaner businessmen saw their share of
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange surge from 24 percent to 36 percent
as they snapped up companies shed by emigrating firms and began
dominating the growing technology and electronics sectors,
according to a new study by Robin McGregor, a prominent analyst who
has tracked several decades of corporate ownership.
</P>
<P>
   And many Afrikaner businessmen, who once viewed a black
government with suspicion, now believe their economic prospects
will only improve under Mbeki, who is taming the deficit and
reducing taxes, and has promised to relax tough labor laws and
speed the privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, which stood at 12.5 percent in 1994, dipped to 5.2
percent last year. And the economy, which grew by only 1 percent in
1999, is expected to grow by at least 6 percent during the next two
years. In February, the credit rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's
upgraded South Africa's debt rating to investment grade, noting
that Mbeki's administration ``had stepped up the pace of structural
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the business magazine, Financial Mail, recently wrote
about the nation's black president, the black Reserve Bank chairman
and the black finance minister under the headline, ``We've Never
Had It So Good,'' many Afrikaner businessmen found themselves
nodding their heads in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What has impressed me is Mbeki's uncompromising pursuit of
these economic goals, which is extremely important for this
country,'' said Paul Kruger, the chairman of Sasol, the country's
largest fuel and chemicals company. ``I just believe one should
give credit where credit is due.
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't to say that I'm going to vote for this
government,'' added Kruger, who was a proud and long-time member of
the National Party, the Afrikaner-based party that
institutionalized apartheid. ``This doesn't mean joining the ANC.
But this government is on the right track. I am positive about the
future. And I wanted to get that message of hope across,
particularly to Afrikaans-speaking people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of news that left Mbeki's supporters jumping
with glee and his critics grumbling about publicity stunts.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, it was a moment of sweet vindication, a
chance to proclaim that those who had assumed that Mbeki would
alienate whites were just plumb wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be Nelson Mandela, the great reconciler. But his
supporters say he is a leader who delivers, a man who wins hearts
and minds with smart and practical policy.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mbeki does not need Afrikaners to win elections _ they
are only about 7 percent of the population _ the endorsement from
their business leaders may help him win greater credibility abroad
at a time when his government is actively seeking foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If bankers and captains of industry believe Mbeki is the right
man for the job, why should the others not believe?'' asked Parks
Mankahlana, the spokesman for Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   But some Afrikaners are quick to accuse rich Afrikaner
businessmen like Kruger; G.T. Ferreira, chairman of FirstRand, the
financial services giant; and Christo Wiese, chairman of Pepkor, a
retailing company, of simply trying to curry favor with a black
government.
</P>
<P>
   Such wealthy people, these critics say, have lost touch with
ordinary whites who distrust a government that aggressively
promotes affirmative action but has had a hard time battling crime.
Certainly the percentage of whites that support the government
remains small.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Human Sciences Research Council found that
11 percent of whites surveyed in November 1999 were satisfied with
national government. That is up from 6 percent the previous year,
but it is still no ringing endorsement of black rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rich people sit on the top of the mountain and say to
the average Afrikaner, `It's OK here. It's nice here,' but that is
definitely not the feeling we have from the people on the ground,''
said Dirk Hermann, the spokesman for the Mine Workers' Union, which
represents 65,000 Afrikaners in mining, telecommunications and
electrical engineering. ``Most Afrikaners are alienated by this
government's policies.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the gesture by the Afrikaner businessmen, small as it may
be, is one of a number of recent examples of whites and blacks
reaching tentatively across the racial divide.
</P>
<P>
   In January, for instance, Roelof F. Botha, the long-serving
foreign minister for the apartheid regime, stunned the nation when
he announced plans to join the governing party, the African
National Congress, and urged other whites to do the same. ANC
officials say Botha now holds an ANC membership card. In February,
the Democratic Party, which has become the pre-eminent party among
whites in this country, announced that its leaders would start
visiting townships and squatter camps as part of a five-year
campaign to win the hearts of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, for the first time ever, the youth leagues of the
most influential Afrikaner and black organizations _ the
Afrikanerbond and the African National Congress _ will hold a joint
conference to focus on building trust and unity among the next
generation of leaders. The Afrikanerbond is the post-apartheid
incarnation of the Broederbond, the powerful secret society that
advanced Afrikaner interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two worlds meeting,'' said Jan du Plooy, president of the
Afrikanerbond Youth League, who admits he was astonished when the
ANC sent an invitation for a meeting late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to look forward,'' said du Plooy, who is also a
lieutenant colonel in the South African National Defense Force.
``We're trying to focus on commonalities. We want to get away from
just being a Zulu, a Xhosa or an Afrikaner. What is it to be a
South African?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the ANC youth league say Mbeki suggested the
rapprochement between the two organizations. It was Mbeki, after
all, who initiated some of the first contacts between black exiles
and white businessmen in the 1980s, before the end of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Mbeki's old friend from those days, Professor Willie
Esterhuyse of the University of Stellenbosch, who rallied support
in the business community for the recent declaration.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense among many blacks here that Afrikaners, despite
their history of racial intolerance, are more committed to this
country than English-speaking whites. And since his election to the
presidency last year, Mbeki has continued to woo this constituency.
</P>
<P>
   He has addressed Afrikaner organizations in speeches peppered
with verses of Afrikaans poetry, has promised to protect their
language and, more recently, has agreed to consider amending the
law to allow for the continued existence of Orania, a white
homeland, which is scheduled to merge with a nearby black town.
</P>
<P>
   Some people dismiss these actions as smart politicking, not
genuine sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But in this polarized society, where the sturdy walls of race
still divide much of the country, even polite, self-interested
gestures across the color line still make for front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concerted effort to reassure Afrikaners, and that's
certainly significant,'' said J.P. Landman, the editor of Finance
Week, a business weekly which is published in Afrikaans and in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks through the traditional pattern of animosity between
the ANC and the Afrikaans-speaking community,'' Landman said. ``My
sense is that the government has taken a decision somewhere in the
recent past to build more bridges between themselves and the
Afrikaners.'' By signing the declaration, several businessmen said
they had hoped to build bridges, too. They said they wanted to show
other Afrikaners that they had overcome their fears, even though
the transition was not an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   Van Heerden, who served as a diplomat in Brussels for two years
under Mandela, vividly describes the struggle to adjust to the new
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there was a sense of loss, of
confusion, of fear of the future,'' said van Heerden, as he
pondered the psychological impact of the power shift one recent
morning in his office here. ``Suddenly, I'm being ruled by my
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe since 1994, the Afrikaner has taken stock,'' he
said. ``He has sort of caught his breath. He says, `Here I am. I'm
still alive. I still have my house and my car and the heavens
haven't fallen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looked at the quality of the people who are now his
rulers, and he's beginning to say, `Although we have black
empowerment and affirmative action, I can find standing room in
this country,''' van Heerden said. ``I think that is what Mbeki is
saying, too. There is room for all of us.''

FIBER NO COLON CANCER PREVENTATIVE, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been wolfing down a pile of high-fiber bran flakes or
other cereal every day in hopes of avoiding colon cancer,
researchers have two words for you: Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of studies found no benefit of a low-fat, high-fiber diet
in preventing precancerous growths called polyps that sometimes are
forerunners of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said they were surprised and disappointed to find no
evidence supporting the long-held notion that such diets can reduce
the risk of colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The studies recruited patients who were at higher than normal
risk for colon cancer because of already having had an intestinal
polyp removed. Results showed that the supposedly protective diet
failed to reduce their risk of having another polyp develop in
their colons.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat: The researchers followed the volunteers for three or
four years, and it may be necessary to adhere to such a diet for a
longer time to show an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the scientists don't recommend shunning dietary fiber and
start gorging on burgers and fries. The researchers emphasize that
fiber does help reduce risks of heart disease, and eating more
fruits and vegetables and cutting back on fat is associated with
better health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean you should throw away your bran flakes,''
said Walter Willett, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of
Public Health. The notion that a high-fiber diet reduced colon
cancer risk stems from observations that people in developing
countries in Africa, who eat more grains and fruits than in the
West, have little colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that fiber itself was protective, by absorbing
cancer-causing substances in the bowel or by hastening their
excretion, was ``compelling and simple'' but apparently wrong, said
Willett. He was not involved in the studies, but was an author on a
report last year from the Boston-based Women's Health Study that
had similar findings on fiber, fat, and colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The reports in the current New England Journal of Medicine are
from the Polyp Prevention Trial Study Group headed by Dr. Arthur
Schatzkin of the National Cancer Institute, and the Wheat Bran
Fiber Study, led by Dr. David S. Alberts at the Arizona Cancer
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Colon and rectal cancer strikes about 130,000 Americans annually
and causes 56,500 deaths. The disease begins as abnormal cells in
the wall of the large intestine, which develop into polyps: about 5
to 10 percent of polyps become cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   The trials are the biggest to date in which volunteers were
randomly assigned to follow a low-fat, high-fiber diet or to eat
their usual range of foods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Polyp Prevention Trial, 2,079 men and women averaging 61
years old at the start of the study were randomized into a diet
group and a control group. The subjects had all had a colon polyp
recently removed. The diet group had intensive counseling on
achieving the goal of eating only 20 percent of calories from fat
and 18 grams of fiber and 3 1/2 servings of fruits and vegetables
for every 1,000 calories eaten.
</P>
<P>
   All the volunteers underwent colonoscopies 1 and 4 years after
the study began. At the end of the trial, there was virtually no
difference in the number of people who developed recurrent polyps
and those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say I'm disappointed,'' said Schatzkin of the
cancer institute. ``We carried out the trial because we thought it
had a real good chance of showing a difference'' between the diet
and the control group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Zeisel, a professor of nutrition at University of
North Carolina School of Medicine said the study's short follow-up
time limit its strength. Cancer development is a long process, he
said, and ``the key events may have occurred before the dietary
change was made, and it was too late to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although advertisements for high-fiber breakfast cereals have
created the impression they could prevent colon cancer, the actual
labeling on the products approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration is unlikely to change.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Kellog's in Battle Creek, Mich., said the
current labeling says: ``Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing
grain products, fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of
certain cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Byers of the University of Colorado School of Medicine
said in an editorial accompanying the reports, wrote that there are
many reasons to eat low-fat, high-fiber diets, ``but preventing
colorectal adenomas (polyps) is not one of them.''

EPPS CALLS HIS SHOTS IN `LOVE &AMP; BASKETBALL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Omar Epps got his start in movies when most films
about black people concerned urban violence, from ``Menace II
Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood'' to his own debut at 18 in 1992's
``Juice.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's happy to have grown along with the movies.
</P>
<P>
   His latest film, ``Love &AMP; Basketball,'' which opens Friday, is a
romance about two kids from affluent families (Epps and Sanaa
Lathan) who mature and fall in love while sharing a love of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad (black films) are changing,'' Epps, 26, said during a
recent visit to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, whatever's making money, that's the films they'll
be making. But lately films like `The Best Man' and `The Wood' (in
which Epps also starred) are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like those movies, ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' has humor and heart, as
the kids (first played by child actors) grow into adults who become
serious about basketball but also each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is two-thirds love and one-third basketball,'' said
Epps, who trained for two months with coaches at UCLA after
director-writer Gina Prince cast him.
</P>
<P>
   Epps, who's 5 feet 10 and plays guard, had played basketball
while growing up in Brooklyn, N.Y., where he still spends time with
his family when he's not in Los Angeles, where he moved three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But his ``playground ball'' was insufficient for portraying
Quincy, who becomes a star in college and goes on to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to learn disciplined ball, organized ball, but that was
fun,'' he said. ``I've got some moves I never had _ a nice little
jumper. When we wrapped I was blazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But last week when I shot the ball again, I said, `Well, I
guess that movie is over.' I hadn't played for two months, and now
I'm back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps also has starred in a football movie, ``The Program,'' as
well as a baseball film, ``Major League II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit athletic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There, his steadily ringing cell phone signaled how busy Epps
has become.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``The Wood,'' he's also appeared recently in ``Breakfast
of Champions,'' ``In Too Deep,'' ``Scream 2'' and ``The Mod
Squad.'' Next up is ``Brother,'' about Japanese gangsters known as
``yakuza.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Epps starred for one season on ``ER,''
playing Dr. Dennis Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Although he declines TV offers now, ``That was big for me,'' he
said. ``It introduced me to the mainstream. I was in 40.7 million
people's living rooms across the country, and that ain't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   His career path began with studies. Epps is a graduate of New
York's High School for the Performing Arts, the setting for 1980's
``Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   While the school's real students don't necessarily enact musical
numbers in the cafeteria, Epps said the school ``was wild and
interesting. It was like a microcosm of New York _ like the
Internet but in human form.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``Fame''-school graduate is getting parts written
especially for him. Prince wrote her script with Epps in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time that's happened,'' he said. ``That's
definitely flattering _ another mark in my career that I'll look
back on. It's a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of ``Love &AMP; Basketball's'' producers was filmmaker Spike
Lee. But though Lee put his weight behind the production, he didn't
interfere with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike was like a big brother,'' Epps said. ``He helped get the
film rolling and then left it alone so Gina could do her thing. I
think he only came to the set (in L.A.) one time.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' has ``tested really well'' in advance
screenings, Epps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies don't have to have an alien or a gun,'' he said. ``They
just need to tell a story that people like. In this one you see the
characters grow and learn what it means to love one person. I think
it is eloquently done.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps is pleased that Prince didn't hammer home a feminist
message, although the film concerns inequities in pro basketball
before the WNBA's emergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want to use the film as a podium to make a
statement about women's athletics,'' Epps said. ``It's a love
story. It's not preachy, and I like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you do see how women had to go overseas to be pros, like
Coop did,'' Epps said, referring to the Houston Comets' Cynthia
Cooper, whom he admiringly calls ``the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps' and Lathan's characters are depicted as virtual equals on
the court, as shown when they compete one-on-one. (Lathan also has
starred in ``Blade,'' ``The Wood'' and ``The Best Man.'')
</P>
<P>
   But those games were just role-playing, Epps said when asked
who's the better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come on. She'd never played basketball _ ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will say this: When they were casting her part, Sanaa
was the best actress in the room, hands down. She did a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing his hoops skills wasn't Epps' first priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern in doing a sports film,'' he said, ``is that I
can't get hurt.'' (Films can lose millions in lost production time
if a star is injured.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the basketball scenes, I only gave about 40 percent and let
the camera do the rest,'' Epps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thought was, `I can't get injured.' There is no `what
if?' And in basketball, there are so many ways you can get
injured.''
</P>

   Epps did not get hurt, but problems arose in other ways. Some of
his opponents on the screen were recruited from college ranks or
the fringes of pro basketball. Those guys had something to prove,
regardless of a scene's demands.

   ``They were playing hard,'' Epps said with a laugh. ``We had to
keep saying, `Hey, it's a movie. No matter what you do, I'm
supposed to make the shot.'''

TENSION AND MISTRUST BUILD AT BRITISH NUCLEAR COMPLEX

 By ALAN COWELL c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  SELLAFIELD, England _ When John Storer took over a new
high-profile job at Britain's most dispute-ridden nuclear complex
in September, he expected ``a fairly steep learning curve.''
Instead, he said, ``World War III started shortly afterward.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Storer,  &UR; a  &LR; 40-year-old engineer &UR; , &LR;  settled into his
position overseeing a troubled nuclear fuel reprocessing unit, he
was told that workers had falsified documents involving fuel rods
even then in transit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The implications were not lost on Storer. It was the first
shipment of such fuel rods to Japan _ a crucial customer of British
Nuclear Fuels, the government-owned company that operates the
sprawling Sellafield complex. The discovery, moreover, coincided
with efforts by the company to secure government approval for
plutonium processing at a gleaming new unit here designed to turn
out ``mixed oxide'' fuel _ a blend of uranium and plutonium. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``The timing was a disaster,'' Storer said in an interview.
``And worse still, it was self-inflicted. We had shot ourselves in
the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, things turned out far worse than he had imagined,
causing the equivalent of a commercial meltdown at this complex on
England's wild northwestern coast, which has been a cauldron of
environmental, commercial and social tension ever since the opening
of the first unit, a nuclear power station, here in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to rebuild its reputation, British Nuclear on
Tuesday announced a leadership shake-up, promised an overhaul of
safety procedures and said it had embarked on measures to prevent a
recurrence of the falsification of documents. It also said it would
streamline Sellafield's management to introduce greater
accountability and to unify myriad safety and management practices.
Government inspectors said they would watch the company closely to
make sure it followed through.
</P>
<P>
   The falsification of documents, by some accounts to cut corners,
was only the opening chapter in a chronicle of woes that has
hammered the company's standing in much of Europe, Japan and the
United States, and it is fighting to hold on to an estimated $9
billion worth of contracts to dismantle and clean up nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the crisis has started a debate about just what business
the company should be in _ reprocessing spent fuel for use in power
plants, or disposing of nuclear waste and cleaning up nuclear
sites, a business that some analysts say has huge potential,
without the controversies associated with reprocessing. There is no
easy answer. If the reprocessing unit is closed, there will be no
raw materials to produce mixed oxide fuel, leaving the Sellafield
complex with little but its nuclear waste storage operations and an
aging nuclear power station. That would cost thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company and the British government remain formally
committed to reprocessing, Hugh Collum, chairman of the company,
hinted that change might be inevitable. ``We must be in a position
to consider the unthinkable,'' he told a parliamentary panel in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the debate has spread across Europe to the whole
business of selling mixed-oxide fuels, which are more expensive
than uranium but which enable plant operators to re-use spent fuel
without buying new uranium. Germany, which also says it received
shipments from Sellafield with falsified documents, has raised
concerns about ``irregularities'' in reprocessed fuel, known as
MOX, from France.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of mistrust, the environmental group Greenpeace
said recently that MOX from Belgium, France and Britain ``cannot be
guaranteed safe to use.'' And in southern England, a group of
dignitaries from the Channel Island of Jersey plan to travel to
France to press for the end of reprocessing at a government-owned
plant at La Hague on the French coast that is Sellafield's main
rival in MOX production. In the United States, reprocessing has
been banned since the administration of Jimmy Carter, and British
Nuclear's only other competitor is in Belgium. Germany, Switzerland
and Sweden have suspended shipments of spent fuel that was to be
reprocessed at Sellafield. Japan wants the company to take back the
fuel it shipped there.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is surprising considering the catalog of problems
at Sellafield. After the falsification debacle, a routine inquiry
by government inspectors discovered ``systematic management
failures.'' Those conclusions were published in February. In
mid-March, the company acknowledged that a saboteur had severed six
cables on a robotic arm in a nuclear waste disposal unit. At the
end of March, Ireland and Denmark revived a long-running campaign
against the company's environmental record on radioactive pollution
of the atmosphere and of the Irish Sea, demanding the closing of
the six-year-old, $2.88 billion Thorp plant _ the spent-fuel
reprocessing part of the Sellafield complex.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the British government has postponed a plan to
sell off 49 percent of the company, raising further questions about
the opaque financial underpinnings of the reprocessing business.
</P>
<P>
   And in this region, caught by history and geography between a
long-gone industrial past and an uncertain nuclear future, between
the slate-gray wash of the Irish Sea and the soaring majesty of
England's Lake District, the fate of Sellafield's 10,000 jobs has
become the single greatest topic of debate in pubs and stores and
cafes and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's business around here is a spin-off from
Sellafield,'' said Elvina Quayle, 53, who sells cut flowers and
groceries from a modest store in Egremont, an old market town just
north of Sellafield, and whose husband, Alan, has worked at the
Sellafield complex for 38 years. ``Sellafield has bought luxury for
everybody in this area,'' she said. ``If it's forced to close,
it'll kill off the region.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Indeed, said Irene Banks, 43, who serves tea and sandwiches at
the Apple Tree cafe in Egremont, ``we are just in denial here,
trying to pretend none of this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After a partial tour of the complex, though, it seemed clear
that the troubles stemmed from a blend of high-level, long-range
management decisions and low morale among some of the same workers
whose livelihood depends not just on the way the complex functions
but also on the way customers and critics see its record.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, critics point out, Sellafield's ultramodern $480
million MOX unit was commissioned and built before the government
gave approvals for it to handle uranium or plutonium. John Barbour,
a British Nuclear spokesman, said that was because ``there's no
mechanism'' to win the approvals before a plant is built. Yet the
company took orders to deliver MOX that it was producing at a far
less sophisticated demonstration unit that can turn out eight tons
of MOX a year and began operating in 1994. The new plant,
reflecting an assessment of likely demand, has a 100-ton annual
capacity, but even with an array of computerized controls it has
yet to start operating.
</P>
<P>
   A Sellafield spokesman, Nigel Monckton, projected profits of
$480 million over the plant's life span. He did not say what the
life span was expected to be, but other reports have put it at 20
years. It was in the older, smaller plant, where data are punched
manually into computer terminals along the production route, that
the falsification took place. Workers called up a spreadsheet
accompanying an old order, Storer said, and simply punched in a new
batch number.
</P>
<P>
   The incident raised questions about the ties between workers and
overseers. ``Clearly there was commercial pressure'' to meet
customers' demands, said John Cane, a union representative. But
``that plant was never designed to be a commercial facility,'' he
said, despite the company's insistence that the older plant had
been designed with some commercial use in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the customer, Kansai Electric Power, had demanded
an additional check on the fuel pellets being produced. Normally,
Storer said, clients were satisfied with three checking procedures.
The fourth involved a random manual sampling of the diameters of 5
percent of the pellets, a crucial measure because the pellets must
fit precisely into a fuel cell's long, slender tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The workers who were supposed to undertake those checks, Cane
said, ``had difficulty understanding the relevance of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior managers, too, acknowledge problems relating to the
demonstration unit, where work has been suspended since September.
``It was a prototype, but it was designed to produce a certain
amount,'' said Jeremy Rycroft, a British Nuclear executive.
``Things weren't designed as ergonomically as at the new plant. It
was a small-scale facility. But things should have been right.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the more recent case of sabotage, Cane said, the
suspects in the severing of robotic cables seem to have borne
grievances against the company over issues like a new pension and
work contract negotiated with the union. A report by Britain's
nuclear installations inspections agency found fault with
Sellafield's entire ``safety culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear reprocessing, which takes spent fuel from reactors and
turns it into reusable uranium and much smaller amounts of
plutonium, is a long-range business. When the Thorp plant opened in
1994, it boasted some $19 billion in contracts for the first 10
years of its life. In the deep, iridescent indoor ponds _ lined
with stainless steel _ huge, silvery casks of highly radioactive
spent fuel glimmer from far below the surface for as long as five
years until radiation levels begin to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Monckton said, the ponds contain some 2,800 tons of spent
fuel, a backlog that, at the current reprocessing rate, would take
three years to clear. But of course, if reprocessing was halted,
the raw materials for MOX production, uranium and plutonium, would
also come to an end. And MOX production was projected to earn $80
million in its first 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the company pretends that the crisis will be resolved
easily, permitting new contracts to be struck, particularly in
Japan, a key market that gave the complex a third of its initial
reprocessing orders in 1994. ``New business is an issue,'' said
Rycroft, the commercial director of the Thorp reprocessing
division. ``We won't win new business until we solve the issue of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics insist, however, that the issue is not simply confidence
but safety and overall strategy. Many have seized on Sellafield's
vulnerability to pursue long-running campaigns against emissions
levels from the plant's many nuclear processes, even though the
company says the emissions have fallen radically since the
mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mass hysteria,'' said Robin Simpson, a local Labor
politician who also works at Sellafield. ``Everyone is jumping on
the anti-Sellafield bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The reprocessing plant draws particular ire from environmental
campaigners because it produces its own highly radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want Sellafield closed,'' said Jill Perry, the local
representative of Friends of the Earth. ``But where we see its
future is in cleaning up nuclear waste, and that's where its
expertise should be focused.'' Indeed, she argued that halting the
reprocessing business that accounts for roughly half of
Sellafield's jobs could help the regional economy. ``No responsible
employer would open a factory or any other kind of business because
of the radioactivity in this area. So stopping reprocessing might
actually bring jobs.''

DECISION ON BOY PUTS PRESSURE ON RENO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I know where I'm going,'' Attorney General Janet
Reno said Wednesday morning, before a US appeals court appeared to
make the course she has chosen _ to reunite Elian Gonzalez with his
father, Juan Miguel _ that much harder to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department had banked on the appeals court
clearing Reno's path for removing the Cuban boy from the home of
his Miami relatives. Instead, in ruling that Elian can't
immediately leave the country, the judges in Atlanta seemed to
undermine Reno, the champion of the father's rights, and suggest
there may be merit to the Miami relatives' claim on the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court order does not preclude me from placing Elian in his
father's care while he is in the United States,'' Reno said late
Wednesday afternoon in Oklahoma City. ``We are going to consider
all our options, and take the course of action we deem appropriate,
under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   What will Reno do? Not even her aides know exactly where the
attorney general is heading or how she will accomplish her goal.
All along, the Gonzalez case has been her special cause. ``She
signs off on every detail. Nothing is too small for her,'' a
Justice Department spokeswoman said. ``She is up to her eyeballs in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Reno is likely to face a fresh round of criticism for
allowing the situation to smolder for so long that the Miamians and
their lawyers have won a new day in court. And she likely will be
chided for acting more like a social worker than attorney general
as she patiently, personally tried to mediate the custody case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the criticism of me is that I'm trying to avoid violence,
if the criticism of me is that I am trying to avoid that little boy
being hurt or being snatched in a way that can scar him further, I
plead guilty,'' Reno said. ``But at the same time...I am going to
enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, coincidentally, was the seventh anniversary of the
debacle at the Branch Davidian compound at Waco. Reno, under
pressure from the FBI and informed that children were being abused,
ordered a tank and tear-gas assault that left some 80 adults and
children dead in its fiery aftermath. The horror haunts Reno as she
ponders another rescue that involves child welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the American public is getting impatient with the
standoff over the six-year-old, and the White House has let Reno
know it is weary of watching the street scenes from Little Havana
on CNN. But Wednesday Reno defended her handling of Elian's case,
calling it ``unusual'' and noting it had none of the urgency of
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Waco, you had people who had killed federal officers, and
who had injured others,'' Reno said. ``You had people who had not
only defied the law but killed people in the process. There's a lot
of difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure should not be the issue; what's right should be the
issue,'' Reno added. ``Every day that goes by in which Elian is not
reunited with his father and this matter is not brought to a
conclusion, can be disruptive. No child should be in that kind of
never-never land for that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's compassion for children has not changed in the last seven
years, colleagues say. What the public is also seeing, aides say,
is a battle-scarred attorney general, trained in crisis management,
absorbed with doing the right thing, and tugged by her deep roots
in the Miami community.
</P>
<P>
   Her personal approach has tested Reno's authority and
credibility. She has comforted Elian's grandmothers, reassured
Elian's father, and taken the advice of Cuban-American entertainer
Gloria Estefan, who urged Reno to fly down and meet with the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The session last week was exhausting and a failure. According to
aides on hand, Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, lectured the
attorney general. Marisleysis, his daughter, wouldn't stop crying.
Elian kept running in and out of the room, and at one point bit the
arm of one of the psychologists present. Afterward, Reno held a
midnight news conference, said she would press on, and spent
another 30 minutes shaking hands and thanking Justice Department
staffers for their hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Krikorian, executive director of the private Center of
Immigration Studies and a frequent critic of White House policies,
says by letting deadlines slip for releasing the boy, the
government has probably emboldened the Miami relatives to make more
demands. But he gives Reno high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expected the administration would have caved in by
now,'' Krikorian said. ``I don't know why they are sticking to
their guns, but it could be Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's approval ratings soared after Waco because people liked
her ``buck-stops-here'' bluntness. But her indepedence has annoyed
some of the president's top aides and kept her out of the inner
circle, even though she is the longest-serving attorney general
since the Eisenhower administration. Republicans on Capitol Hill
have demanded her resignation for failing to appoint an independent
counsel to investigate Democratic fund-raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But no other case has stirred Reno quite like this one. She grew
up in Miami, where he father was a longtime police reporter, and
she served as the elected state's attorney in Dade County for 15
years. Friends say she understands the psychology, passions, and
patriotism of the people of Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno knows and respects that community, and to see it
perceived as a banana republic, and to hear people say, `What do
you expect from crazy Cubans,' must be very painful to her,'' said
Mary Coombs, a law professor at the University of Miami. ``She's
always assumed she would come back to where her roots are, and now
there may be people who don't want her here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno got her job as attorney general because two other women
named first were disqualified for child-care tax evasion. It's
ironic that Reno, who has called herself ``an awkward old maid,''
is the administration's premiere parent advocate in a high-profile
custody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Friends aren't surprised. As state's attorney, Reno stressed
that discipline starts with parents, and she made social work a
pre-eminent part of law enforcement. She earned the nickname ``Root
Cause Reno'' because she convened special grand juries to deal with
juvenile problems, including child abuse, and constantly was
probing family dysfunction for clues to criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Janet McAliley, a former member of the Dade County School Board
and a lifelong friend, remembers when Reno investigated the
corporal punishment case of a kindergartner and found that both
state law and local school boards permitted it. Alarmed, she
prodded officials until the law was changed and spanking rights
were banned in Dade county schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all Reno, caring enough about one little boy to get the
law changed,'' McAliley said. ``I think about her concern for this
child, Elian, and it is consistent with what she has tried to do
with so many, many other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno Wednesday refused to reply to a letter from Dr. Irwin
Redlener, a pediatrician-consultant, who advised the Justice
Department to remove Elian at once from what he called a
psychologically abusive home. But she said was disturbed by the
video, released by the Miami relatives, of Elian denouncing his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me very sad,'' Reno said softly. ``I have been
concerned that the boy has been separated from his father in a most
difficult situation, where it appears that he is not able to lead a
normal life, get sleep, go to school,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a wonderful little boy, by all accounts,'' the attorney
general told reporters. ``He has been under the most stressful
conditions, beginning with floating in the ocean. It is so
important that all of us turn off the TV lights, stop writing on
your papers, and start thinking about a little boy and getting his
life to some permanent resolution.''

MCCAIN SAYS PRINCIPLE DEMANDED HE CORRECT FLAG STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Two months after he lost a key primary in this
state, his candidacy a fading memory to most here, Senator John
McCain apologized Wednesday for betraying what he called the single
most important principle of his bid for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkably self-critical speech, Senator John McCain said
he had not spoken his true feelings during the campaign when asked
his personal view of the Confederate battle flag flying over the
state house here. He did not tell reporters at the time that he
believes Confederate soldiers ``fought on the wrong side of
American history'' and that the flag should be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered those omissions ``unprincipled,'' and that
he fully deserves the criticism that he expects to rain down upon
him because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The lapse has so eaten away at the senator, aides said, that he
journeyed all the way back to South Carolina, for the first time
since his drubbing in the Feb. 19 primary, to make his act of
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win in the
South Carolina primary. So, I chose to compromise my principles. I
broke my promise to always tell the truth,'' he told members of the
South Carolina Policy Council here.
</P>
<P>
   While some of McCain's supporters here saw McCain's mea culpa as
a testament to his character and integrity, others were incensed by
what they saw as a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He abused, misled, and lied to the people of South Carolina in
order to accomplish a political goal,'' said state legislator Jake
Knotts, who was a member of McCain's steering committee. ``I'm
ashamed of the fact that I took him at his word, and took him
around this state, portraying him as the new horizon in politics,
and then he betrayed the people just like he did.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's rejoinder? Knotts, he said, ``has every right to feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign in South Carolina, McCain tried to avoid
being drawn into the acrimonious dispute over the Confederate flag.
At various times, he said he understood each side of the debate,
that conservative voters might see the flag as a symbol of
heritage, and that minority residents would see it as a symbol of
racism and slavery, but that he thought the matter best left to the
people of South Carolina to decide.
</P>
<P>
   He often cited the fact that his own ancestors had fought as
Confederate soldiers, and that their service was honorable and
should be recognized. Wednesday, however, he said his view of his
forbears was more complicated than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe their service, however distinguished, needs to
be commemorated in a way that offends, that deeply hurts, people
whose ancestors were once denied their freedom by my ancestors,''
he said. ``They fought to sever the union of our great nation, a
cause that would have terribly harmed America, perhaps irreparably,
and, for a time at least, perpetuated the grave injustice of
slavery. . . . That, my friends, is how I personally feel about the
Confederate battle flag. That is the honest answer I never gave to
a fair question.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added that he thought the flag should be removed from the
capitol, but that he also was encouraged the state seemed to be
resolving the situation for itself. Last week, the state senate
voted to take the flag down from statehouse dome, and to move it to
a nearby Confederate soldiers' monument. The NAACP, which began an
economic boycott of the state at the height of the controversy,
opposes the relocation, arguing the new location will make the flag
even more prominent than it is now. Black and conservative
legislators in the House of Representatives say they may also
oppose the relocation, though for opposing reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's apology was extraordinary by modern political
standards, but not out of character for McCain. The senator has
taken many a trip to the public confessional. He has apologized
repeatedly for his role in the Keating Five influence-peddling
scandal, for example, and for allowing the South Carolina contest
to degenerate to a level which disillusioned a young Spartanburg
boy. Throughout the campaign, he often said the cynicism young
people feel about national politics ``shames me.''
</P>
<P>
   But even by McCain's standards, this was a spectacular act of
contrition. He did not seek forgiveness, he said. His only
objective was confession, and he expected to be punished. He even
started the recriminations himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be criticized by all sides for my late act of
contrition,'' he said. ``I accept it, all of it. I deserve it.
Honesty is easy after the fact, when my own interests are no longer
involved. I don't seek absolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He added his hope that, ``in the end, my character is judged by
the totality of my life, and not by its flaws alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quinn, one of McCain's South Carolina advisers and a
founder of the conservative Southern Partisan magazine, said he
thought McCain had been far too hard on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he said (during the campaign) was factual,'' Quinn
said. ``When he was asked `How do you feel personally?' he held
back. I think he was harsh on himself to say that was dishonest. He
was just not forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easy for him to just stay out of it, but he
came back, so I have a lot of respect for him,'' said Vince Ellis,
a Republican candidate for Congress who is African American. But
Ellis conceded it would sent an even more powerful message if
McCain had risked such complete honesty during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have made it easier for minorities to be comfortable
with this party if he had done that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knotts was less forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd lie on the campaign trail, then he's no better than
Bill Clinton,'' the legislator said. ``He'd lie in Washington or in
the White House.'' Still, he said, he would probably have supported
McCain even if he'd known his true views on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Sinclair, one of several men who waved huge Confederate
flags outside the meeting, as motorists in pick-ups honked and
hollered their support for the stars and bars, said McCain's
comments were ``a disgrace. If he is running for office he needs to
be honest up front and tell people what he believes, and if he
doesn't have convictions, he doesn't need to be in public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who defeated McCain for the
nomination, has stuck to his view that the flag controversy is a
state matter, even in the face of McCain's reversal. The campaign
of Vice President and apparent Democratic nominee Al Gore Wednesday
tried to capitalize on McCain's speech by calling upon Bush to
clearly state his honest personal opinion on the flag.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vehemently denied that his mea culpa had anything to do
with his erstwhile rival, or was meant to put pressure on Bush, who
has been trying of late to regain the trust of more moderate
voters. Several of McCain's former supporters have argued Bush can
capture moderate voters by inviting McCain to be his running mate,
and Bush recently said he had not ruled the Arizona Senator out.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long been trying to head off the vice presidential
speculation. Asked whether he would consider becoming Bush's
nominee for Vice President, McCain gave an unambiguous reply
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in being Vice President. I believe I can
serve the country better in the US Senate,'' he said. ``I do not
seek and do not want to be considered for Vice President of the
United States. I would categorically state to Governor Bush...that
I do not wish to be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are due to meet to try to patch up the wounds of the
primary campaign in Pittsburgh on May 9th. An aide to McCain said
he thought the senator would be unlikely to endorse the governor at
that meeting, though a subsequent endorsement is probable.

 &HT;    Jesse Jackson urges Coca-Cola to settle
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ While a group of former and current
African-American employees have called for a national boycott
against Coca-Cola, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other civil rights
leaders want to give the company more time to settle a racial
discrimination lawsuit before lending their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settle the suit,'' Jackson urged Coke Chairman Doug Daft and
top management as about 700 investors and two-dozen reporters
listened at the company's annual shareholders meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choose negotiation over confrontation. Choose resolution over
boycott. Change the culture,'' Jackson said. The president of
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition sees himself as a forceful figure capable of
bringing both sides in the suit together. He predicted a boycott
``will have a snowballing effect unless there is an honorable and
fair resolution right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and Georgia state
Rep. Tyrone Brooks also urged the company to settle the lawsuit
brought by eight former and current employees, but they didn't go
as far as endorsing a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials had hoped to avert the call for a boycott by
former employee Larry Jones, organizer of a ``bus ride for
justice'' to the shareholders meeting. Jones, a laid-off Coke human
resources manager, did not provide any details of his boycott
strategy. He also did not indicate how he would go about
marshalling support, especially since Jackson and others have
withheld theirs so far.
</P>
<P>
   But such a protest could get widespread media attention, hurting
the company's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed that some of the employees of the
company chose to call a boycott of the company in the midst of a
very difficult time,'' Carl Ware, executive vice president of
global public affairs, said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe there is any systemic, institutional
discrimination in the Coca-Cola Co.'' said Ware, the company's
highest-ranking black executive. ``Whenever we find discrimination,
we stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft, attending his first shareholders meeting as chairman, said
the company wants to be a leader in diversity, partly because it
makes good business sense, since the company operates in 200
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most diverse company in the world, no matter how
you define it,'' Daft told shareholders. ``We could always do
better. No one is perfect. We will be the company that leads the
world into a diverse business structure in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the nearly three-hour meeting, half of which was taken up
by discussions about diversity, Jackson took the company to task on
its employment record during the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke's board of directors must look like its consumer base,''
Jackson said. He pointed out, however, that there is no Hispanic on
the board, and only ``one black for 20 years.'' He was referring to
Donald McHenry, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson scolded the company for not replacing Ware with a black
executive when he left his previous job as head of Coke's African
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is the largest employer in Africa,'' Jackson said. ``Coke
has infrastructure, sugar planters, water plants, and yet no
African succeeded Carl Ware.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also told the company that it was getting poor legal
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who choose to deny, dance or delay a resolution (of the
lawsuit) are not serving you well,'' Jackson told Daft. ``Law bills
going up _ stock prices going down. ... They cannot win the case in
court. Coke will lose in the court of law, but worse, in the court
of public opinion, unless it seeks new sources of counsel and
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated
against African-American employees in pay, promotions and
performance evaluations. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action
status so they can represent 2,000 current and former employees in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A media circus followed the shareholders meeting, with Jackson
holding court in one area at the Playhouse Theatre and Coke
officials holding court in another.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he believed there were two opposing schools of
thought within Coke that were delaying a settlement. One group, he
said, wanted a quick resolution, but the other wanted to make only
minimal restitution for years of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, however, said the company has a ``firm resolve'' to settle
the suit in a speedy and equitable manner.
</P>
<P>
   But parties have difficult hurdles to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has ordered the parties to enter mediation
talks, which only began face to face last week. The legal
situation, however, has gotten murkier on the plaintiffs' side with
last week's entrance of prominent attorney Willie Gary of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gary now represents four of the eight plaintiffs and is in the
process of trying to peel away more employees who would be included
in a prospective class of 2,000, if the case is given class-action
status. While Gary cannot participate in the settlement process, he
could complicate matters if he's successful in luring more clients.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary cannot participate in the mediation talks, and the
plaintiffs he currently represents can no longer represent the
prospective class. Meanwhile, attorney Cyrus Mehri and his legal
team continue to represent the four other plaintiffs, as well as
the prospective class.

COMMUNITY LEADERS SAY SUIT POSSIBLE OVER SHOOTING OF POLICEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ The day after authorities said a state grand
jury would not indict two police officers in the shooting death of
a black off-duty patrolman, community activists made it clear: that
result is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Following a tense afternoon meeting with Mayor Vincent A.
Cianci, members of the Rhode Island Ministerial Alliance said
Wednesday that they may file a federal civil lawsuit against the
Providence Police Department and the two officers, if the family of
slain Sgt. Cornel Young Jr. assents.
</P>
<P>
   Those same leaders later met behind closed doors with US Rep.
Patrick J. Kennedy in Pawtucket and asked him to spur on a federal
review of the Jan. 28 shooting and the grand jury's results. And
they spoke by telephone with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder,
Janet Reno's top aide at the US Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the grand jury findings, there still has not been
closure,'' Kennedy said at a press conference after the meeting.
``Questions are still out there. We need to find out how we get to
the bottom of this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said he, Cornel Young Sr. and a Ministerial
Alliance delegation are planning a trip to Washington soon for a
meeting with Holder and Bill Lan Lee, who operates the Justice
Department's civil rights divison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to support anyone who can come forward to find out
what happened to my son that night,'' the elder Young said at the
press conference. ``I want no stone left unturned.''
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia, and U.S. Rep. John
Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan _ both veterans of the civil
rights movement _ will be in Providence next month to discuss the
shootings with the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no faith in the system,'' said the Rev. Marlowe V.N.
Washington, a member of the alliance. ``We have an out-of-control
police department that is not accountable to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday if Cornel Young Sr. _ a Providence
Police major and the department's highest-ranking black officer _
and his ex-wife, Leisa, plan to allow the Alliance to move forward
with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Since their son was killed, Young's parents have repeatedly
urged the federal governement for an independent investigation into
the late-night shooting outside Fidas Restaurant, a 24-hour diner
in South Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who had stopped for a sandwich around midnight, charged
outside with his weapon drawn to break up an armed confrontation in
the parking lot. Officers Carlos Saraiva and Michael Solitro III,
two of Young's comrades who had been dispatched to the scene,
apparently thought Young was one of the combatants as he held a
suspect, Aldrin Diaz, at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Solitro and Saraiva opened fire when Young did not
obey their commands to drop his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers were removed from duty pending a grand jury
investigation into the shooting, conducted with evidence collected
by a specially-appointed, nine-member law enforcement task force _
which included six Providence police officers. The grand jury's
conclusions were announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and other community activists spent much of Wednesday
condemning city officials for failing to actively heal the wounds
left by Young's death _ and their dispassionate reactions to the
grand jury's decision not to indict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a great deal of insensitivity,'' Washington
said, referring to Providence Police Chief Urban Prignano Jr.'s
remarks that he would welcome both Saraiva and Solitro back on
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police chief is supposed to be neutral. But he's not being
neutral when he makes these kinds of statements,'' Washington said.
``There's no respect for the dead and the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Washington and five community representatives met with
Cianci at City Hall for about an hour, but reached few conclusions,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he made it clear that he can not prevent Saraiva
or Solitro from getting their badges back, though he has heard that
Solitro has no plans to rejoin the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting started off a little rocky,'' Cianci said, ``but I
think it turned out to be a good exchange.'' But the community
representatives said Cianci seemed hostile and defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to change the grand jury results,'' said
Cianci, in an interview before the meeting. ``We have to move
forward in harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Leisa Young was expected to attend the meeting with the mayor,
but Washington said she changed her mind because ``she's lost
confidence'' in local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Many others here say they, too, are disillusioned by recent
events, but still hope to win justice for Young's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a shock, but it still doesn't lessen the blow,''
said John Osmand, a grassroots activist with the Campaign Against
Wrongful Convictions. ``It's still enraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmand and others say they're glad authorities decided not to
prosecute Diaz, 30, for the murder of Young. Police maintained he
was responsible because his actions ultimately led the officers to
shoot Young, but activists said he was merely a scapegoat for the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Paula Diaz, 59, said she's angry that her son still faces
up to 50 years in prison on charges of assault with a dangerous
weapon and possession of a pistol without a license in connection
with the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who had drawn a gun but dropped it just moments before
Solitro and Saravia opened fire, was sentenced to 12 years in
prison for a weapons-related probation violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are still trying to cover themselves,'' Paula Diaz
said. ``My son is mad because he's sitting in jail and he's never
killed anyone, but the officers who killed Sgt. Young are being
welcomed back on the police department. Now that's just stupid.''

FATHER TRIES TO DEAL WITH STUNNING GRAND JURY DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Police Major Cornel Young Sr., dressed in
faded jeans and a grey sweatshirt, groaned slightly Wednesday as he
hoisted a large photograph of his slain son toward a tiny hook on
his living-room wall.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act didn't work, and the picture dipped
precariously off-kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Young's life, too, is dramatically askew.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview Wednesday, Young said that, in his
heart, he does not know whether grand jurors made the right
decision when they cleared two police officers who killed his son.
After a stellar 25-year career, he said he is considering turning
in his badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still confused,'' said Young, the highest-ranking black
officer on the Providence police force. ``I mean, this grand jury
just brings all the sorrow back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the wind's knocked out of you. I'm reliving this all
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Rhode Island grand jury cleared two white officers
who apparently mistook Sergeant Cornel Young Jr., a black man in
civilian clothes, for an armed suspect during a late-night fracas
on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, one day after the judgment, Young's searing loss
was laid bare again during an incessant media blitz. His son, a
three year veteran of the force, was only 29.
</P>
<P>
   Young, whose comments carry great weight among an angered
minority community here, said he ``has to have confidence'' that
the secret grand jury process was fair. But the family's doubts and
questions about what really happened outside a Providence
restaurant that night seemed painfully apparent.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he believes the grand jurors rendered the correct
decision, after reviewing all relevant evidence, Young put his
hands to his head and replied: ``In my heart, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I hope is that the investigation was done thoroughly, with
nothing misrepresented and nothing omitted,'' Young said. ``Being a
police officer, I expect nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Although still proud of his department, Young said he might turn
in his badge despite pleas from family, friends, and community
leaders that he is needed more than ever on a police force often at
odds with minority residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I go back, or don't I go back,'' asked Young, sighing, his
arms outstretched as if seeking help with an impossible question.
``I've had many letters, saying that if I retire I'm giving up, and
I'm not going to be able to fix this problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, my family, everyone wants me to go back. But I have
to,'' he said, pausing and thinking, ``I have to make up my own
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Young had made up his mind, even before Tuesday's announcement,
that the grand jury would clear officers Carlos A. Saraiva and
Michael Solitro III. ``It's what I expected,'' Young said, adding
that an investigation by a federal or out-of-state agency probably
would have reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, Young welcomes further inquiry into the
shooting, including an ongoing probe by the Boston office of the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the truth to come out,'' Young said. ``I don't care if
there are 100 agencies involved in the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said that community skepticism about the grand jury, which
examined evidence collected by a nine-member law-enforcement team
that included six Providence officers, could have been addressed by
assigning the case to investigators from outside Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the community's not satisfied. I don't expect them
to be,'' Young said. ``I do hope that everyone can remain calm and
can get through this thing and concentrate on getting something
positive from this tragedy so it doesn't happen to another police
officer, black or white, male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he has not spoken to Saraiva or Solitro, although he
has been approached on their behalf. ``I expect I'll bump into them
at some point,'' he said softly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Young added, his family needs time _ once again
_ to heal. ``I'm hoping, once the media attention dies down, I can
spend some time with my family, and my son's mother, and come to
some sort of solution, some kind of closure for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Young rose from the chair, walked his visitor to the
door, and returned to the memento-filled living room of his modest
South Providence home.
</P>
<P>
   And there, against a wall, leaned the picture of his son, a
striking man looking confidently at the world from under a
Providence police cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Young said, ``if we'll ever find out what
happened.''

COMMENTARY: A DETECTIVE'S ORDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When two New York City detectives from the Police Department's
Internal Affairs Bureau, Sgt. Robert Boyce and Sgt. Michael
McWilliams, headed up to Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, N.Y., on
March 16, 1995, their mission was to get whatever information they
could _ something, anything _ to bring down a fellow cop, an
undercover narcotics detective with a spotless record named Zaher
Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted Zahrey, known as Zack, bad. There were rumors going
around about him. He was corrupt. He was tipping off gangsters to
drug-selling locations so the gangsters could raid and rob them. He
was a louse of the lowest order, that Zahrey. Yes, he was. No doubt
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that they didn't have any evidence. They
had tried and tried to get something on Zack but had come up dry.
</P>
<P>
   I have come to learn that in the criminal justice system the
absence of evidence is not an insurmountable problem. Evidence can
always be manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The man Boyce and McWilliams went to see that day was a real,
no-question-about-it lowlife. His name was Sidney Quick, and this
little tidbit about him will give you a sense of how credible he
was. He was in Sing Sing under his brother's name, Rubin Quick.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how bad a guy Sidney Quick was, consider that
he was a crackhead who slept with an automatic weapon by his
pillow, robbed men and women at gunpoint, once held a gun to the
head of his wife's daughter, robbed one of his in-laws at gunpoint,
held up drug dealers, shot a man who was slow to respond in one of
his robberies, and was a suspect in the murder of a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   None of that bothered Boyce and McWilliams. What they knew was
that Quick knew Zahrey from the Brooklyn neighborhood in which both
men lived, and that Quick was facing not only a term of six years
to life in Sing Sing as a persistent violent offender, but the
possibility of being prosecuted for additional violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Quick was anxious to do whatever he could to get his prison time
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Lies from a lowlife facing hard time are viewed by most cops as
part of the natural order, as common as snow in the Arctic or the
surf in the Caribbean. Unscrupulous cops and prosecutors will
develop and craft those lies for use in criminal prosecutions. But
that ugly process is usually done in secret.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual about the conversation at Sing Sing on March
16, 1995, was that it was taped. So we get to hear Boyce, in a
reference to the murder of the drug dealer, tell Quick: ``You know
it's easy to blame you, Sidney. People on the outside are gonna
blame the people on the inside. And you're already here and you
ain't around to defend yourself. Know what I'm sayin'?''
</P>
<P>
   And we get to hear him say: ``Your name was all over that
(expletive) case. All over it!''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Quick should be prosecuted for the murder and, if
found guilty, kept in jail for life?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. Because we also hear Boyce say to Quick: ``If you
give me Zack, I'll drive you home.''
</P>
<P>
   And we hear McWilliams tell Quick: ``I, honestly, I don't care
if you were there, you know that? I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Quick replies: ``Yeah, you just care if Zack was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And McWilliams answers: ``You know what I care about. Right,
that's all I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   He then thoughtfully adds: ``You know what else I care about. I
care that you tell me the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Quick dutifully lied. He told the cops about all kinds of crimes
that Zack had supposedly committed. But neither the cops, nor the
office of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes (which did all
kinds of favors for Quick, including sending him money), nor the
office of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District could
corroborate Quick's fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney used Quick's testimony to prosecute Zahrey for
corruption, but a jury, appalled, reached a verdict of acquittal
within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A sane person would think the matter would end there. But no.
Zahrey still faces possible dismissal from the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   And Quick is up for parole next month.
</P>

EX-DAY-CARE OPERATOR SEEKS RELEASE IN '80S ABUSE CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A team of high-profile attorneys asked Governor Paul
Cellucci Wednesday to free Gerald ``Tooky'' Amirault, the last of
three family members still imprisoned for sexually abusing children
at their day care center in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be a model citizen,'' Amirault, 45, told reporters at a
press conference at Bay State Correctional Institution in Norfolk.
``I never was a criminal before, and I wouldn't be afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Amirault, his mother Violet, and his sister Cheryl
Amirault LeFave _ all of whom were convicted of raping and
assaulting children at Fells Acres Day School in suburban Malden _
was the first of several such cases that sprouted coast-to-coast in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more cases popped up, a national debate on the
reliability of testimony gathered from children ensued, and soon,
defendants in similar cases were being released from prison _
including Amirault's sister and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Gerald Amirault's case came to symbolize the
problems inherent in taking testimony from young children, he
watched his appeals fail time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with hope of a judicial remedy all but dead, Amirault
got his most high-profile support yet, as Harvard Law professor
Charles J. Ogletree and noted criminal defense attorney Harvey A.
Silverglate announced they would join his bid for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference at Harvard Law School, the two
attorneys said they was drawn to the case after watching with
disbelief as Amirault's several attempts to have his conviction
overturned were thwarted over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that a grave injustice has been done to a
family, not because of a crime, but because of mass hysteria that
ensued as a result of the horrible allegations,'' Ogletree said, as
members of the legal team and Amirault's family nodded.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum to Cellucci, they asked the governor to grant
executive clemency in the case, and commute Amirault's sentence to
time already served _ 14 years _ rather than force him to finish
his 30- to 40-year term.
</P>
<P>
   His sister was freed last fall. Their mother, freed on appeal in
1995, died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he would keep a ``very open mind'' about the
petition, saying he would weigh the evidence and arguments from
both sides before uttering an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure justice is served,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County District Attorney Martha Coakley, whose
predecessors won the Amirault convictions, said in a statement that
commuting Amirault's sentence would be ``neither appropriate nor in
the interest of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All legal and factual issues relating to this case have been
resolved in the courts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Sultan, Amirault's lead attorney, accused Coakley's
office of treating his client's case differently than those of his
sister or mother solely because Amirault is male. The cases, he
said, were identical in every way but the gender of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spin is, in these kinds of cases, the women aren't really
that important, but there's a man, an evil man, who's the real
wrongdoer,'' Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   A parent of one of the children involved in the case said
Wednesday that such claims are preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Amirault) is the only one who testified, so he hung
himself,'' the mother said. ``He got more years not because he was
male or female. He got more time because he was even worse than the
others. They can ask for whatever they want, but they were all
guilty. How many judges and juries have to agree on the same thing
before they finally give up?''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley concurred, saying ``This case must be viewed on its own
facts and aggravated circumstances related to sentencing. A review
of the facts and legal issues demonstrates that the conviction was
sound and the sentencing fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine children who contended they were abused at Fells Acres
between 1981 and 1984 testified against Gerald Amirault, and four
testified against his mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   The children, ages 3 to 6 years old, said the Amiraults had
sexually assaulted them, used objects to abuse them, and
photographed them in a ``magic room.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said Gerald Amirault dressed as a clown while abusing them,
and one 6-year-old boy said he was bitten by a robot at the school,
tied naked to a tree in front of teachers, and forced to watch
LeFave pull the legs off a squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Amirault's wife, Patricia, and his three children made tearful
pleas to Cellucci to disregard their father's conviction and take a
dispassionate view toward his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and brother and I have lived our whole lives without
our father,'' said Katie Amirault, a college sophomore. ``He's
missed out on so much. He's missed out on our graduations from
elementary school, high school, and I'm really hoping he won't miss
college. We need him back home where he belongs. He doesn't deserve
this.''

CONFEDERATE SYMBOL IN GEORGIA FLAG DRAWS GROWING OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ark., Fla., Miss., S.C.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The banner that has convulsed South Carolina flies
from a single flagpole. But next door in Georgia _ often regarded
as the template for a New South state _ the symbol of the old
Confederacy flies from a thousand poles as the main element in the
official state flag, and the movement to change it is gathering
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is one of five states that incorporates Confederate
elements into its flag, but it does so more prominently than
anywhere else. The red-and-blue St. Andrew's Cross that was used as
the battle symbol of the Confederacy occupies fully two-thirds of
the Georgia flag, and visitors to the state often mistake it for
the battle flag itself. In 1991, when Clarence Thomas was being
confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, several of his antagonists
remembered seeing the Confederate flag on his desk in the past, but
it turned out to be the flag of his native Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi also displays the diagonal cross in the upper left
corner, or canton, of its flag. Alabama, Arkansas and Florida have
less recognizable symbols of the Confederacy in their flags.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia and Mississippi, there have been several unsuccessful
efforts over the decades to change the flag and remove elements
that are considered by many black residents to be celebrations of
slavery and secession. But the damage inflicted by the NAACP's
boycott of South Carolina _ where the Confederate flag flies under
the state flag atop the Capitol dome _ has heartened flag opponents
elsewhere in the South, who believe they now have the momentum to
bring about a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the old redneck, racist Georgia it was in 1956,
when the all-male, all-white Legislature decided to desecrate the
flag as an act of defiance against the federal government,'' state
Rep. Tyrone Brooks, an Atlanta Democrat, who is black, said of the
Legislature's decision to add the Confederate symbol to the state
flag. ``The climate's different now, in part thanks to South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and other Georgia legislators said they decided not to
push the issue in the legislative session that recently ended,
fearing that a change would have a more difficult time in an
election year. But they will spend the rest of the year building
support for a new flag for next year's session, and hope to have
the support of Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat who says there are not
enough votes in the Legislature right now to change the flag. In
1994, Gov. Zell Miller's advocacy of a new flag almost cost him his
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference called
for a tourism boycott of Georgia if lawmakers did not make a change
in next year's session. Legislators say they have already begun
receiving calls from business and tourism lobbyists, urging them to
find their way to a compromise to protect the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, where the flag has borne the Confederate symbol
since 1894, there is even less support for change. On Monday, a
lone black legislator, Rep. Jimmy Thornton of Greenville, began a
procedural protest of the Legislature's refusal to consider a flag
bill, demanding that every bill under consideration be read aloud
and in full. Although this is the prerogative of any legislator,
the full reading has sharply slowed the progress of the House this
week, and has annoyed many of Thornton's colleagues, who tend to
walk out of the chamber when a bill is read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if they walk out,'' Thornton, a Democrat, said.
``They all tell me it's political suicide for a white member of the
Legislature to vote to change the flag, so I have to do this to
shake things up. And we're going to have to have a boycott, to get
the business community on it. It will be hard, but it will get
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the City Council of Jackson, the state capital,
voted to stop displaying the state flag in the council chambers. A
few days later, some legislators began advocating a law that would
cut off financing to cities that did not display the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has refused to fly the state flag on any municipal
buildings since 1990, and some jurisdictions around Georgia have
occasionally flown the previous state flag, which lacks the
Confederate cross. The Legislature added the Confederate symbol in
1956, less than two years after the Brown vs. Board of Education
decision rendered school segregation illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Although some former legislators have said the flag was changed
in preparation for the centennial of the Civil War in 1961, many
historians believe the change was an act of defiance against
federal civil rights legislation. Gov. Marvin Griffin, a Democrat
who signed the new flag into law, was a strong proponent of
segregation, and often said he was elected to prevent ``mixed
schools'' in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Georgia State University this year said that 56
percent of state residents want to keep the current flag, and
Barnes said in a recent interview that the ``public isn't ready
yet'' for a new flag. He said he wanted to begin a dialogue with
both sides while working on more important priorities, like
education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Many white legislators from rural areas like the flag the way it
is, but there was a sign of movement recently when a white
Republican state senator, Mike Egan of north Atlanta, introduced a
bill to change the flag. The bill never made it out of committee,
but Egan, who is retiring after this term, believes that most of
his colleagues understand the time has come for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to put it in quietly, so it would pass without Al
Sharpton coming down,'' Egan said. ``It's going to be harder now,
with everybody demanding it. But everyone knows it's going to
happen eventually. Let's do it before the boycott starts.''

STUDY DOWNPLAYS ROLE OF GENES IN STIMULATING BRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young animals with ``rewired'' brains proved able to see using
structures in the brain normally reserved for interpreting sounds,
MIT scientists report.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments showed that areas of the brain designed by
nature to perform one highly specialized task can adapt to doing
another simply by being exposed to different information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profound discovery that addresses age-old questions
about whether the brain is genetically programmed or shaped by the
environment,'' said Mriganka Sur, professor and head of the
Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers said the results challenge current thinking by
showing how powerfully information from the environment can
override the effects of genes in shaping the brain as it develops.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, they said this newly revealed ``plasticity''
of the brain might be used to recruit healthy parts of the brain to
take over the tasks of areas damaged by accident or illness.
</P>
<P>
   Sur and his colleagues are authors of two papers about their
discoveries being published in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sur said he has been working for a decade on
the question of ``how the brain becomes the brain.'' Specifically,
he added, he has asked ``why do certain areas of the brain process
specific tasks,'' such as information for seeing, hearing, and
touching.
</P>
<P>
   In light of all the new discoveries about the importance of
genes in determining now the body operates, Sur said he wanted to
find out whether the brain's specialized areas are innately that
way.
</P>
<P>
   The animals used in the experiments were ferrets, which are born
very early in their development _ at a point comparable to the late
second or early third trimester in humans, Sur said.
</P>
<P>
   In delicate surgery, the scientists rerouted nerves coming from
the back of the ferrets' eyes so that they led to the primary
auditory center, which is reserved for nerve impulses from the
ears.
</P>
<P>
   When they matured, testing showed that the ferrets could respond
to visual information _ juice spouts placed in different positions,
for example _ that was processed by the formerly hearing-oriented
brain structures.
</P>
<P>
   And other experiments showed that the auditory brain structures
had undergone physical changes, so they more closely resembled the
visual centers of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   But how does receiving different nerve impulses create all this
change? That's still being studied, Sur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to imagine intuitively how sound might have the
properties of vision, and I don't have a good sense of how that
might be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists did the brain rewiring just after the animals
were born. It will take more research to find out how long the
brain is so flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kaas, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University who
studies similar questions, said the reports ``are major papers''
that challenge the recent emphasis on the power of genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will push people back toward more consideration of
environmental factors in creating normal brain organization,'' Kaas
said.

reports, that the ``fascinating papers'' provide ``some of the most
compelling evidence yet for the exquisite sensitivity of cortical

   Although they were the unanimous choice of the judges _ who
reviewed 624 designs from 50 states and 23 countries _ the
husband-and-wife team of architects who designed the Oklahoma City
memorial, Torrey and Hans-Ekkehard Butzer, are young and until now
have had little recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Butzer, 33, was born in Nowata, Okla., and spent her childhood
in Wichita, Kan. Butzer, 34, was born in Madison, Wis., to German
parents, and grew up there and in Chicago. The two met as
architecture students at the University of Texas, where they
decided to become business partners before they got married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after graduation, the pair moved to Germany, where
reunification had sparked a building boom. They settled in Berlin
and founded a firm called Locus Bold Design with Sven Berg, a
German architect. Since then, Butzer has worked on designs for
public housing, hospitals, an auto showroom and other commercial
ventures, while Butzer has focused on design competitions for
museums and civic projects in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   This was their first memorial design, and Butzer has said he
wanted to convey the idea that ``good will prevail.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sixty-five percent of American households have
returned their census forms, matching the mail-in rate of 10 years
ago and enhancing prospects for a successful count, relieved
federal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gratified with the nation's response,'' Commerce
Secretary William M. Daley said in a statement issued after Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt gave an optimistic briefing that
contrasted starkly with one he gave two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious achievement,'' Prewitt said. The latest
results constitute a heartening reversal in ``the trend toward
civic disengagement,'' he added, turning to a phrase he has used
often of late.
</P>
<P>
   He used the same words on April 4, when he lamented that only 55
percent of households had mailed back their census forms, versus
the 61 percent the Census Bureau had hoped for by then.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he hoped for a flood of mail returns, so that
the mail-response target of 70 percent _ 5 percentage points over
the 1990 response level _ might be reached. He said Wednesday he
hoped late returns might nudge the final mail results closer to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on April 27, Prewitt said Wednesday, census workers
will try to contact all who did not return their forms ``so that we
can achieve a 100 percent count of our nation's population.''
</P>
<P>
   That ultimate goal may be too optimistic, especially in view of
the 1990 census. It is undisputed that the 1990 census counted
millions of people twice and missed many millions of others
altogether, for an undercount of several million people.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of the final count has profound implications,
affecting the number of congressional representatives each state is
allotted, the amount of school aid, anti-poverty money and other
social assistance that flows from Washington to local governments,
and where roads, schools and sewers are built.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 count was met with less cooperation from the people
than the one of 1980, and it was recognized as having been less
accurate than the one of 1980 as well. Intent on keeping the 2000
census from being less accurate still, federal officials have tried
to defuse comments from politicians' voicing concerns about privacy
issues, and they have tried to persuade immigrants _ traditionally
suspicious of the federal bureaucracy _ that they have nothing to
lose and much to gain by cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   Returns of the short form are actually running slightly ahead of
the pace of a decade ago, Prewitt said, but returns of the long
form, which is sent to about one in six households, are running
several percentage points behind the 1990 pace.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in 1990, much of the South has recorded relatively
low returns, under 60 percent in several states, while the Midwest
has seen the best response rate, more than 70 percent in some
states.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the door-to-door visits of households that did
not mail back their returns, Prewitt asked for the public's
cooperation. Census officials have estimated that each percentage
point the mail-return rate goes up means 1.2 million fewer
households that must be visited _ at a cost of up to $35 a
household.

 &HT;    COURTS EXTENDS BAN ON REMOVING ELIAN FROM U.S.
 &HT;    With CUBA-RENO
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Tears flowed and shouts of joy rang out through Cuban
Miami Wednesday after an Atlanta federal appeals court extended a
temporary ban on removing Elian Gonzalez from the United States and
raised serious questions about the federal government's approach to
the controversial case.
</P>
<P>
   But the showdown over the boy is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not stop federal officials from taking Elian to
his father as long as the pair stays in this country, and a
confrontation over the boy's immediate future still seemed
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's order does not preclude me from placing Elian in
his father's care,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno, shortly
after the 16-page decision was issued. But the court turned down
Reno's request that it order the Florida family to immediately turn
the boy over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives broke into tears on hearing news of the
ruling, a family attorney said, and crowds outside their Little
Havana home cheered, hugged, cried and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gonzalez family continues to believe in the laws of the
U.S. and will continue to pray so that all of this may come true
for Elian,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, who has
cared for the boy since he was rescued at sea last November.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was at the
Cuban Interests Section when the ruling was announced. He made no
public statement, but his attorney firmly demanded that Reno
reunite him with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the order issued today undermines this father's
legal and moral claim that he be given immediate custody of his
son,'' said Gregory Craig. ``We call upon the U.S. government to
take immediate action. It is unconscionable to wait one day
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been living at the home of a top Cuban diplomat in
the Washington, D.C. area since arriving in the United States two
weeks ago. He has promised to remain in this country until the
court case is resolved _ if he is reunited with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling seemed to shift the momentum to Elian's Miami
relatives, who have argued for months that the boy shouldn't be
removed without a day in court and that he should have an asylum
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ordered Elian reunited with his father in January, but the
Florida family went to federal court to block the order and request
the asylum hearing. A Miami federal judge upheld Reno's order in
March, and the family immediately appealed to the Atlanta court.
</P>
<P>
   The court is scheduled to hear the full matter on May 11, but
last week issued the temporary ban on Elian's removal from the
United States. Wednesday's order extended the ban until the outcome
of the May 11 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But the court raised pointed questions about the government's
arguments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to extend the ban on Elian's removal from the U.S. could
``deprive the Plaintiff (Elian) forever of something of great
value: his day in a court of law,'' the three-judge panel ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In their motions, lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service argued that Elian has no right to an asylum hearing because
his father is the only one who can legally speak for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But the court pointed out _ as have lawyers for the Miami family
_ that U.S. laws plainly spell out that ``any alien who is
physically present in the United States....may apply for asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian ``appears to come within the meaning of 'any alien,''' the
court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The panel went further, citing INS's own regulations that
specifically address how immigration officers should handle cases
involving children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing INS regulations do envision situations where a
minor may act on his own behalf in immigration matters,'' the court
stated. ``Moreover, the regulations contemplate that a minor, under
some circumstances, may seek asylum against the express wishes of
his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also gave weight to Elian's own desires _ expressed in
a controversial video tape made by his Miami relatives and in court
papers _ to stay in the United States. The judges also echoed a
repeated complaint of the family _ that federal officials have
never examined or interviewed the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have(cq) INS officials attempted to
interview Plaintiff about his own wishes,'' the ruling said. ``It
is not clear that the INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the
only proper representative, considered all of the relevant factors
_ particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded by cautioning that the parties should make
no predictions on how it would ultimately rule, although it said
the Miami family clearly had strong arguments that must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   The decision seemed a blow to the government.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing prior to the ruling, Reno indicated that she
was awaiting the ruling before she would act. Afterwards, she
maintained that she can still reunite Elian with his father, but
now she will have to do so without the Atlanta court's explicit
backing.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the next step in the long-running drama
might be.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban exiles were happy, but cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day, but it's only a little victory,'' said Rene
Iturrey(cq), 41, a real estate salesman who has taken off several
days from work to come to the house and protest. ``This family has
been able to find refuge in the federal courts. This family
reunification must take place, but you don't accomplish that by
dragging the child out of this home and demonizing this family.''

GEPHARDT VOWS TO OPPOSE NORMAL TRADE TIES WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-POLITICS) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, said
Wednesday that he would oppose permanent normal trade relations
with China because it would relinquish U.S. leverage over Beijing's
behavior on human rights and religious liberties.
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate rebuttal to many of the Clinton administration's
pro-trade arguments, Gephardt said that giving up Congress' annual
review of China's trade status would be ``a recipe for serious
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America should not trust the Chinese government to make
progress on its own and unilaterally surrender our nation's ability
to influence Chinese policy through trade,'' Gephardt said in a
speech in St. Louis, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's announcement puts him at odds with virtually every
senior Democrat in his party, from President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive presidential nominee, to the
Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   But given Gephardt's strong ties to organized labor, which
opposes the measure, his decision came as no surprise. He has
spoken to Clinton about his views, most recently last week, and
called Gore on Tuesday to explain his decision, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, Gephardt's spokeswoman, said the call to Gore was
``a simple notification call.'' A spokesman for Gore said the vice
president, who has been calling wavering Democrats in recent days,
had no comment on Gephardt's decision or their conversation. Gore's
Republican presidential rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   More important for Gore and for congressional Democrats eager to
retake the House this fall, Gephardt has vowed not to let the vote
divide the party in the fall elections. He says he will not make
the China trade vote a litmus test of party loyalty or lobby his
colleagues, leaving that chore to the No. 2 House Democrat, David
E. Bonior of Michigan, who also opposes the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on China's trade status will determine to what degree
the United States benefits from China's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manner in which Dick has conducted himself has really
allowed us to secure a significant number of Democratic votes,''
said Rep. Cal Dooley of California, a top Democratic vote counter
for the measure who Wednesday predicted victory.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial vote is set for the week of May 22. As many as 150
Republicans will likely support the measure, leaving Democrats in
favor scrambling to scrape up the rest needed to reach the 218
votes for passage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 40 undecided House Democrats control the measure's fate,
and in interviews Wednesday, many expressed conflicting views on
the significance of Gephardt's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll really affect my decision,'' said Rep.
Diana DeGette, D-Colo. ``I'm trying to weigh what the best decision
is for my district and for the economy of my district.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also tried to play down Gephardt's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., said: ``It helps move me in a
similar direction. Dick Gephardt is widely respected, particularly
on trade matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Gephardt's announcement is significant because the
House is in a two-week recess, and during this last extended time
at home before the vote, uncommitted lawmakers will be the target
of lobbying from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at Webster University to an audience of students
and civic leaders, Gephardt at one point sought to calm a debate
over China trade that he said ``has become overly polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   But then in animated remarks, he assailed arguments for the
deal, which he said put the nation's economic interests ahead of
its equally important commitment to human freedom and liberty
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainable development and worker rights must be at the core
of our trade policy,'' Gephardt said. ``Otherwise, we have no
assurance that trade will contribute to enhanced living standards
at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the global economy is transforming market
forces, Gephardt said he was neither ``a protectionist, nor am I a
free-trader,'' but rather an advocate for trade accords that
incorporate tougher labor, environmental and human rights
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no debate about whether America should engage China,''
he said. ``The question is how to engage so trade access can be
matched with steady progress toward greater human rights and rule
of law in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gephardt said he tried to broker a measure with the
White House, business and labor groups, and their allies, that
would lock in ``suitable enforcement mechanisms'' for those
standards. But he said he failed.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt suggested maybe that wasn't such a bad outcome. He
challenged the predictions made by the measure's supporters that
broader access to Chinese markets would necessarily pry open a
repressive regime.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, who had been suspicious of Gephardt's
silence until now on the trade bill, criticized him for being out
of step with new economic realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gephardt's decision is based not on sound economic
principles,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert. ``Rather, it is based on
fear, fear of the political power of big labor, fear of the
implications of the new economy, fear of the future.''

TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO END VIOLENCE TOWARD WHITE FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ President Robert Mugabe, under international
pressure to end violence as he heads into elections that could dent
or even end his party's 20-year dominance of Zimbabwe, on Wednesday
brought together leaders of white farmers and the black former
guerrilla fighters who have led recent raids on white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the two sides in the growing
confrontation over land reform yielded a tentative agreement to end
the violence that has claimed the lives of two white farmers since
Friday. But there was no sign of an end to the occupation of
white-owned land by blacks who are disappointed that they are still
landless two decades after their successful war for independence
from Britain, nor was there mention of halting the violence
directed at a new opposition party.
</P>

   Mugabe met with Tim Henwood, the president of the Commercial
Farmers' Union, and Chenjerai Hunzvi, president of the War
Veterans' Association. Afterward the three described their meeting
as a first step toward a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've agreed is the hostilities should end,'' Hunzvi told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Henwood said in an interview that, ``We found some common
ground, and we agreed to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two said they planned further meetings to try to reach an
understanding on the future of land reform _ a crucial issue for
race relations and for Zimbabwe's crumbling economy, since
agriculture is the country's biggest hard-currency earner.
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with political and economic crises and falling
popularity ahead of next month's parliamentary elections, the
government has been accused by critics of using land redistribution
to win votes among poor blacks, thus fanning racial and political
animosities.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, two white farmers have died, and two black
supporters of a new opposition party were killed when when their
car was firebombed, apparently by supporters of the governing
ZANU-PF party. Earlier this month, two other opposition party
figures were killed in yet unexplained circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With the killings, international pressure has mounted on Mugabe
to take strong action to stop the violence, end the farm
occupations and restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, Mugabe had mixed tentative steps toward
a resolution with belligerent statements that seemed likely to
encourage more confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed satisfaction at Wednesday's meeting. ``It has
created an atmosphere of understanding even though there may not
have been the necessary solution on both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A halt to violence and intimidation aimed at the new opposition
movement seems less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the trade union leader Morgan Tsvangirai, the movement,
which is less than a year old, is mounting the most serious
challenge ever to Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF. Opposition members
charge that Mugabe loyalists have countered with intense
intimidation.

   At a news conference Wednesday, the opposition party's
secretary-general said the offensive was pushing otherwise peaceful
citizens closer to striking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting very, very angry, and ultimately we will
not be able to guarantee that they will not resort to self-help,''
Welshman Ncube, the secretary-general, said. ``The only way they
will continue to abide by the law is if they have confidence that
the law will protect them.``
</P>
<P>
   The current climate in rural areas has made fair elections all
but impossible, Ncube said.

GEPHARDT VOWS TO OPPOSE NORMAL TRADE TIES WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-POLITICS) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, said
Wednesday that he would oppose permanent normal trade relations
with China because it would relinquish U.S. leverage over Beijing's
behavior on human rights and religious liberties.
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate rebuttal to many of the Clinton administration's
pro-trade arguments, Gephardt said that giving up Congress' annual
review of China's trade status would be ``a recipe for serious
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America should not trust the Chinese government to make
progress on its own and unilaterally surrender our nation's ability
to influence Chinese policy through trade,'' Gephardt said in a
speech in St. Louis, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's announcement puts him at odds with virtually every
senior Democrat in his party, from President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive presidential nominee, to the
Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   But given Gephardt's strong ties to organized labor, which
opposes the measure, his decision came as no surprise. He has
spoken to Clinton about his views, most recently last week, and
called Gore on Tuesday to explain his decision, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, Gephardt's spokeswoman, said the call to Gore was
``a simple notification call.'' A spokesman for Gore said the vice
president, who has been calling wavering Democrats in recent days,
had no comment on Gephardt's decision or their conversation. Gore's
Republican presidential rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   More important for Gore and for congressional Democrats eager to
retake the House this fall, Gephardt has vowed not to let the vote
divide the party in the fall elections. He says he will not make
the China trade vote a litmus test of party loyalty or lobby his
colleagues, leaving that chore to the No. 2 House Democrat, David
E. Bonior of Michigan, who also opposes the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on China's trade status will determine to what degree
the United States benefits from China's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manner in which Dick has conducted himself has really
allowed us to secure a significant number of Democratic votes,''
said Rep. Cal Dooley of California, a top Democratic vote counter
for the measure who Wednesday predicted victory.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial vote is set for the week of May 22. As many as 150
Republicans will likely support the measure, leaving Democrats in
favor scrambling to scrape up the rest needed to reach the 218
votes for passage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 40 undecided House Democrats control the measure's fate,
and in interviews Wednesday, many expressed conflicting views on
the significance of Gephardt's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll really affect my decision,'' said Rep.
Diana DeGette, D-Colo. ``I'm trying to weigh what the best decision
is for my district and for the economy of my district.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also tried to play down Gephardt's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., said: ``It helps move me in a
similar direction. Dick Gephardt is widely respected, particularly
on trade matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Gephardt's announcement is significant because the
House is in a two-week recess, and during this last extended time
at home before the vote, uncommitted lawmakers will be the target
of lobbying from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at Webster University to an audience of students
and civic leaders, Gephardt at one point sought to calm a debate
over China trade that he said ``has become overly polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   But then in animated remarks, he assailed arguments for the
deal, which he said put the nation's economic interests ahead of
its equally important commitment to human freedom and liberty
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainable development and worker rights must be at the core
of our trade policy,'' Gephardt said. ``Otherwise, we have no
assurance that trade will contribute to enhanced living standards
at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the global economy is transforming market
forces, Gephardt said he was neither ``a protectionist, nor am I a
free-trader,'' but rather an advocate for trade accords that
incorporate tougher labor, environmental and human rights
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no debate about whether America should engage China,''
he said. ``The question is how to engage so trade access can be
matched with steady progress toward greater human rights and rule
of law in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gephardt said he tried to broker a measure with the
White House, business and labor groups, and their allies, that
would lock in ``suitable enforcement mechanisms'' for those
standards. But he said he failed.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt suggested maybe that wasn't such a bad outcome. He
challenged the predictions made by the measure's supporters that
broader access to Chinese markets would necessarily pry open a
repressive regime.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, who had been suspicious of Gephardt's
silence until now on the trade bill, criticized him for being out
of step with new economic realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gephardt's decision is based not on sound economic
principles,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert. ``Rather, it is based on
fear, fear of the political power of big labor, fear of the
implications of the new economy, fear of the future.''

SOME THINGS STAY THE SAME, LIKE YANKEES BEATING RANGERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many a sad and disturbing story currently stains the jock
kingdom landscape. For an example of what kind of week it's been
thus far, consider these items:
</P>
<P>
   Waco conspiracy kooks and other social misfits gather in Atlanta
to welcome Big Johnny Rocker back to baseball with a rousing
standing ovation. (Told you so, Mr. Commissioner. Your overreaction
made this brainless rock pile a hero to the fringe element.)
</P>
<P>
   Two able-bodied competitors were disqualified for entering and
racing in the wheelchair division of the Boston Marathon. There was
no mention if their cars were also found in handicapped parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, hockey fans in Edmonton boo the pregame playing of the
``Star-Spangled Banner''. But as a U.S. citizen who has made many a
hockey-related visit to Edmonton, here's a confession _ I've booed
everything about that gawd-awful place, except for the currency
exchange rate and the sportswriters, who always have entertaining
stuff in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Old friend Roman Turek whines about ``lucky'' San Jose goals as
the top-seeded Blues struggle in what was considered a gimme
series. It's a long, long way from last season, when Roman simply
watched as Eddie made the playoffs look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban out-Jerrys Jerry by repeatedly yukking it up on the
Reunion Arena P.A. mike before an overflow crowd in the Mavs' home
finale of the NBA season. Here's a suggestion, Mark. Next time,
make it only a very sincere ``thank you'' to the fans, then muzzle
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   And finally:
</P>
<P>
   Yankees torment Rangers at The Ballpark in Arlington. Does this
nightmare ever end?
</P>
<P>
   But the great thing about the jock kingdom, unlike the real
world, is none of the above will impact day-to-day life for the
masses. Actually, a select few have reaped financial reward because
of what happened this week. Local witch doctors and palm readers
saw a jump in business as confused Rangers fans sought an
explanation for the obvious voodoo involved in that
still-mysterious 11th inning on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday afternoon _ a 5-4 New York victory in 10 innings
and a series sweep _ the Yankees have left town, and the Rangers
will not see them again until mid-August, which is way too soon,
but it is four months of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Having played New York five times in eight days gives a totally
distorted picture of where this team is and where it might be later
on. But those are just facts of baseball life for the local lads.
Due to some unfortunate calamities against the pinstripes in the
postseason the past two years, both media and fans have a phobia
about how the Rangers ``measure up'' to the Yankees. It is probably
accurate to also expand that phobia to Tom Hicks, Doug Melvin,
Johnny Oates, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, however, is obvious. At the moment, nothing has
changed. The Rangers still don't measure up. But this is not
exactly a disgrace. For the past two seasons no team in baseball
has been in the Yankees' league, and it remains to be seen if any
of that changes this season.
</P>
<P>
   But control yourself. Do not assume all is lost in April just
because of more domination by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors have combined to lower this opening month deep into
the negative side, and both factors came in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back blown saves by John Wetteland made it look worse
than it really is. If what has been the most dependable stopper in
baseball converts on Sunday in Cleveland and in the ninth inning
against the Yankees on Monday, the early outlook swings 180
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, left fielder Rusty Greer went out for up to six weeks due
to ankle surgery, further disrupting what was already a batting
order that had been deprogrammed for runs batted in consistency.
Greer's absence makes the lineup appear even more puny, which, by
the way, it now is.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Wetteland. Is there a problem here?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' answered pitching coach Dick Bosman before yesterday's
game. ``Not physically and not mentally. He's fine in both those
areas. Outside of Lee Smith, John is the most resilient closer I've
ever been around, and the one with the shortest memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Closers have to be able to forget bad outings. Forget in a
hurry. If Wetteland bounces back and is his usual self, this will
be a good season for the Rangers. If not, it will be an awful year.
In today's game, a closer makes or breaks a team. The way Bosman
views it _ and he'd better be right _ Wetteland is not a worry.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said about Greer's absence. The Rangers were
already without Juan Gonzalez, Todd Zeile and Lee Stevens from last
season. That's a subtraction of 87 home runs and 307 RBI. Now,
Greer's 20 home runs and 101 RBI are gone for a month, and the
reworked batting order lacks proper balance and pop, which is why
the Rangers haven't scored more than four runs twice since
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, judge not. Five games in eight days against
the Yankees overloads the brain. Instead, just be thankful those
people are gone. nn

ECONOMIC SCENE: WHAT MOTIVATES TOP PROGRAMMERS TO WORK FOR FREE?

symbols, no parentheses or hyphen)  
 Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the
author of ``The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over
Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress.''  
 By VIRGINIA POSTREL C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When technology stocks took their sharp tumble last week, many
companies appeared to lose one of their most important assets _ the
ability to lure talented employees with options. To attract and
hold the best, you have to offer the chance to strike it rich.
</P>
<P>
   Or do you? What are we to think when the best of the best _ the
elite programmers that industry wisdom deems 100 times more
productive than the typical competent coder _ donate their precious
time to develop software anyone can use without charge? That is the
puzzle that the open-source movement, most famous for the Linux
operating system, presents to economists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most commercial software, which comes as incomprehensible
``ones'' and ``zeroes,'' open-source programs always include the
source code, written in a programming language like C(plus-plus).
Any programmer can look at the code and change it to fix bugs or
add features. Programmers contribute such patches to the user
community by sending them to a central authority, recognized as the
project leader. That person (or small group) decides which changes
are good enough to become part of the recognized version of the
software that is available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, screens
patches for the core portions of that operating system. There are
thousands of open-source projects, of varying popularity and
complexity. Aside from Linux, some of the most prominent include
the PERL language, Apache server software, the Emacs text editor
and the Sendmail e-mail routing program. Companies like Red Hat
make money not from the code itself, which customers could get
free, but from the products or services bundled with it.
</P>
<P>
   The great advantage of open-source development is that the
process taps thousands of independent minds, making it much easier
to find and repair software bugs. ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs
are shallow,'' writes Eric S. Raymond, a programmer and movement
observer, in ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.'' (The essay is
available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/(tilde)esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral
-bazaar/html.)
</P>
<P>
   Open-source programming thus emulates the marketplace _
Raymond's bazaar _ as well as the scientific peer-review process.
Improvements emerge incrementally, from an open-ended,
decentralized process rather than a central design. The software
becomes more useful and reliable over time.
</P>
<P>
   While its development looks like a marketplace, open-source
software itself is a classic public good. You can use it without
contributing to its maintenance and without paying a cent to all
those programmers who created and improved it.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the economic puzzle. As Josh Lerner of the Harvard
Business School and Jean Tirole of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology ask in a recent paper: ``Why should thousands of
top-notch programmers contribute freely to the provision of a
public good?'' (Titled ``The Simple Economics of Open Source,'' the
paper is available at http://www.people.hbs.edu/jlerner/.)
</P>
<P>
   Lerner says he is skeptical of the argument that says ``this new
technology is so fundamentally different that all the old rules are
off.'' Incentives, the economists believe, are bound to matter. But
if that is the case, the question has ramifications beyond
software, since many public goods depend on tapping the time and
talents of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, open-source programmers often reap some direct
advantages from their improvements. But solving their own problems
has spillover benefits for other people, just as fixing up a
rundown building for your own business makes the neighborhood nicer
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of people work on open-source projects they do not
need for their jobs. One reason is that it is fun and interesting,
as much recreation as work. That is true of many other public-good
endeavors, from planting trees to running charity balls. They are
not all selfless drudgery. Where virtue must be entirely its own
reward, volunteers will be hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   But fun cannot explain everything. After all, many open-source
hackers are already paid to program, and they do not do that for
free. Raymond argues that open-source developers work for status
among other programmers. If you do good work, you become a big
shot. Your name is forever associated with the code you have
contributed, and because the code is open, everyone can see just
what you have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Hackerdom is a ruthless meritocracy, dedicated to winnowing out
bad code and spreading good. A lesson for other voluntary endeavors
is that praising people just for showing up will not attract the
best talent. To be valuable, reputation and recognition have to
signal something significant.
</P>
<P>
   Along these lines, Lerner and Tirole add a pecuniary motive _
one that traditional charities might call ``networking.''
Contributing to open-source projects can enhance a programmer's
career prospects. Especially for someone living and working in an
out-of-the-way place, open-source work can attract the attention of
potential employers or financial backers. The most striking example
is Torvalds, who was a graduate student in Finland when he released
Linux and is now a highly paid executive at a Silicon Valley
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner and Tirole's signaling story assumes that the programmer
already has a portfolio of skills and that open-source development
simply offers a means to display them. But volunteering to work on
difficult problems is also a way of honing new skills _ building
your human capital, as an economist would put it _ and the
open-source community offers feedback that encourages learning.
This, too, is a form of career enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source programmers are an interesting bunch of volunteers
because they are among the most sought-after employees in the
economy, and because their volunteer work has produced lucrative
commercial spinoffs. But software is hardly the first public good
provided through private efforts. While it may sound crass to
consider them, every voluntary endeavor needs incentives for
excellence. The public good often depends on respecting private
gains.

STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON MICROSOFT REMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State and federal officials trying to prepare
remedy proposals in the Microsoft antitrust case have not settled
on a common approach, officials say, and the states are having
trouble agreeing even among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On one critical point, officials say, the 19 states involved now
seem in accord: None is advocating a fundamental breakup of the
company. ``Everybody's in that mode,'' said one official with
knowledge of the negotiations. And there are indications that the
Justice Department concurs.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, the state attorneys general remain at odds on
the approach to take. ``It's like trying to herd a bunch of cats,''
said one official familiar with the states' deliberations. Another,
who has been involved in several recent multistate lawsuits, said,
``There has never been a case where as many people have had as many
different opinions as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the government officials involved in the case _
federal and state _ are not even at the same table, even though
they face a deadline of next week for their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials are locked in private deliberations
over the federal government's remedy proposal, and there have been
no formal meetings between state and federal officials to formulate
a common proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But several state officials have spoken with federal officials
in recent days, and as one official put it, ``There's a great deal
of overlap in our approaches.'' This suggests that the Justice
Department, like the states, is focusing on remedies short of a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   After Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found Microsoft in wide
violation of state and federal antitrust laws on April 3, he told
lawyers for both sides that he wanted to complete the penalty, or
remedy, phase of the case within 60 days. As a result, the federal
and state officials promised to submit their remedy proposals
sometime between Tuesday and Friday of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who will make the final decision on remedies, made it
clear that he would prefer just one proposal from the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   All of the plaintiffs said they believed their position would be
a great deal stronger if they could agree on just one proposal.
Otherwise, ``Microsoft will be able to say, `See, not even all of
the plaintiffs agree on this,''' one official noted. Even if the
two groups submit separate proposals, they are likely to be quite
similar with only a few points of divergence, another official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would be willing to accept two proposals, one
from the states and another from the federal government, if the two
groups cannot agree. And to address the divergent opinions among
the state officials, the judge also said he wanted a proposal
representing a majority view of the states. That could lock out any
attorneys general who insist on a different idea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, some states, caught in difficult and sometimes
contentious negotiations, are threatening to submit their own
proposals if their ideas are not accepted by the others. But other
officials said they believed that was simply a hardball negotiating
tactic, not a real threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge doesn't want that, so I don't think it will
happen,'' one official said. Another said, ``This is phenomenally
difficult and phenomenally complicated, so it's no wonder they're
having a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   While breaking up the company appears to be off the table,
several ideas that go beyond simply trying to modify Microsoft's
behavior are under serious discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, a few attorneys general want to ``fence in''
Microsoft's cash reserve, $17.8 billion, to prevent the company
from using it to buy other software companies and fold their
products into the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Others are interested in forcing Microsoft to spin off Internet
Explorer, the Web browser that was at the center of the suit. The
idea would be to create a new company and recreate competition in
the Web browser business. Microsoft folded Internet Explorer into
the Windows operating system, which means that it is installed
automatically on nearly 90 percent of all computers sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea under discussion is to force Microsoft to make
Office, its suite of application programs, available for other
operating systems, including Linux. Office, including the Word,
Excel and PowerPoint programs, is by far the most widely used
program suite. Its market share exceeds 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this proposal, one official said, would be to
make other operating systems competitive. (Microsoft already makes
Office available for Apple Computer's operating system.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Representatives of most of the states met last Thursday in
Chicago to begin trying to forge a consensus position. While the
state and federal officials have been formulating their proposals
separately thus far, one official said the two sides will try to
schedule a meeting within the next few days with the goal of
submitting one joint proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of core states are doing most of the work. They are
represented by the attorneys general or aides from California,
Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, New York and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people preparing draft orders'' for consideration by
the other states, one official said, adding that ``there's a
high-level agreement'' among the core states. ``We've reached out
to a lot of the others.'' But some attorneys general ``are more
concerned about different aspects than others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One senior state official said he thought it ``more likely than
not'' that the states would eventually agree among themselves,
adding that ``there could be convergence'' with the Justice
Department, ``but that is not at all certain.''

COMMENTARY: WEEK OF MIRACLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time for long thoughts, because this is the week
that joins two related religions in the celebration of miracles.
(Christ's Last Supper took place during Passover; it is said to
have been a Seder, but that's in dispute.)
</P>
<P>
   Christians at Easter find a rebirth of spirituality in the
miraculous resurrection of Christ; Jews at Passover recount to
their children their people's miraculous escape to freedom to
worship one God.
</P>
<P>
   In conducting the Seder at my house, I confess to a creepy
feeling when reading the enumeration of plagues and punishments
visited on Pharaoh's people. Homes of the enslaved Jews were
``passed over'' by an angel of death slaying the firstborn of the
Egyptians, in what seems today to be somewhat harsh punishment by
the All-Merciful.
</P>
<P>
   As others take up the reading, my thoughts drift to the sequel
to that Book of Exodus, the even gorier Book of Esther.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of her drama is familiar: After the Israelites were
driven from Jerusalem, many found refuge in Persia. A beautiful
Jewish girl, concealing her Hebrew name Hadassah, was selected by
Xerxes I to be his queen. When the king's evil vizier, Haman, set a
date for the extermination of all Jews in the kingdom, Esther was
implored by her cousin Mordecai to intercede on her people's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Esther took her life in her hands by approaching the king,
asserting her Jewishness and making the plea. Meanwhile, Mordecai
tipped off the king about Haman's plans to assassinate him and
assume the throne. King Xerxes empowered Esther and her cousin to
get even with the anti-Semites on the day Haman had chosen by lot,
or pur _ hence the feast of Purim.
</P>
<P>
   Get even they did. Not only were Haman and 10 of his sons hanged
on the gallows built to hang Mordecai, but tens of thousands of
other anti-Semites were slain to wipe out empire-wide bigotry. Jews
were welcome in Persia for thousands of years (though 13 are now
suffering persecution in a secret Iranian spy trial).
</P>
<P>
   But the Book of Esther is more than a tale of a heroine's
patriotism. It comes toward the end of the Jewish Bible, and its
admission into the canon was resisted by early rabbis. The secular
narrative deals with the action of Jews in the Diaspora who never
returned to Israel, and it is the only book in the Bible that does
not mention God _ hinting only at unseen help from ``another
place.''
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant exegesis of this controversial work is ``The Dawn:
Political Teachings of the Book of Esther,'' by Yoram Hazony, who
runs the Shalem Center, a conservative think tank in Jerusalem. It
holds that Jews accepted the Torah twice: first in Sinai with Moses
in God's active presence, and many centuries later with Esther, far
from the Promised Land, in God's apparent absence. Esther proved
that ``even in the grim new universe of the dispersion, the most
fearsome evils may yet be challenged and beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther _ wily, courageous, undespairing, loyal _ teaches that
all of us must help each other seize and defend our freedom, just
as the innocent Job taught that we must not look to God for earthly
justice. The seas do not part for us anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But do the stories of our resistance have to be so bloody? These
biblical books do not shrink from the truth; retribution matched
the ferocity of the onslaught. Breaking out of enslavement in
Egypt, or obliterating Haman in Persia or his modern counterpart
during the Holocaust, Jews learned that total war was justifiable
when survival was at stake. And so we teach our children.
</P>
<P>
   In our generation, as people of many religions and races
confront more insidious bigotry, a symbolic reading of Exodus and
Esther teaches the need to respond with nonviolent fierceness. We
should denounce domestic demagogues; stand up to foreign dictators
with moral and economic pressure; threaten terrorists with terrible
retribution; and not let bigots anywhere get away with anything.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the sweet horoseth, but bite fearlessly into the bitter
herb. Distasteful as it may be at dinnertime, it pays to recount
the bloody deeds of the past _ both by attackers and in our defense
_ if such unrelenting annual remembrance girds the world against a
recurrence of evil.

PLASTER CAST MANHOLE COVERS: NOT YOUR AVERAGE LITTLE HOLE ON THE
WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN P. WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Horowitz and Christopher Bailey rolled
into the gas station at the corner of 14th Street and 10th Avenue,
the manager gave them a harried look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, we need to register the imprint of that manhole cover out
by the pump,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That manhole is a new issue, newly manufactured, and we
haven't recorded that model,'' said Horowitz, with the bureaucratic
confidence of a building inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's private property,'' the manager said warily, a bead of
sweat rising on his forehead on this foggy, early spring day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a record of that design up to the studio,''
Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, he and his co-conspirator have roamed the streets
of Manhattan, making plaster casts of more than 70 manhole covers,
which they call urban fossils. Manhole covers seem to have a
strange allure in our culture. They have been lionized in
coffee-table books, rendered on canvas and hung in exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the designer Karim Rashid designed one for New York
in honor of the millennium, and recently the city of Hartford cast
228 of them out of melted-down handguns confiscated by the police.
But the urban fossil collectors were taking their manhole fetish to
a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz led the gas station manager out to an official-looking
white Jeep Cherokee and pulled out two casts he and Bailey had made
earlier on Waverly Place. They were peculiarly beautiful objects,
marked by street trash embedded in the plaster during the casting
process. The manager finally gave in with a wave of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time Bailey is the plaster expert at Horowitz's
restoration and artistic surfaces company, Terra Firma. But he
seems happiest applying his trowel to the filthy New York City
streets. Fortunately, what started as an artistic obsession
recently became a paying job. A Manhattan developer, Capital Real
Estate, is having the two men install a wall inlaid with manhole
covers in the cavernous lobby of an early 20th century factory at
95 Morton Street, soon to be offices. The permanent 14-by-30 foot
wall will extend in an arc across the lobby and through the glass
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw David's manholes, I was amazed,'' said Ilan
Itzhaki, the project manager. ``But I also thought, Am I crazy to
let some artist put manholes in my lobby?''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the three dozen manhole covers that will decorate
the wall are from the 19th and early 20th century, the one at the
gas station was only a few months old and decorated with an almost
pop-art flower design. As if anxious to get the job done before
Itzhaki came to his senses, Bailey spread plaster over the steel
cover. Within minutes the hardening plaster sent wisps of steam
into the 45-degree air.
</P>
<P>
   A homeless man pushing his shopping cart paused to smile but
said nothing. A police car continued up 10th Avenue without
stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Terra Firma studio, above Chelsea Market, Horowitz
and Bailey made negative rubber molds of the plaster casts, and
then bent them to fit a prototype of the wall's elliptical shape.
After casting these curved forms in plaster, the artists sullied
the white finish with detritus they had swept up from the street,
including shattered windshield glass, nails and dirt. One wall of
the studio became a mockup of the final version, which they will
install in the lobby next month, after the construction crews
leave.
</P>
<P>
   The roving pair are already itching to move on. Horowitz said he
had heard there were some interesting fossils in the streets of old
Shanghai. ``Do you think the airlines will let us check some
plaster along with our bags?'' Bailey wanted to know.

AT NEW SANTA CRUZ INN: BED, BREAKFAST AND MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ It looks like a traditional bed and
breakfast, at first. In the grand tradition, it stands proudly
Victorian, with fancy flourishes, quirky nooks and painstakingly
picked 19th-century antiques. But the Compassion Flower Inn also
boasts a large mosaic marijuana leaf at the top of the path to the
front steps, walls stenciled with marijuana leaves in the ``hemp
bedroom'' and an elaborate marijuana mosaic in the tile surrounding
the whirlpool in the lovers' suite.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's first bed and breakfast inn catering to medical
marijuana users, the Compassion Flower Inn is receiving more
attention for its opening than a five-star hotel. The co-owners,
Andrea Tischler and Maria Mallek-Tischler, have spent so much time
fielding calls in recent weeks, that Wednesday, on the day before
their big opening party, they and a small army of volunteers were
still fussing with finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really understand all the attention,'' said Andrea
Tischler, a longtime proponent of the medical use of marijuana for
serious illnesses. ``We had this idea to create something beautiful
and do something for the medical marijuana community. We don't
really think it's such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in tolerant Santa Cruz (population: 52,000), where
socialists become mayor and law enforcement has long looked the
other way when it comes to prosecuting medical marijuana users, the
opening of the Compassion Flower Inn is part of the message the
city is sending the rest of the country: The time has come for the
legal use of medical marijuana. Last week the Santa Cruz City
Council unanimously approved an ordinance making the city the first
in the nation to legalize the production and sale of medical
marijuana without a doctor's prescription, as long as it is sold at
cost or given away.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, which takes effect May 11, is Santa Cruz's
attempt to put in effect Proposition 215, the medical marijuana
initiative which California voters approved in 1996. After the
state initiative passed, then-Attorney General Dan Lungren, as well
as the federal government _ whose position is that any use of
marijuana is illegal _ continued to prosecute those who grew or
used the drug for medicinal purposes, including numerous medical
marijuana clubs in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The medical marijuana movement was essentially shut down through
lawsuits by state and federal officials. That situation has eased
since Bill Lockyer became attorney general last year. Lockyer
appointed a medical marijuana task force, which issued
recommendations for statewide guidelines on accomplishing the goals
of Proposition 215. The guidelines became a state Senate bill,
which was tabled last fall when Gov. Gray Davis threatened to veto
it.
</P>
<P>
   In September a federal appeals court permitted a cannabis club
to continue operating in Oakland, which passed an ordinance in 1998
allowing the use of medicinal marijuana under certain guidelines.
Now, Santa Cruz has gone further _ allowing the medical use of
marijuana with a doctor's note certifying that the patient has a
condition for which marijuana is considered helpful. Those
conditions include AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma,
anorexia, chronic pain, arthritis and spastic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, said Mike Rotkin, a City Council member who helped
draft the ordinance, is that Santa Cruz's law could could serve as
a model for other cities and states that have approved the use of
medical marijuana only to find themselves in conflict with federal
law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Cruz's law protects doctors who have been threatened with
the loss of their licenses by the federal government if they
prescribe medical marijuana. It allows them to write a note stating
the patient suffers from a serious condition that marijuana has
been known to alleviate.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Cruz's law also makes the growing of marijuana contingent
on its being sold for the cost of production or given away so that
the medical marijuana user does not have to resort to buying the
drug for prices sold on the street, said Valerie Corral, director
of the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, a 225-member
medical marijuana collective in Santa Cruz. Corral, who uses
marijuana to alleviate grand mal seizures suffered from epilepsy,
said that members of the collective paid $2 for an eighth of an
ounce of marijuana, compared with $50 to $85 on the street. ``This
ordinance creates a closer, compassionate community in Santa
Cruz,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tischler and Mallek-Tischler became active proponents of the
legal use of marijuana for the seriously ill in the '80s in San
Francisco as friends dying of AIDS found some relief from the drug.
The two helped found a cannabis buyers club in Santa Cruz (one of a
half dozen clubs shut down by the federal government) and lobbied
for the statewide initiative, which passed in Santa Cruz with 76
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken three years to turn a falling down house into the
Compassion Flower Inn, including a full year of Mallek-Tischler's
talents as an artist. She created all the faux marble treatments on
the doors and touches throughout the house, as well as all the
watercolors on the walls, the mosaics in and outside, and the
gardens, with their abundance of passion flowers of different
strains. Tischer, who spent 25 years renovating Victorians in San
Francisco, supervised the project.
</P>
<P>
   Guests in the inn who use medical marijuana must have a doctor's
note. Cigarette smokers, on the other hand, are relegated to the
front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said Andrea Tischler, as she pointed out the green
and cream color scheme of the exterior, ``anyone can stay here.
Anyone with an open heart and mind.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strip ``Manchild in the Promised Land,'' Claude
Brown's acclaimed autobiography of 1950s New York, down to its
heart. There beats a tale of boyhood and manhood, of low life and
high hopes, that could find moving expression as a play.
</P>
<P>
   It works in theory. But in practice, at least in the one-actor
version at the American Place Theater, ``Manchild in the Promised
Land'' is a disappointingly bland, theatrically unimaginative
coming-of-age tale.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's sprawling 1965 book, almost an archetype of American
urban life, tells of Claude's growing up in crime-plagued Harlem
and struggling with race, poverty, sex, family, friendship,
religion and education on his way to a soulful, mature
independence. Focused by its personal narrative voice, ``Manchild''
has an epic reach as it depicts the journeys of a generation of
black families who traded one hard life for another in their move
from the South.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Edward plays Claude and others who populate the landscape
of this ``promised land'' of the urban North. He gives an energetic
performance with a nuanced feel for the rhythms of the book. Among
his characters, the women and drug addicts are particularly
compelling. But perhaps no actor could sustain this adaptation, by
Edward and his director, Wynn Handman. The play faithfully delivers
many units of the book's narrative, but they're not enlivened by a
workable dramatic structure. Edward seems but a storyteller, so
busy squeezing in the text that he can't inhabit his roles with
much depth.
</P>
<P>
   Handman's direction seems loose to a fault. Sometimes Edward
plays both roles in a two-character dialogue; other times he
listens awkwardly to recorded voices delivered with all the flavor
of a rice cake. Sometimes he stalks the stage with a focused,
hip-hop ferocity; other times he wanders around the uninspired set,
a character in search of something to do.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz, the musical movement that helps transform Claude's life,
remains part of this adaptation, but its theatrical opportunities
are reduced to brief recorded snatches and a seldom-used piano.
What a shame.
</P>
<P>
   There are worthy moments in this show, which ends with a sweet
epiphany for the title character: the boy is now a man, and he has
overcome. But without an inventive theatrical substitute for the
book's rich literary texture, this stage ``Manchild'' has not
overcome its unique challenges.

BOSTON AD FIRM TO TAKE OVER CALIFORNIA AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos will take over San
Francisco-based Goldberg Moser O'Neil, the advertising firms said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Communications giant Interpublic Group, which owns both firms,
opted to combine them to ``give us a bigger canvas to paint on,''
said Jack Connors, chief executive of Hill Holliday. He will run
the merged firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us in another big market with all the opportunities
that entails, and it will allow us to go to other, bigger
clients,'' Connors said. ``It makes us a national player.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined firm, GMO/Hill, will have annual billings of about
$1.2 billion and 1,000 employees. Hill Holliday already has offices
in Boston and New York with a large portfolio of financial
services, along with high-tech and health care accounts and plum
accounts like Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   With the San Francisco operations, the firm gains accounts with
fast-growing West Coast companies, including Priceline.com and
Fatbrain.com, an Internet bookstore. The new firm's headquarters
will remain in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic, the second-largest advertising company in the
world, with income last year of $4.6 billion, bought Hill Holiday
in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggested to them early on that they let us take on the San
Francisco office,'' Connors said. ``After having the opportunity to
watch us for a couple years and see what we can do, they decided to
go ahead with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The merged firm will cut some jobs in so-called back-shop
operations such as accounting, most likely in the San Francisco
office, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Goldberg, chairman and chief executive of the San Francisco
agency, will stay on as chairman until the end of the year, when he
plans to retire.

 &HT;    Lawyers paint opposing picture of ex-Louisiana governor as case
nears close
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark

<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The criminal corruption case against one of
the nation's most famous and flamboyant politicians is coming to a
close, and soon jurors will ponder: Who is the real Edwin Edwards?
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors describe the 72-year-old, four-term former governor
as a lying, greedy extortionist who forced riverboat casino
operators to pay him for his influence over the licensing process.
</P>
<P>
   His defense attorney portrays him as a legendary public servant
who is being hounded by a federal case built on scant and
inconclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys in a federal court in Baton Rouge this week distilled
nearly four months of testimony into clear, if conflicting,
conclusions. Closing arguments in the sprawling case _ seven men
are on trial for 33 crimes in connection with five proposed
riverboat casinos _ began Tuesday and are scheduled to end today.
After a break for Easter and Passover, the jury will get
instructions from the court and begin deliberations next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between 1991 and the date of the indictment, a criminal
enterprise operated,'' said U.S. Attorney Jim Letten, one of
several prosecutors to give closing statements. ''These defendants
associated themselves together and participated in the Edwards
enterprise, and each committed at least two crimes. Edwards was the
nucleus; he directed, but stayed in the background.''

<P>
   Prosecutors reviewed highlights from more than 2,000 hours of
FBI surveillance tapes filmed at Edwards' home and office. In many
of the tapes, Edwards and others talk about cash payments _ money
they say is for legal consulting work, but which the government
says are payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legitimate consultants don't get paid in secret,'' U.S.
Attorney Michael Magner said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most dramatic were the attacks on Edwards's
character. Magner said Edwards' testimony last week was ''evasive''
and ''smart-alecky.'' He said the former governor's trademark charm
have helped him escape trouble all his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''That builds arrogance,'' he said. ''What we have here is
greed, what we have here is arrogance, what we have here are
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Letten finished the prosecution's case by comparing Edwards to
''the man behind the curtain'' in ''The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the unmasking of a state governor,'' he said. ''He was
a liar, a thief and a phony. Edwards was that man behind the
curtain, but he wasn't a benign wizard, he was a greedy,
self-serving wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense reacted Wednesday by poking holes in the
government's case. Attorney Dan Small said the secretly recorded
tapes are full of ''gossip, innuendo and lies.'' He pointed out
that nowhere on the tapes is Edwards directly talking about payoffs
from casino operators, nor is there any direct evidence that he
coerced licensing board members to vote his way. He also attacked
the casino operators who pleaded guilty and testified for the
prosecution, saying their cries of being victimized by Edwards and
his co-defendants are ''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another defense attorney, Sonny Garcia, found himself shouting
in the courtroom Wednesday, saying to convict the defendants based
on testimony from people who made a deal with the government would
be ''outrageous.'' He noted that Eddie de Bartolo Jr., former owner
of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty and did not get any jail
time. Robert Guidry, a former casino owner, pleaded guilty and got
to keep more than $100 million in what would have been confiscated
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't convict based on someone who had a motive to lie,''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   John Volz, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Edwards on
unrelated fraud and racketeering charges in 1986 _Edwards was
acquitted - said if the government doesn't convict him this time,
it never will.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this were anybody else, it would be a foregone conclusion
that they're history,'' he said. ''The unknown is Edwards' impact
on the jury. But in this case, it would be a stretch to believe his
interpretation of the taped conversations.''

SWANK'S TRIUMPH HIGHLIGHTS `BOYS DON'T CRY' 

</HEADLINE>

By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
`BOYS DON'T CRY'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This fact-based independent film richly deserved its Oscar bids,
with Hilary Swank winning as best actress and Chloe Sevigny
nominated as best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   Swank plays Teena Brandon, a young lesbian who assumed the guise
of a man _ ``Brandon Teena'' _ while looking for love in rural
Nebraska in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With her short hair and gawky amiability, Swank is persuasive in
playing Brandon as an earnest guy who just wants to be one of the
boys and falls for Sevigny's wayward but good-hearted girl.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy for women to portray men convincingly, but Swank
almost pulls it off _ and the ``almost'' is fitting, since her
character isn't male.
</P>
<P>
   Swank and director-writer Kimberly Pierce insist on calling her
``he,'' but Brandon was physically and legally female, and
acknowledging that brings no dishonor.
</P>
<P>
   Her courageous character and Sevigny's wistful one are tenderly
explored, but the film falters in its depictions of Brandon's male
friends (Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III).
</P>
<P>
   Their shift from loutish carousers to unthinkably cruel and
homophobic murderers and rapists is impossibly abrupt. If it
weren't so painful, grisly and true, it would seem like a bad
dinner-theater version of ``In Cold Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't their story. It's Brandon's, and Swank's
remarkable performance turns this movie into a powerful and
hauntingly memorable experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' also underscores the waste of Hollywood's
customary gloss. It was shot for just $2 million. And by the way,
that's the Dallas area standing in for Nebraska.

<P>
   `MUMFORD'
</P>
<P>
   One of the great unsung gems of late, ``Mumford'' is further
evidence that Lawrence Kasdan is our greatest living director of
ensembles. Take that, Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   The writer-director of ``The Big Chill'' and ``Grand Canyon''
delivers another rewarding human tapestry in this tale of an
idyllic small town where newcomer Mumford (Loren Dean) is wildly
popular as a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to tell him their secrets _ even rival shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble is, the quietly charismatic Mumford isn't a
psychologist. In an era when attention is torn by cell phones and
Web sites, he's simply a guy who listens.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from threats to his identity, the film isn't driven by
plot so much as it is by feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Its interlocking characters are warm, funny, sad and endearing,
from Hope Davis as Mumford's love interest to Alfre Woodard as a
cafe owner and Jason Lee as a young computer tycoon who loves to
skateboard and wishes he could get a date.
</P>
<P>
   Kasdan's script is brilliant, and, as usual, so is his choice of
music. Bob Seger's ``Till It Shines'' never sounded better than it
does in the context of this meaningful and gloriously humanistic
comedy.

`STUART LITTLE'
</P>
<P>
   What fun. A couple (Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie) ``adopt`` a
parentless mouse (the computer-animated Stuart) as a brother for
their little boy (Jonathan Lipnicki).
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second! Adopt a mouse?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but don't knock it, not when E.B. White's story is set in
an otherworld of retro fashions and critters who speak (though,
strangely, not all of them speak to humans).
</P>
<P>
   Voiced by Michael J. Fox, Stuart has a ``poor little me''
neediness that serves the tale's sentiments but not its sense of
fun. For that we have the disdainful family cat voiced by Nathan
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   When his Snowbell beholds Stuart, he hears dinner bells. When
you behold Snowbell's antics, you'll hear your own laughter.
</P>

`HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key to this ``House'' is not to confuse it with another
recent horror remake: the bloated effects orgy ``The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   With its unapologetic exploitation-film bent, ``Hill'' is more
spryly entertaining. It's also a faithful spin on '50s
schlockmaster William Castle's movie about guests invited to spend
a night in a haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   Because of inflation, survivors will get $1 million. In the old
days it was just $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen play the hateful hosts, and Rush
is in fine, hammy form. He relishes taking Vincent Price's role,
from the pencil-thin mustache to his deceptive, dapper charm.
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs and Peter Gallagher are among the guests who stumble
across evil spirits lurking in the ``house,'' which is a towering
former sanitarium where tortures once occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Much mayhem ensues, and the film works well enough in a
slasher-flick mode until surrendering to the same effects nonsense
that burdened ``The Haunting'' from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Look for singer Lisa Loeb in a nice bit as a reporter (``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer's'' camp vamp, James Marsters, plays her
cameraman), as well as Jeffrey Combs of ``Re-Animator fame'' _ or
infamy _ as a ghostly surgeon.

 &HT;    Hamilton will buck NFL bias
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This all sounds familiar. Faster than you can say
Charlie Ward, those who run the NFL propaganda machine are churning
out garbage about another ACC quarterback after he got at least his
fingerprints on a Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   To hear them tell it, Joe Hamilton is too short, too light, too
something. I mean, who cares that he prospered at 5 feet 10 behind
an offensive line at Georgia Tech that was as thick, tall and
talented as many in the pros?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the pros, Hamilton destroyed a Florida State team
last year that was good enough to rank in the AFC East. He
completed 22 of 25 passes for 387 yards and four touchdowns. Later,
Hamilton threw five touchdowns passes against Clemson and four
against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered to the many around the NFL who believe
only in the cookie-cutter approach to building a roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there definitely are a lot of similarities between
Charlie and Joe,'' Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said
Wednesday, recalling a conversation we had six years ago about the
silliness of those who run the machine.
</P>
<P>
   This was back when Ward was picked as college football's top
player after taking Florida State to a national championship. Even
so, those who run the machine said the same things about Ward that
they said about Hamilton, but they also said Ward was too dumb and
too vague.
</P>
<P>
   As for the latter, they said Ward mostly wasn't drafted because
he also was interested in the NBA and wouldn't say he'd definitely
play for an NFL team. You know, just like some guy who left
Stanford, threatened to go to the New York Yankees instead of the
Baltimore Colts and pouted until the Colts used their No. 1 pick in
the draft to ship him elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some guy named Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NFL didn't consider Elway to be a munchkin, he was
given a chance to become rather significant with the Denver
Broncos. If you're a Ward or a Hamilton, you're not given a chance.
Well, not unless a Dungy slips into power.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy couldn't help Ward back then, because Dungy was only the
defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings. As head man of the
Bucs, Dungy gladly chose Hamilton last weekend in the draft's
seventh round after others yawned. In fact, Hamilton will be among
those opening the Bucs' minicamp today for rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll treat Joe like we did (starting quarterback) Shaun King
last year, and that is, we'll have Joe spend his first year
learning our system,'' said Dungy, whose new offensive coordinator,
Les Steckel, likes mobile quarterbacks such as King and Hamilton.
``In Joe's second year, he should be ready to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dungy says it, you can believe it. By drafting Hamilton,
Dungy continued his wonderful habit during his four years in Tampa
of spitting at the NFL's stereotypes. Warrick Dunn. Derrick Brooks.
John Lynch. King. Those are just some of the munchkins that Dungy
hired along the way to taking the Bucs to within a blown
instant-replay call last season of Emerald City.
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know, the Bucs' Emerald City is the Super Bowl.
They'll eventually get there with Hamilton as their latest
munchkin, and those who run the machine will melt on their
broomsticks.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER CITES SALES GAIN, BUT STILL HAS PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ DaimlerChrysler AG reported Wednesday that
sales climbed 17 percent in the last three months, but it paid for
that increase in the form of lower profit margins on both Chrysler
and Mercedes-Benz automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The results indicate that Daimler has yet to overcome the
problem that has bedeviled it since it was formed last year through
the acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   That problem is the unrelenting price competition in the U.S.
car market, which has forced the major manufacturers to offer
buyers generous discounts, rebates and financing deals.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts expect Daimler's position to improve when it
introduces new Chrysler minivans in the fall, they caution that the
new models will not have an impact on the company's financial
results until the last quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted accordingly, sending Daimler shares down 1.5
percent in Frankfurt, to 67.70 euros, or $63.67. On the New York
Stock Exchange, Daimler fell 75 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $63.875.
In the last 12 months, shares of DaimlerChrysler have slumped 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's annual meeting in Berlin on Wednesday,
executives reported that sales increased to $39.2 billion in the
first quarter of this year, a 17 percent jump from the
corresponding period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Net income in the quarter rose 3 percent to $1.62 billion,
helped by changes in German tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Chrysler soared 24 percent to $18.2 billion, while they
rose 7 percent at Mercedes-Benz and at the Smart division, and 11
percent in Daimler's truck and bus companies.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was that the company's overall operating profit
slipped by 3 percent, a decline it attributed to ``intense
competition, especially in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler profit margins decreased to 7.1 percent from 9.5
percent, reducing operating profit by 7 percent, to $1.3 billion.
Margins also slipped slightly for Mercedes passenger cars, to 6
percent from 6.3 percent, but the Mercedes operating profit climbed
11 percent as a result of higher volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they have bought their customers by giving them
lower prices,'' said Rolf Woller, an automobile analyst at
Hypovereinsbank in Munich. ``If you look at operating profit, there
was only one segment that had both higher profits and higher
margins, and that was commercial vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Breitsprecher, an industry analyst at Deutsche Bank,
said the Chrysler results were actually worse than they appeared,
because profit had been affected by the rising exchange value of
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar has appreciated 15 percent and more against the euro
since the first quarter of last year, so Chrysler's profit increase
_ given by Daimler in euros _ incorporates that percent currency
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put together the 7 percent decline in profits'' and the
appreciation of the dollar, Breitsprecher said, ``and profits are
actually down about 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, told the
shareholders meeting Wednesday that the company was poised for
strong growth in both sales and profit. ``The new millennium is off
to a great start for DaimlerChrysler,'' Schrempp said. ``From
today's perspective, we anticipate a further increase in earnings
per share for the full year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to DaimlerChrysler's proposed $2.1 billion
investment in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, which he hopes to
complete by the end of the summer. Under an agreement in principle
reached last month, Daimler would acquire 34 percent of Mitsubishi
and install several executives in the company's top ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp, who received approval Tuesday from Daimler's board to
begin formal negotiations, hopes to repair two of his company's
strategic weaknesses: a presence in Asia and an increased place in
the market for small cars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mercedes nor Chrysler has much strength in small cars,
which are expected to be the fastest-growing market in years to
come. Daimler's most prominent attempt to build small autos, the
Smart car, remains a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp's biggest problem is DaimlerChrysler's share price,
which has slumped badly since the acquisition in contrast to the
broad market's advance.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp said Tuesday that the company would ask stockholders
for approval to buy back shares. Stock buybacks, illegal in Germany
until a few years ago, have become increasingly popular among some
of the the country's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp also wants to introduce a stock option program for
DaimlerChrysler executives that is modeled more closely on American
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans have been well received by institutional investors,
but they anger many traditionalists in Germany who view them as a
crass attempt to enrich top executives at the expense of workers
and ordinary shareholders.

2 STUDIES FIND A FIBER DIET DOES NOT HELP THE COLON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two rigorous studies involving thousands of people have failed
to confirm one of the most widely held beliefs about diet and
health: that eating low-fat, high-fiber foods can reduce the risk
of colon and rectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The studies found that neither eating a low-fat diet with
abundant fiber, much of it from fruits and vegetables, nor eating
extra fiber in the form of wheat bran made any difference in colon
cancer risk. And while some researchers say there is still a chance
that fiber helps prevent colon cancer, others say it is time to
stop telling people that it can.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on colon cancer said the research, led by scientists at
the National Cancer Institute and the University of Arizona, left
them stunned. Colon and rectal cancer is the second-leading cause
of cancer-related death in the United States, after lung cancer,
and is diagnosed in 130,000 Americans a year. Many people hope that
a high-fiber diet will protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally comfortable to believe that low-fat, high-fiber
diets would be beneficial,'' said one public health expert, Dr.
Gilbert S. Omenn, executive vice president for medical affairs at
the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the research.
``Well, here we are. There's not a shred of evidence from these
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer
prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said the surprising
results showed ``the need to rigorously put belief systems to the
test,'' especially ``when you are making recommendations to
literally hundreds of millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts said fiber might nonetheless play another
role long attributed to it: reducing the risk of heart disease and
diabetes. It may also help prevent diverticulitis and
diverticulosis, ailments that entail the formation of sacs in the
wall of the intestine. But some researchers say the latest studies
show that it is time to abandon the idea that fiber can help
prevent colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In both studies, financed by the cancer institute, the subjects
were men and women who had had at least one polyp, a tiny
noncancerous growth, removed from the colon. Such people face a
heightened risk of developing new polyps. And since many colon
cancers start out as polyps, people who have had polyps also face
an increased risk of developing colon cancer. The question was: Can
a special diet protect these people from developing new polyps? If
so, cancer experts reasoned, the diet might protect them from colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One study, lasting four years, involved 2,079 people randomly
assigned to eat low-fat, high-fiber diets with lots of fruits and
vegetables or to follow their usual diets. In the other study,
lasting three years, 1,429 participants were randomly assigned to
eat high-fiber wheat bran cereals or wheat bran fiber bars, or to
eat cereals or bars that looked and tasted the same but were low in
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   The results, being published Thursday in The New England Journal
of Medicine, showed that those who ate the high-fiber diets were no
less likely to develop new polyps over the next few years than
those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pretty stunning articles,'' Omenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said it remained possible that a high-fiber diet could
alter colon cancer risk: the effect might occur either before
polyps develop or very late in the development of colon cancer,
outside the period covered by the studies. But that is only a
hypothesis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. David Hunter, director of the Harvard Center for Cancer
Prevention, said that although ``there is no reason to think there
is any harm associated with cereal fiber,'' it appears that ``it's
not going to prevent colon polyps or cancer, at least in the short
term or over a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis linking fiber to a reduced risk of colon cancer
dates from 1971, with a paper by Dr. Denis P. Burkitt, a British
missionary surgeon who noticed that poor rural Africans had much
less colon cancer than affluent Westerners. The reason, Burkitt
proposed, was diet: the Africans ate much more fiber. Over the
years, evidence supporting the hypothesis steadily mounted.
</P>
<P>
   There was a biological rationale for why it might be so: Fiber
makes the stool more bulky. A bulkier stool will dilute the
cancer-causing substances that are in foods and that are excreted
in the stool, sparing the colon an assault by these chemicals.
Fiber also makes the stool move faster, an effect that should
reduce the time that the colon is in contact with cancer-causing
chemicals in the stool.
</P>
<P>
   Biochemical data added support to the hypothesis: Fiber binds
bile acids, which are chemicals produced by the liver and secreted
into the bowel. Bile acids can damage cells and possibly cause
cancer. The more fat that people eat, the more bile acids that they
secrete. So a low-fat diet might work with a high-fiber one to
protect against colon cancer, researchers thought.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fiber is metabolized in the intestines to produce a
class of short-chain fatty acids that seem to protect against
carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies bolstered the notion. Rodents, fed high
concentrations of carcinogens in laboratory studies, were protected
against colon cancer if they also ate high-fiber diets.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of humans, however, were inconsistent. Some showed that
people who developed colon cancer or polyps ate more fat and less
fiber than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   But several recent studies, one involving 88,000 nurses, failed
to detect any effect of diet on colorectal cancers or polyps. The
problem with these studies was that they were observational: the
subjects chose their diets and were simply observed. It may be that
those who chose high-fiber diets happened to be different in some
other way from those who did not, and that this difference might
have negated diet's effects on their colon cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   In planning the current studies, said Dr. Arthur Schatzkin,
chief of the nutritional epidemiology branch at the cancer
institute, ``we had high expectations and good rationale.'' But, he
said, ``we got absolutely null results.''

</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Schatzkin, who directed the study in which subjects ate either
diets high in fiber, including fruits and vegetables, or their
ordinary diets, said the fiber hypothesis might still turn out to
be true. ``You could say diet works earlier _ before they develop
the first polyp,'' he said. ``Or maybe diet works later in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Walter Willett, head of the department of nutrition at
the Harvard School of Public Health, said the recent observational
studies argued against the notion that the benefit might present
itself earlier or later than the period covered by the latest
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put it all together, the evidence is really quite
strong,'' Willett said. ``You can never prove there is no
association, but we can be pretty confident now that we are not
missing something big.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the second study, Dr. David S. Alberts, director
of cancer prevention at the University of Arizona's Cancer Center,
came to a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've definitely disproved the fiber hypothesis for
colon cancer,'' he said.

<P>
   OTUMBA, Mexico _ The Alfredo del Mazo elementary school has no
running water or phone, and a short circuit knocked out the
electric power for most of this year. Rain blows in on the pupils
through broken classroom windows when thunderstorms sweep across
the cactus outside.
</P>
<P>
   So when Francisco Labastida, the governing party's presidential
candidate, promised in a television commercial to install computers
and offer English classes in every Mexican elementary school,
teachers like Gabriela Garcia were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should start by fixing our windows,'' said
Garcia, who teaches fifth and sixth grades in the dilapidated rural
school in Otumba, 50 miles northeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, educators and parents all across Mexico criticized
Labastida's proposals as an election-year gimmick out of touch with
the basic needs of most schools. Labastida finally retreated,
acknowledging in a speech that the government could help many more
students by patching schoolhouse roofs and improving Spanish
instruction than by introducing computers.
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential election campaigns, governing party
candidates referred to the schools mainly in self-congratulatory
speeches extolling the heroic educational achievements of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which has
ruled Mexico for 71 years. But this year's race has aroused a
genuine debate over education, with opposition candidates
criticizing the top-heavy bureaucracy and inequities of the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Mexicans attend classes for eight years, the
government says, but figures from the Inter-American Development
Bank show that the poorest 30 percent of students attend for just
three. Recognizing that a better educated population is required
for economic progress, all three major candidates have pledged to
increase school spending. But that may not be an easy solution
because President Ernesto Zedillo says that 27 percent of every
government peso already goes to education.
</P>
<P>
   Educators in several towns and villages surrounding Mexico City,
asked about school financing, contended that little of that money
reached their schools. Academics who study Mexico's education
system said extraordinary sums were frittered away by education
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican schools are controlled not by local boards, as in the
United States, but by a federal Education Department, which
mandates a national curriculum, and 31 state departments, which
keep academic records and send inspectors to oversee teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican bureaucracy is dominated by a teachers' union whose
bosses are leaders of Zedillo's governing party, and they
frequently press teachers to campaign for official candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the farm village of Atlatongo, a 90-minute drive north of
Mexico City, the Ramon Beteta elementary school is named for a
prominent governing party politician. The tidy school, shaded by
jacaranda trees, is one of the best in its county, but different
from most American schools. It has no cafeteria, gymnasium, science
lab or lockers. It is just a line of concrete classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Its principal, Jesus Rangel Hernandez, said in an interview that
he wondered where Mexico's relatively high education expenditures
went. The government says it spends $661 on every elementary
student. With 900 students, the school should get nearly $600,000
this year, Rangel reasoned, jotting figures on a paper. The
government provides textbooks and pays his 24 teachers a total of
about $240,000 annually. That should leave at least $300,000 for
maintenance and other supplies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they give us nothing,'' Rangel said. Contributions from
parents underwrite the salaries of a secretary and two janitors.
From his desk he pulled a stack of letters sent over the years to
authorities, requesting money to mend the school's fence, hire a
janitor and buy supplies like chalk and mimeograph ink. ``Its
always the same response: `No money in the budget,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think they do with the money?'' he said.
``They spend it in the PRI's election campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Department bureaucrats and union leaders tried to
strongarm his teachers last year to campaign for the governing
party candidate for state governor, Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waste is extraordinary,'' said Carlos Ornelas, an
education professor who is the author of a standard textbook, ``The
Mexican Education System.'' Many full-time workers for the union
are classified on the payroll as teachers and given government
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 30 to 40 percent of the education budget is just
squandered by the bureaucracy,'' Ornelas said.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Limon Rojas, Mexico's secretary of education,
acknowledged in an interview in his office in Mexico City that his
efforts to trim bureaucratic waste had fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a considerable problem,'' he said. But it was worse, he
said, before a decentralization in 1993 turned control of 115,000
federal schools over to the states. About 85 percent of Mexico's
$23.7 billion education budget for 2000 goes to pay teachers and
bureaucrats, leaving little for anything else, he said. Hundreds of
rural schools with only a handful of students absorb
disproportionate sums in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our spending on physical plant and operational costs is
insufficient, creating the sensation that the money isn't getting
to the schools,'' Limon said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have been reluctant to permit international
scrutiny. After Mexican eighth-graders took part with students from
37 other countries in a 1996 math and science test, the government
embargoed the results. In another international test a year later,
Mexican students scored lower than their peers from Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico can't compete when our scholastic level is below the
countries we do business with,'' Vicente Fox, the center-right
candidate who is Labastida's leading opposition rival, said in a
recent speech. He has pledged to wring more efficiency from the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist who is the other major
opposition candidate, has lambasted authorities for allowing
classrooms to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts praised Labastida's first educational proposal last
year, to lengthen the class schedule to a full day. Currently,
students receive four hours of daily instruction, a total of 800
hours annually, compared with 1,500 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida's promise in January of computers and English
classes set off more fireworks. Party officials applauded. Teachers
grumbled. Journalists ridiculed it as a costly fantasy. This month,
when a Labastida aide visited the Inter-American Dialogue, a
Washington research institute, Jeffrey M. Puryear, an education
expert, questioned the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said most specialists on Latin American education wouldn't
start with computers,'' Puryear said. ``They'd start with
establishing education standards, measuring progress toward meeting
them and building ways to make the school system accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech before hundreds of party officials and
educators, Labastida reiterated his promise of computers and
English instruction, but acknowledged that it would take years to
carry out and that many schools had more pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to raise quality,'' Labastida said. ``There will be
places where the first thing is to put a new roof on classrooms, or
provide bathrooms. Other places may need more teachers or a
library.'' He also said that strengthening instruction in Spanish,
math and Mexican history was more urgent than computers and
English.
</P>
<P>
   At the Alfredo del Mazo school, named for another governing
party politician, the principal, Pablo Gonzalez, said he welcomed
the revision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our students don't even have pencils,'' he said.

BC, DUKE PLAN TWO-YEAR SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After two weeks of negotiating to find dates suitable
for both schools, the Boston College and Duke men's basketball
programs have reached a tentative agreement on a two-year series,
starting January 2001 in Durham, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles will travel to Duke for a game Tuesday, January 16th,
2001. The Blue Devils will return the visit to Conte Forum the
following season _ most likely in January _ but those particulars
have yet to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for our program to have a quality opponent like that
on the schedule,'' said BC athletic director Gene DeFilippo, who
tried various scenarios before coming up with the January date.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan had been for Duke to come to Boston next
season, but the Devils already had an ambitious non-conference road
schedule, with games at Temple, Stanford, and St. John's. While
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski wanted the New England exposure so
forward Matt Christensen, who lives in Belmont, could play a game
near home, he also didn't want to tax his team with too many road
games. Thus the flip-flop of home dates.
</P>
<P>
   The other stumbling block was a Big East rule which stipulates
that all non-conference games from mid-January through the
remainder of the season have to be on national television. After
some negotiating, ESPN agreed to pick up the game, although it
could still be on ESPN 2 as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After moving to the head of the pack in the hunt to replace Paul
Hewitt at Siena, BC associate head coach Tim O'Shea apparently has
fallen behind a new candidate. Lafayette head coach Fran O'Hanlon
interviewed for the position Wednesday and, according to sources,
has become the front-runner, although there is a faction on the
search committee that still favors O'Shea.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon has taken Lafayette to the NCAA tournament the last two
years and has been looking for a chance to jump out of the
non-scholarship Patriot League.
</P>
<P>
   While Siena would not be a quantum leap to a major conference
job, it is in a solid mid-major conference _ the Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference _ and will allow O'Hanlon to recruit
scholarship athletes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   If all things go as expected, an announcement could come as this
week, although O'Hanlon drove home to Easton, Pa., Wednesday night
without getting a definitive word from Siena officials, with whom
he met all day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Hanlon decides that he does not want the job, sources
familiar with the search process feel that O'Shea would receive the
first call over Syracuse assistant Louis Orr, who also interviewed.

MONTREAL YOUTH CHARGED WITH CYBER-ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 15-year-old Montreal youth known online as ``Mafiaboy'' has
been charged with a cyber-attack on CNN's Web site, becoming the
first person arrested after a series of strikes on corporate Web
pages in February.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities said the youth pled not guilty to two
charges of ``mischief to data'' after they raided his home Saturday
and seized at least two computers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, made with the help of the Justice Department and the
FBI, came as the two US agencies face pressure to track down those
responsible for the attacks that crippled e-commerce companies like
Yahoo., Amazon.com, and eBay for hours earlier this year, the
biggest intentional online disruptions to date.
</P>
<P>
   Those attacks, which used relatively simple technical methods,
raised concerns about security standards at dot-com operations. In
messages posted in Internet chat groups, authorities said, Mafiaboy
took credit for several of those intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   So far the charges against the Canadian youth related only to
the attack on CNN, leading skeptics to suggest the authorities have
not apprehended a ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   US and Canadian officials said the arrest at least showed
progress in the investigation. The arrest ``demonstrates our
capacity to track down those who would abuse this remarkable
technology and track them down wherever they may be,'' US Attorney
General Janet Reno told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they may file more charges against the Canadian
suspect or others as they review Mafiaboy's electronic files for
more clues. ``We don't know the specific motivations of Mafiaboy,
but we will try to establish before the courts that he wasn't doing
it just for fun, that he had a criminal intention,'' said Royal
Canadian Mounted Police inspector Yves Roussel at a press
conference in Montreal, Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they couldn't name the youth because of his
age, and didn't know why he chose his online nickname. A Mounted
Police spokesman wouldn't say whether the youth is represented by
an attorney. The youth remains free pending a June 6 hearing in
Montreal juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted the boy could face up to two years in prison on the
``mischief to data'' charges, which were added to Canadian law in
1997. An adult facing similar charges could face as much as ten
years in prison. CNN hasn't specified the cost of damages it
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Mafiaboy concerns attacks he allegedly launched
against server computers maintained by CNN in Atlanta on Feb. 8.
Around 7 p.m. administrators there noticed a flood of signals from
other computers, slowing the site's response time and blocked other
users from accessing it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:45 p.m. programmers had put filter programs in place and
restored the site's performance, though the attacks continued for
several more hours, said a company spokesman. He said network
adminstrators weren't sure exactly how many users encountered
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A break in the case came the following day when a system
adminstrator at the University of California at Santa Barbara
noticed a computer that was apparently used as a conduit for the
attack, and spoke with CNN and FBI officials.
</P>
<P>
   The administrator, Kevin Schmidt, said in an interview Wednesday
that some of the traffic originated in Canada, but that he had been
asked by the FBI not to discuss exactly where. Schmidt said the
unauthorized traffic didn't seem to relate to the attacks on other
corporate Web sites, however, and that the methods used by the
intruder _ apparently Mafiaboy _ weren't advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw nothing here that was at all sophisticated,'' Schmidt
said. ``This is like a juvenile putting graffiti on the local high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Schmidt's tips, computer logs and
other material helped them determine Mafiaboy's residence by Feb.
15. By the end of the month they had also learned his identity. He
was arrested April 15. Citing their ongoing investigation,
officials wouldn't discuss the reasons for the delay in the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   According to a summary of the case prepared by Canadian
officials, the boy was released to his parents Monday afternoon on
condition that he remain at home most of the time and any refrain
from any contact with ``three of his best friends,'' who
authorities also wouldn't identify.
</P>
<P>
   The youth was also prohibited from using a computer except at
school. At school, he ``must be under direct and constant
supervision of a teacher or another supervisor,'' according to the
summary.

AT SITE OF OKLAHOMA BOMBING, A MEMORIAL IS DEDICATED AND TEARS ARE
SHED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The moment came, as it does every morning, when
the clock moved from 9:01 to 9:02, but unlike every morning, the
changing minute brought silence here Wednesday. Silence up the
gentle slope of Fifth Street, where thousands of people stared down
at a huge bronze gate that stood like an entrance to a tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the gate lay the new Oklahoma City National Memorial,
built on the grounds of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building,
where five years ago at that minute on this day a yellow Ryder
truck exploded. The bombing of the federal office building took 168
lives, and now those who had gathered in their memory offered 168
seconds of silence.
</P>
<P>
   A police radio crackled. A young mother shushed her baby.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there came church bells and four fighter jets roaring
out of the gray skies overhead. Then came the names, all 168, each
read slowly over a microphone by survivors of the blast as well as
others. The crowd on Fifth Street began to stir. With each name, a
family rose, and then another and another, all of them moving
slowly toward the gate to enter the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's hard,'' said Bobby Altstatt, a police chaplain
wearing dark sunglasses as he greeted some of the family members
passing by. ``It's why these glasses are on. I don't want to be
seen crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, at the official dedication of the Oklahoma
City National Memorial, President Clinton led elected officials in
paying tribute to the victims of the worst act of domestic
terrorism in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never have all the answers for what happened here,''
Clinton said. ``But as we continue our journey toward
understanding, one truth is clear: What was meant to break us has
made you stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who visited here four days after the bombing, said the
memorial would serve as a reminder to all Americans of the tragedy
that occurred on April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are still days when the old anger wells up inside
you,'' the president said, ``and still days when tears fill your
eyes, when you feel your heart will break. On those days in the
future, I hope you can come here and find solace here, in the
memory of your loved ones and the honor of your fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning gathering had been described as the ``private''
dedication for survivors, rescuers and families of the victims. And
even with cameras televising the event across the country, it still
somehow seemed private, even intimate.
</P>
<P>
   On every anniversary of the bombing, people have gathered to
honor the dead, so in that regard this day was no different. But in
years past there was only a chain-link fence here. The fence became
a shrine, a place where visitors left letters and photographs, or
teddy bears for the 19 children killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, family members waited to pass through the bronze gate to a
field below with 168 stone chairs, each engraved with the name of a
victim. One man carried a bouquet and a Cookie Monster doll. A
young woman carried a yellow wreath encircling a photograph of a
smiling young man, a husband or a brother lost.
</P>
<P>
   Altstatt stood and watched. In the weeks after the bombing, he
helped identify victims and console grieving families. He also
counseled people whose loved ones remained missing for weeks in the
rubble, including the family of Christy Rosas. She had worked on
the third floor, and her body was not found until the building was
imploded about a month after the bombing. When searchers later
found Rosas, Altstatt was there.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday morning, as Christy Rosas' family waited to enter
the memorial, Altstatt reached over to say hello to her husband.
They live within a mile of one another but had been strangers until
the bombing. Now, he said he considered them as family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know how some of these folks can do this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the gate, after the ceremony, families stood beside the
empty stone chairs. Police officers, firefighters and other
rescuers stood in formation beside the long, dark reflecting pool
built where Fifth Street once ran in front of the building. The
pool divides the field of chairs from the old elm that survived the
blast, now known as the Survivors' Tree. Many people walking on the
memorial's new grass carried small pots with seedlings from the
tree to be planted across Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Heald Schwab, surrounded by her four children, stood and
remembered. She does not know why, but she was one of the lucky
ones. She had worked on the eighth floor, and she lost her right
eye in the explosion. Plastic surgery repaired the damage from the
200 stitches to her face. But that day she walked out of the
building, and on Wednesday morning she could only cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very peaceful,'' Schwab said. ``Now we go forward. Now
that we know this is here, we cannot ever forget; we don't even
want to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled as her children waited to leave. When asked, she
admitted she would probably not return often. This day was
important, but hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she said softly. ``I can't. It took me quite a while
before I could even drive by. But I've worked through that. I
hope.''

 &HT;    Davidians remember those who died during 1993 siege
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Branch Davidians celebrated the return of a church
to Mount Carmel on Wednesday and remembered the 76 members who died
after a fire engulfed their building seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They also received a visit from a friend of their late leader,
David Koresh. Showing up unexpectedly was Robert Rodriguez, the
former undercover agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, who became friends with the Davidians and warned his
superiors that the group had learned they were planning a raid.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people turned out for a five-hour event that
featured the ringing of a bell for those who died and Davidians
being handed the keys to a church built by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian Clive Doyle spoke briefly to reporters before the
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deterioration and eroding of our rights seems to go on no
matter who is in power,'' Doyle said. ``What happened here was an
eye-opener to a lot of people as to how bad it's gotten. It's a
shame we continually have to remember this event, but the way it's
been distorted and people go on suffering, I think it's necessary
to go on bringing this up to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors came from as far as Michigan and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   John Whiting was one of several visitors from Michigan. He's the
chaplain of the 20th Michigan Militia Brigade. He and other militia
members wore camouflage fatigues and black berets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make a statement that this is not going to happen
again,'' Whiting said. ``If it does, there will be an immediate
retaliation from the Michigan militia. They don't want to try it
again. There's also another reason we're out here. We wanted to
apologize to these people for sitting at home on our duffs while
this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending the dedication and memorial services were prominent
Davidians such as Bonnie Haldeman, Koresh's mother, Catherine
Matteson, Edna Doyle, Sheila Martin and David Thibodeau, one of
nine Davidians who survived the siege. Thibodeau and his band
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers included Ramsey Clark, former U.S. attorney general,
and David Hardy, an Arizona attorney who forced the government to
release classified information on the Davidian siege. Also in
attendance was Alex Jones, the radio host from Austin who led the
drive to build the Davidians a new church, which is substantially
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, as he entered the church, criticized the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no coincidence that Bill Clinton and Janet Reno are in
Oklahoma City today for a memorial service there,'' said Clark, who
is representing several Davidians suing the government. ``They're
not here, and they caused this. What about their victims? You don't
hear a word about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones told how the church-building campaign was launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven months ago, I sat down with Clive and said, `Why don't
we build a church?''' Jones said. ``He said, `I've heard people
talk about building one. You want to try, go ahead.' We had people
from every state here helping. God bless you all. It shows that the
American people stood up and said, `We don't believe the lies. We
researched it ourselves, and what happened at Mount Carmel was
wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones handed Doyle the keys to the church, whose construction
was financed by more than $93,000 in donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apostle Paul tried to get the attention of the Jewish
Christians and the gentile Christians that the temple was more
important than the building,'' said Doyle, choking up. ``That is
us. Government can come and destroy the building. But as long as
there is one child of God, they cannot destroy the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Forbes and his 3-year-old son Casey were among those
listening in the audience. The railroad engineer drove from
Newberry, Fla., for the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more evidence that comes out, the clearer it is that what
happened here was wrong,'' Forbes said. ``I felt a personal
obligation to be here today. Every American sat and watched those
women and children gassed and burned and did nothing. I guess
that's why I'm here, to say it won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire on April 19, 1993, started several hours after the FBI
began firing tear gas into Mount Carmel. Surviving Davidians and
relatives of those who died filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against
the U.S. government. The government argues the deaths of the
Davidians, whether caused by fire or gunshot wounds, came by their
own hand. A trial is set for June 19.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez arrived early in the afternoon, riding up the long
gravel drive to the new church on a purple Harley-Davidson Electra
Glide. The media and the public quickly encircled the former ATF
agent, who wore boots, black chaps, a black vest (the words ``ATF
Special Agent'' stitched on it), dark sunglasses and a bandana.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a house across Double E Ranch Road for months in
1992-93 while posing as a college student, a ruse that Davidians
said they never believed. He befriended the Davidians, whom the ATF
was after for possessing automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   During the siege, Koresh asked to speak to Rodriguez, whom he
trusted. The FBI refused Koresh's request.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, however, was greeted with hostility on his return to
Mount Carmel, especially when he defended his former agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, something would have happened if nothing had
been done,'' Rodriguez said, speaking calmly but pressed against a
TV van by the growing crowd, which did not include any Davidians.
``Eventually, there would have been people killed within this area
because he (Koresh) needed to fulfill his prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Koresh prophesied that the government would come after him,
although he taught that it would be because he had multiple wives.
</P>
<P>
   A man asked who shot first during the 1993 raid, which resulted
in four ATF agents and five Branch Davidians being shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not shoot first,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they didn't shoot first,'' Jones said, working his way
through the crowd. ``They did shoot first. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was asked if the Davidians were ``gearing up for war''
when he left Mount Carmel on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, everything was calm,'' he said. ``Once I left,
anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began closing in on Rodriguez, who edged away, asking
several people, ``May I please leave?'' He stopped when someone
asked loudly why he was at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because of my people,'' Rodriguez said, stopping. ``A
lot of things happened here. A lot of things happened to me. It
changed my life. It will be with me for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was tense, but those in the crowd upset with
Rodriguez's appearance settled for verbal put-downs. A man helping
provide security walked by and said, ``Pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones urged the crowd to come inside the church and listen to
the day's speakers ``instead of this distraction sent here by the
feds.'' A third man eyed Rodriguez's motorcycle and said, ``I
didn't know jack-booted thugs earned that much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people at Mount Carmel, though, were like David Hall of
Fort Worth. They didn't come to confront anyone, just to remember
those who died seven years ago. Hall, a member of the Associated
Conservatives of Texas, has been to every one of the memorials at
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Hall always brings a 3,000-pound replica of the Liberty Bell,
crack and all, and rings it to honor the dead. After each toll,
Doyle, inside the church, tearfully read the names and ages of the
dead, including his 18-year-old daughter, Shari.
</P>
<P>
   When Hall finished ringing the bell, he stood wistfully by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stand here and hear the resonance, it really makes
you solemn,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those lives are worth so much more than the ringing of a
bell.''

BOY MUST STAY IN US DURING APPEALS PROCESS, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal appeals court ignited a wildfire of
celebration among Cuban Americans here Wednesday by extending a
legal ban on Elian Gonzalez leaving this country and chiding the
federal government for its handling of the 6-year-old boy's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gonzalez family continues to believe in the laws of the
United States and we will continue to pray so ... he may be able to
remain where his mother wanted him to be, in a country of
freedom,'' Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro, said a few hours after an
announcement of the court's decision set off cheers, screams of
``Liberty,'' and a sense of euphoria in the crowd assembled outside
the elder Gonzalez' home and throughout the Cuban American
community in the Little Havana section of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Janet Reno said the ruling did not preclude
returning the boy to his father in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   While the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta did not
provide Elian's relatives with a final victory, and while they
could ultimately lose their fight to prevent his return to Cuba,
Wednesday's ruling markedly improved the family's legal prospects.
In the process, it set the stage for a potentially
precedent-setting change in US immigration procedures and
effectively increased the pressure on Reno to take dramatic action
if she wants to make good on her her vow to reunite Elian with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, a three-judge panel from the 11th Circuit said
everyone seeking asylum, regardless of their age, deserves to be
heard in court. This country's laws don't specify how old an asylum
applicant must be, but in practice, young children are assumed to
be incompetent to make such critical judgments for themselves and
are routinely returned to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this regard, not taking Elian's wishes into account as
his Miami relatives have insisted they should be, that the judges
in Atlanta leveled their harshest criticism at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the record, plaintiff _ although a young child _
has expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba,'' they wrote
in their decision, which the government is entitled to appeal. ``It
appears that never have INS officials attempted to interview
plaintiff about his own wishes. It is not clear that the INS, in
finding plaintiff's father to be the only proper representative,
considered all of the relevant factors _ particularly the child's
separate and independent interests in seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The three judges, who had granted Elian's family a temporary
injunction last Thursday, Wednesday ordered Elian to stay in this
country at least until the full appeals court can hear his case
during the week of May 12. But they pointedly did not grant the
Justice Department's request for an order to immediately turn over
Elian to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did they specify where the boy should live, however, as
long as he does not leave the country. And that apparently
deliberate void in guidance left Reno -- who clearly had hoped for
a favorable ruling to give her legal cover for seizing the boy, if
necessary -- standing unshielded as she now has to decide whether
to order Elian's forcible removal from Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, where she traveled with a Clinton
administration delegation for ceremonies marking the anniversary of
the worst domestic terrorism in US history, the attorney general
sounded disappointed by the court decision but said she would abide
by it. She also pointed out that the Justice Department and Juan
Gonzalez had already agreed in writing to keep Elian in the United
States while the judicial process unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to ... take the course of action that we deem
appropriate under the circumstances,'' Reno added, hinting that a
federal effort to gain physical custody of Elian may soon be
coming.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Washington earlier in the day, she
offered an even more direct warning of impending action. ``There
may come a time when there is no other alternative,'' she responded
when asked whether she would order Elian's seizure if his Miami
relatives did not relinquish control over him voluntarily. ``But
we've got to do it in a careful, thoughtful way.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Reno mounted not only as a result of the court's
decision in favor of Elian's Miami relatives, but also because of
the response it triggered from the attorney for Juan Gonzalez.
Sounding angry, Greg Craig told reporters in Washington that it
would be ``unconscionable'' for the Justice Department ``to wait
another moment'' before reuniting father and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call on the US government to take immediate action,'' said
Craig, who added that Wednesday's ruling places the responsibility
for quick action ``squarely on the shoulders of the attorney
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that Elian's well-being had deteriorated and would
continue to do so if he remains in Lazaro Gonzalez' home, Craig
said that if the boy is not removed, the US government ``will bear
responsibility for the harm that continues to be inflicted on Juan
Miguel and his beloved son.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has maintained from the start that
Elian's disposition is an immigration matter that could legally be
decided solely by the INS without any court participation. US
officials have made no secret of the fact that they viewed this
case as so explosive, however, that they preferred to be seen as
doing everything possible to avoid a confrontation with the Cuban
exile community in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Reno took the extraordinary step of
flying to Miami herself last week to negotiate a resolution that
might be acceptable to all sides. After a late-night meeting at
which she failed to accomplish that, the government stripped the
Miami relatives of legal custody over Elian and ordered Lazaro
Gonzalez to deliver his greatnephew to an airport for transport to
his father -- an order that was very publicly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities subsequently released a letter from a
pediatrician in which he suggested that Elian was suffering such
severe emotional trauma from living in his relatives' home that he
should be ``rescued'' as soon as possible. The authorities also
demeaned the Miami family's claim to the boy, describing them as
``distant'' relatives who had little if any legal standing compared
to a father who had been an active participant in raising his son.
</P>
<P>
   On this count, too, Wednesday's 16-page decision takes the
Justice Department to task and raises questions about future
instances -- say, in cases of child slavery or when girls claim a
fear of ritual genital mutilation if they are returned to their
parents in Africa -- in which children's interests or desires might
clash with a parent's assumed or requested right to repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   The judges in Atlanta said Lazaro Gonzalez does indeed have a
legitimate stake because he is Elian's ``blood relative'' and his
interests ``to say the least, are not obviously hostile to the
plaintiff's interests.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He moves among awestruck pilgrims in the Holy Land,
but this priest from Texas has little time or inclination for
starry-eyed devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's preparing for a papal visit, as he did last month,
or for Easter, the Rev. Athanasius Macora(cq) has to stay focused
on the details.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old priest, an American from Austin, is one of a
group of Franciscans who keep a centuries-old watch over Catholic
access to holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Within his jurisdiction are the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
where Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe Jesus was crucified
and resurrected, and Bethlehem's Basilica of the Nativity, where it
is believed Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   The churches have been the subject of legendary quarreling
between the Christian communities who share them _ primarily
Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox. Access is allotted
through a ``status quo'' agreement imposed by Ottoman rulers in
1852.
</P>
<P>
   Macora handles day-to-day negotiations on status quo issues for
the Franciscan entity called ``The Custody of the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned the post in late 1998 and notes with some
trepidation that his predecessor held it for 45 years. There's a
lot at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us wants to be the one who drops the ball,'' Macora
says. ``Nobody wants to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Crimean War, a famously bloody European affair
of the mid-1800s, started after Catholics and Greek Orthodox
disputed the placement of a star on the floor of the Basilica of
the Nativity.
</P>
<P>
   So, Macora maintains his polite, just-doing-my-job demeanor even
in a land that inspires others to hyperbole or religious zealotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impressive, but I'm kind of caught up in the nuts and
bolts of it,'' he says. ``For us, it's business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his duties, he reviews alterations to the church, making
sure the other churches don't try to expand their rights and that
Catholics pay for their share of the upkeep, thereby maintaining a
claim to ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he arranged written permission from the Orthodox
churches for the microphones and television wiring that broadcast
the Holy Sepulcher mass of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   After Easter is over, he will take in a few days of prayer and
silence in a monastery. Until then, the onslaught of worshippers
will keep the priest too busy for much prayer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is to defend the rights of the Catholic Church,'' he
says. ``That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent walk in the sprawling Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
Macora views hundreds of tourists and pilgrims from Italy, Turkey,
North America and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   They stoop to kiss the anointing stone, where it is believed
Jesus was prepared for entombment. They climb the steep steps to
Calvary, the rocky point of the crucifixion. They line up to get
into the tomb chamber, empty as testimony to Jesus' resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just come down here to make sure everything is OK,'' he
says, wearing the brown robe of his Franciscan order and
maintaining a Joe Friday-candor.
</P>
<P>
   When two Italian women ask him to bless souvenir rosary beads,
he obliges, saying, ``That's what we're here for.''
</P>
<P>
   With prodding, he admits that there is something special about
this work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I am very inspired by the pilgrims,'' he says.
``They come with a lot of faith, and for somebody that's jaded like
me _ you can use that word _ it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Awestruck pilgrims tell him they will renew their faith and
start praying again. Some send him letters of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was ``impressed'' last month when he saw Pope John
Paul II, only the second Catholic pope in history to visit the
church. He won't say if he reacted, as many others, with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I want to go on the record with that,'' he says.
``You know, big boys don't cry.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Macora was born Stephen Macora on an air base in Great Britain.
His father, Stanley, was in the U.S. Air Force. They moved every
three years until going to Austin when Macora was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There, he went to Crockett High School and then studied botany
at the University of Texas. His father retired from the air force
and still lives in Austin with his wife, Esther.
</P>
<P>
   Macora has four younger siblings, including a sister, Mary
Birozes(cq), in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Raised Roman Catholic, Macora says he considered the priesthood
during college and answered the calling shortly after graduation.
He says he loved UT, but was ``unsatisfied'' by the secular life.
</P>
<P>
   He studied in Jerusalem and spent a year living in the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher, participating in the daily masses that both
celebrate Jesus and help maintain Catholic access there.
</P>
<P>
   After three years at a parish in Damascus, Syria, he was tapped
to return to Jerusalem as the ``delegate for the holy places and
status quo.'' Technically, he represents the region's top
Franciscan official on a committee of Franciscans who oversee the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which was built in the 4th
Century and then destroyed and rebuilt repeatedly since, the status
quo outlines who owns every level, alcove and altar.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim family, seen as neutral by the Christians, keeps the
foot-long iron key to the only door.
</P>
<P>
   In one shared area, the Catholics, Armenians and Greeks
alternate who will clean the area every week. Cleaning is an act of
ownership and, if someone went a few cycles without cleaning,
another church might edge them out.
</P>
<P>
   But, the churches work together more now than ever. Evidence of
that could be seen in the ``excellent'' cooperation that Macora
says he received for the papal mass.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge is Easter. Thousands of Catholics will come,
followed by thousands of Greek Orthodox, who celebrate Easter a few
days after the western date.
</P>
<P>
   It will bring an ``overlapping of pilgrims'' that Macora calls
``chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he notes, the mix inside the church is a microcosm for
religious relations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only solution,'' he says, ``is to have a wide tolerance
for other peoples' rights.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The question has intrigued historians for 200 years. Was
the disease-riddled little boy who died in 1795 after years alone
in a prison cell really the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette?
</P>
<P>
   Or had royalists managed, at the height of the French
Revolution, to spirit the young heir from harm after his parents
were sent to the guillotine?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, two scientists said they could offer proof that the
10-year-old was indeed Louis XVII. He had endured two years in
Temple prison, where he was left unattended and in the dark for
long stretches, with skin tumors, scabies and increasing signs of
madness.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, after examining all that remains of the boy _ a
dried heart _ said they had been able to match the boy's DNA with
that of other members of the royal family, including DNA taken from
a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of 200 years of uncertainty,'' said Philippe
Delorme, a historian who had pressed for the test and helped
announced the results. ``It is a very exciting day for historians.
It puts to an end a mystery that has absorbed so many of us. Now we
have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, more than 500 books have been written about
the young dauphin, and many theories emerged about his possible
escape and presumed exile.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mark Twain could not resist tweaking the issue. In ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' Huck tells Tom about ``the little
boy dolphin'' who might have been king but was shut up in jail and
may have died there, though others said the boy might have gotten
away to America. In 1905, speculation on the subject was so intense
that a monthly review was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the young prince's death, rumors circulated that
he had been spirited out in a bathtub and that the dead boy was a
substitute. Would-be heirs have popped up all over Europe claiming
to be the true descendants of the Bourbon line.
</P>
<P>
   One such man, Charles-Guillaume Naundorff, was so convincing
that the government of the Netherlands allowed him to be buried
there in 1845 under a tombstone indicating he was the true heir to
the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the royal family say dozens more claim to be direct
descendants, though few have been as public with their claims.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the scientists said they were all impostors. They
said they had been able to extract three samples of mitochondrial
DNA from the heart and compare them with samples from locks of hair
taken from Marie Antoinette, two of her sisters and samples from
two living maternal relatives, Queen Anna of Romania and her
brother Andre. In all cases, they said, they had found
``identical'' sequences.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, both specialists in human genetics, Jean-Jacques
Cassiman of the University of Louvain in Belgium and Bernd
Brinckmann of the University of Muenster in Germany, said they had
found enough matching DNA to determine that Marie Antoinette was
the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new evidence will end all conspiracy theories in the
rarified world of royal intrigue remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the news conference announcing the results, some members
of the audience questioned whether the scientists could be
considered truly independent, given that they were paid by the
royal family trust. Others speculated whether the dead boy might
not have been another son of Marie Antoinette that no one knew
about.
</P>
<P>
   But royal-gazing does not really interest the French much. The
French Revolution and its many aftershocks wiped out a great many
members of the royal family and stripped most of their wealth.
Since the last reigning king, Louis-Philippe, was removed from
office in the revolution of 1848, there has been much feuding over
who is the real heir to the throne, but very little effort to
restore anyone to it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, the duke of Beauffremont, who heads the Memorial
of France at St.-Denis, the private organization that oversees the
royal graves and paid for the DNA tests, said that he was grateful
that science had provided an answer and that he would now push for
a proper burial for the boy's remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see him placed between his mother and his
father, which would be very fitting,'' the duke said. He said last
December that he had decided to have the heart tested because the
question of the boy's death just would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman was at first unsure that any DNA testing could be
accomplished because the heart was in such bad shape. The story of
how it survived is a crazy saga that can hardly be a scientist's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   It was never meant to be preserved. But one of the doctors
present at the child's autopsy decided to keep it as a memento. The
doctor, Philippe-Jean Pelletan, stole it and wrapped it in his
handkerchief when no one was looking. At home, he put it in a glass
vial filled with alcohol, but the liquid evaporated and the heart
dried up, hard as a stone. A few years later, one of the doctor's
assistants stole it. When he died, his widow returned it to the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the monarchy was briefly returned to power in 1815,
the doctor apparently tried to return the heart to Louis XVIII, who
wanted nothing to do with it. So, just before Pelletan died, he
decided to entrust it to the archbishop of Paris. But in 1831 the
archbishop's palace came under attack during civil disorders, and a
printer named Lescroart tried to save the relic and the paperwork
that proved its authenticity in the hopes of giving it back to the
doctor's son for safekeeping. But he got caught in the mayhem, and
as he wrestled with a national guardsman, the crystal urn
containing the heart was smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, when all was quiet, Lescroart came back with
Pelletan's son and they found the heart lying among shards of
glass, some engraved with royal fleurs-de-lis. The son kept the
heart until his death. In his will, he bequeathed it to members of
one of the branches of France's royal family, who kept it in their
chateau for more than eight decades. In 1975, it was put into the
custody of the Memorial for France at St.-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their doubts, both Cassiman and Brinckmann were able
to get an adequate sample of DNA by cutting tiny slices from the
heart with razor blades. The DNA samples were not perfect, both
scientists said, but they were complete enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman has tried before to answer royal mysteries. In 1998, he
tried to compare the DNA from Naundorff to that from Marie
Antoinette's hair and her sister's hair found in a locket belonging
to their mother. In his findings in the European Journal of Human
Genetics, he said it was highly unlikely Naundorff was related to
the young queen, whose Austrian blood line and fancy ways helped
ignite the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Delorme, who has written two books on the young prince's life,
said the DNA results were a form of justice for the child. ``Until
now, his death was stolen,'' he said. ``It was not admitted that he
died in such a horrible way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He moves among awestruck pilgrims in the Holy Land,
but this priest from Texas has little time or inclination for
starry-eyed devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's preparing for a papal visit, as he did last month,
or for Easter, the Rev. Athanasius Macora(cq) has to stay focused
on the details.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old priest, an American from Austin, is one of a
group of Franciscans who keep a centuries-old watch over Catholic
access to holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Within his jurisdiction are the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
where Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe Jesus was crucified
and resurrected, and Bethlehem's Basilica of the Nativity, where it
is believed Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   The churches have been the subject of legendary quarreling
between the Christian communities who share them _ primarily
Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox. Access is allotted
through a ``status quo'' agreement imposed by Ottoman rulers in
1852.
</P>
<P>
   Macora handles day-to-day negotiations on status quo issues for
the Franciscan entity called ``The Custody of the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned the post in late 1998 and notes with some
trepidation that his predecessor held it for 45 years. There's a
lot at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us wants to be the one who drops the ball,'' Macora
says. ``Nobody wants to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Crimean War, a famously bloody European affair
of the mid-1800s, started after Catholics and Greek Orthodox
disputed the placement of a star on the floor of the Basilica of
the Nativity.
</P>
<P>
   So, Macora maintains his polite, just-doing-my-job demeanor even
in a land that inspires others to hyperbole or religious zealotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impressive, but I'm kind of caught up in the nuts and
bolts of it,'' he says. ``For us, it's business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his duties, he reviews alterations to the church, making
sure the other churches don't try to expand their rights and that
Catholics pay for their share of the upkeep, thereby maintaining a
claim to ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he arranged written permission from the Orthodox
churches for the microphones and television wiring that broadcast
the Holy Sepulcher mass of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   After Easter is over, he will take in a few days of prayer and
silence in a monastery. Until then, the onslaught of worshippers
will keep the priest too busy for much prayer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is to defend the rights of the Catholic Church,'' he
says. ``That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent walk in the sprawling Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
Macora views hundreds of tourists and pilgrims from Italy, Turkey,
North America and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   They stoop to kiss the anointing stone, where it is believed
Jesus was prepared for entombment. They climb the steep steps to
Calvary, the rocky point of the crucifixion. They line up to get
into the tomb chamber, empty as testimony to Jesus' resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just come down here to make sure everything is OK,'' he
says, wearing the brown robe of his Franciscan order and
maintaining a Joe Friday-candor.
</P>
<P>
   When two Italian women ask him to bless souvenir rosary beads,
he obliges, saying, ``That's what we're here for.''
</P>
<P>
   With prodding, he admits that there is something special about
this work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I am very inspired by the pilgrims,'' he says.
``They come with a lot of faith, and for somebody that's jaded like
me _ you can use that word _ it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Awestruck pilgrims tell him they will renew their faith and
start praying again. Some send him letters of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was ``impressed'' last month when he saw Pope John
Paul II, only the second Catholic pope in history to visit the
church. He won't say if he reacted, as many others, with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I want to go on the record with that,'' he says.
``You know, big boys don't cry.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Macora was born Stephen Macora on an air base in Great Britain.
His father, Stanley, was in the U.S. Air Force. They moved every
three years until going to Austin when Macora was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There, he went to Crockett High School and then studied botany
at the University of Texas. His father retired from the air force
and still lives in Austin with his wife, Esther.
</P>
<P>
   Macora has four younger siblings, including a sister, Mary
Birozes(cq), in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Raised Roman Catholic, Macora says he considered the priesthood
during college and answered the calling shortly after graduation.
He says he loved UT, but was ``unsatisfied'' by the secular life.
</P>
<P>
   He studied in Jerusalem and spent a year living in the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher, participating in the daily masses that both
celebrate Jesus and help maintain Catholic access there.
</P>
<P>
   After three years at a parish in Damascus, Syria, he was tapped
to return to Jerusalem as the ``delegate for the holy places and
status quo.'' Technically, he represents the region's top
Franciscan official on a committee of Franciscans who oversee the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which was built in the 4th
Century and then destroyed and rebuilt repeatedly since, the status
quo outlines who owns every level, alcove and altar.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim family, seen as neutral by the Christians, keeps the
foot-long iron key to the only door.
</P>
<P>
   In one shared area, the Catholics, Armenians and Greeks
alternate who will clean the area every week. Cleaning is an act of
ownership and, if someone went a few cycles without cleaning,
another church might edge them out.
</P>
<P>
   But, the churches work together more now than ever. Evidence of
that could be seen in the ``excellent'' cooperation that Macora
says he received for the papal mass.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge is Easter. Thousands of Catholics will come,
followed by thousands of Greek Orthodox, who celebrate Easter a few
days after the western date.
</P>
<P>
   It will bring an ``overlapping of pilgrims'' that Macora calls
``chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he notes, the mix inside the church is a microcosm for
religious relations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only solution,'' he says, ``is to have a wide tolerance
for other peoples' rights.''

RENO PATIENT   TO A FAULT

<P>
   MIAMI _ She who hesitates is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The mindboggling ruling by the 11th Circuit Court Wednesday did
more than temporarily block anyone from taking Elian Gonzalez out
of the country. The ruling renders the government's threats to
remove him from the home of his Miami relatives by force far more
difficult to implement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the three-judge panel came as a surprise even to
advocates of Elian's continued presence in Miami. But far more
surprising was the vehemence with which the court declared that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service had not taken the six
year-old's wishes to stay in the country properly into account. The
government's presumption that a 6-year-old can only be spoken for
by his parent was called into question, as was the Justice
Department's entire strategy in this case.
</P>
<P>
   As is sometimes the case, the judges appear to have been guided
by anything but common sense. The relatives in Miami openly defied
an order to turn over Elian last week. His great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, has declared publicly that he has no intention of
complying with any order to reunite Elian with his father. The
repeated declarations of their legal team that the family will
``obey the law'' have become a mockery. After all that, they win on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Attorney General Janet Reno has no one to blame but
herself. Through deadine upon deadline, threat upon threat, she sat
on her hands. How likely is she to send in US marshals today, after
losing in court? Legally, she held all the cards, but couldn't pull
the trigger. Basically, the protesters stared her down.
</P>
<P>
   Had Reno acted any of the times she threatened to, she wouldn't
appear as she does now _ the chief law enforcement officer
unwilling or unable to enforce the law. Reno has said that she
would prefer not to act in an authoritarian manner, which is
commendable, but she has erred badly in not acting at all.
Meanwhile, Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
pounds her daily for refusing to keep her pledge to reunite father
and son. Some top cop.
</P>
<P>
   Reno put the best spin she could on the ruling Wednesday. She
noted that there was nothing in the ruling that prevents the
Justice Department from taking custody of Elian and delivering him
to Juan Miguel. She didn't say anything about moving to do so,
though _ sparing the world yet another deadline or ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilation filled the streets of Little Havana after the ruling.
A crowd of perhaps 300 (a number easily equaled by the media
throng) cheered wildly. Horns blared. Drivers waved the Cuban flag
from their windows. A group of female Elian supporters, Mothers
Against Oppression, formed a circle in front of the house and
prayed and sang. Even if it proves a minor victory, a temporary
triumph, they saw every reason to savor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a great victory for the rights of this child
and this community,'' said activist Sylvia Iriondo. ``This says
that this is not just a crazy community. Essentially the court has
ruled that this appeal has merit. The best American values have
been suppported today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez of the Democracy Movement, a grassroots
anti-Castro group, had predicted eventual defeat just moments
before the court granted its reprieve. More guarded in his
jubilance than other protesters, he still appeared to expect to
lose in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had hope,'' Sanchez said. ``But of course there are
a lot of forces that don't understand what we're fighting
against.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't Reno's fault that a court issued a silly ruling; they
do that all the time. But her dithering has allowed a bad situation
to steadily worsen. The government will likely prevail in the end,
but for Miami the effects of the Elain affair will linger for a
long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is renowned for keeping her own counsel, and maybe she
really does have a plan. Maybe we will all awake some morning soon
to discover that the rule of law has been restored. But right now,
the might and majesty of the US government don't seem to add up to
much around here. Elian's legal team has successfully stalled and
stalled, and there seems to be no end to Janet Reno's patience.

LONDON'S TINY, BUT MIGHTY, ALMEIDA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic for The Times of
London.  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As a theater reporter for The Times of London wryly
wrote the other day, ``The Almeida's bid for world domination
progresses apace''; and that seems no great exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the tiny but hungry playhouse is reaching out from
mission control in North London to colonize a bit of East London, a
bit of Central London, eventually a bit of New York, and, if NASA
ever opens up the planetary system to space thespians, one day no
doubt bits of the Moon or Mars or both.
</P>
<P>
   If we discount the much-hyped London debut of Kathleen Turner in
a stage version of ``The Graduate'' _ of which more in a moment _
the Almeida has been gobbling up the London critics' attention in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the premiere of Harold Pinter's ``Celebration''
at the company's grungy headquarters in Islington. Then it
presented Nicholas Wright's new ``Cressida'' in the West End, with
a magnificently dilapidated Sir Michael Gambon as a trainer of the
boy actors who took female roles in early-17th-century England. And
now it has reopened the doors of the East End film studios once
used by Alfred Hitchcock and staged ``Richard II'' with Ralph
Fiennes as the king, a production expected at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, along with ``Coriolanus,'' in early September.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Almeida has a habit of dispatching major performers across
the Atlantic. Fiennes as Hamlet, Diana Rigg as Euripides' Medea,
Liam Neeson in David Hare's ``Judas Kiss,'' Kevin Spacey in
O'Neill's ``Iceman Cometh'': all have appeared in the company's
productions in New York, the first two of them picking up Tony
Awards for their pains.
</P>
<P>
   But most artistic exporter-importers would not regard ``Richard
II'' as an especially valuable addition to that inventory.
Shakespeare's inept English king is not, after all, as massive a
creative challenge as his emotionally turbulent Danish prince. The
surprise at the Gainsborough Studios, then, is that Fiennes finds
almost more in a lesser role.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a double surprise, since there is something about
that elegant profile that makes you half-expect a reprise of the
graceful, willowy, vocally exquisite Richard with which John
Gielgud established his importance in London 70 years ago. But
barely has Fiennes been ferried onstage in his glistening white
robe and glistening white throne than he's suggesting why almost
all the English nobles will be delighted to see him lose his crown
to the usurping Bolingbroke.
</P>
<P>
   He uses his thin smile either to mock them or to seek
reassurance from his flatterers, and his tongue to flaunt his wit
or, at one bizarre point, to stick out and wiggle at his angry
uncle, John of Gaunt. He is disdainful, petulant, malicious and
smug.
</P>
<P>
   But there are political as well as personal reasons for
dethroning him. Fiennes' king is clearly improvising public policy
as the whim takes him, whether that means taking charge of Irish
wars, banishing dangerously influential men, raising taxes,
anything. He seizes the exiled Bolingbroke's lands while picking
the petals off a flower, and just as casually.
</P>
<P>
   Never have I seen a Richard II who made me so aware of how quick
and quixotic his key decisions are, and I have seldom seen a
production that so lucidly posed a question still alive when
Shakespeare wrote: is there a point when mortals are entitled to
depose God's deputy on earth, the divinely anointed king?
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kent, who directs, brings energy and pace to a play
that can seem a classroom slog, getting good supporting
performances from Linus Roache, a Bolingbroke with the resolution
and the sureness of political touch that Fiennes' Richard lacks,
and Oliver Ford Davies as a Duke of York less torn than dismembered
by his conflicting loyalties. But in ``Richard II'' it's the title
character who matters, and, despite his unsentimental
interpretation and coldly chiseled profile, you couldn't call
Fiennes inhuman or finally unsympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he displays a self-infatuated glee when he steals
Bolingbroke's birthright, and, yes, he thrusts his head forward
like a venomous cobra when he rejects a man he pretends to love.
But adversity brings out more than just self-pitying bluster and
manic mood swings. There is unexpected majesty in Fiennes' outrage
when, high on a balcony, he confronts the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   There is a moving realism in his recognition that ``I live with
bread like you, feel want, taste grief, need friends.'' And there
is a mournful wisdom when, alone in his prison cell, he confesses
that ``I wasted time and now doth time waste me.'' Even arrogant,
unself-knowing despots can grow _ and Fiennes' Richard proves it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cressida'' at the Albery is set in the 1630s, 40 years after
``Richard II'' was first staged and 20 after Wright's real-life
protagonist joined Shakespeare's company, the King's Men, and
became what contemporary records describe as one of its ``principal
actors.'' And John Shank, as he was called, isn't the only
historical character in the play.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone on the cast list existed: a slick operator
called Blagrave, who simultaneously owned one theater and licensed
plays in rival houses; John Honyman, who was one of Shank's most
successful apprentices; an actor called Richard Robinson, who
married the widow of Richard Burbage, the tragedian who first
played Hamlet and Lear. There was also a boy called Stephen
Hammerton, who was described by one witness as ``a most noted and
beautiful woman actor who afterwards acted, with equal grace and
applause, a young lover's part.''
</P>
<P>
   With much of Nicholas Hytner's production occurring in and
around Shakespeare's Globe, the play's milieu will fascinate any
theater buff. The thespians exchange nostalgic anecdotes and bitchy
complaints in the same colloquial style their successors might
adopt now, but they also evoke a seedy, perilous London, where boys
may be kidnapped, traded, starved or used for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Yet plays need effective plots as well as fascinating settings,
and that is where ``Cressida'' falters. Where is the tension
promised by the opening scene, in which Sir Michael's Shank
descends from the flies on a cloud, explaining he has had a
killer-stroke and denouncing Stephen Hammerton as a traitor? There
is also insufficient point, purpose and narrative clarity in the
long flashback that follows.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Michael Legge's earnestly effeminate Stephen
helps save Shank, who has unwisely invested in a rival company,
from financial disaster and debtor's prison. Therefore the
explanation for his dying master's incoherent rage is to be found
elsewhere, presumably in the triumph that the boy enjoyed when he
played the female lead in Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'' in
a more womanly style than his master thinks proper.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But how can we be sure, when we never see Stephen in
performance? Still, there are compensations for the play's
uncertainties and occasional longueurs, and most of them are called
Gambon. Think of a Jacobean minotaur, big and bovine but mentally
as well as physically agile, who can roar yet wheedle, sneer yet
bring a fierce intensity to his calling _ and you have a
wonderfully commanding, varied performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebration,'' the most recent of the few plays Harold Pinter
has written in the last two decades, comes in a double bill with
his very first, which he wrote in 1957. It is a happy conjunction,
for ``The Room'' sheds a misty, Pinteresque light on almost
everything the dramatist has produced in the last 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Duncan's pinched, nervous Rose babbles out banalities to
her grimly impassive husband and to the strangers who intrude on
her small, shabby flat, obscurely threatening both it and her. As
often with Pinter, there is a sense of unease and embattled dread
in ``The Room,'' a sense that nameless horrors may slip like
mustard gas through the cracks into private spaces.
</P>
<P>
   There is poison in the air of ``Celebration,'' too, though its
smell rises more strongly from the text than from Pinter's own
production, which is often and unexpectedly hilarious. At one of
two tables in a chic London restaurant, two mobsterlike brothers
are noisily enjoying themselves with their spouses, themselves two
slatternly sisters. At the other, a genteel husband is apologizing
to his wife for an amour with his secretary, only to be tauntingly
informed by her that she, too, has had plenty of affairs, including
one with the most obnoxious and foul-mouthed of the diners a few
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again Pinter contrasts the surface bonhomie _ ``What a
wonderful restaurant this is!'' _ with the ugly drives below. There
is insecurity, anger, sexual envy, contempt and even hatred behind
the strenuous smiles and the brash bravado.
</P>
<P>
   You get a pretty clear idea of the emotional truth when Keith
Allen, playing the louder brother, boozily declares that he knows
that his friends and family love him, trust him, and wouldn't like
``to see me hung, drawn and quartered,'' or when Steven Pacey as
the unfaithful husband declares that he feels a wonderful sense of
harmony and for once doesn't want to ``kill everyone in sight.'' It
doesn't take a phrase book to Pinterland to decode the menace
behind the rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with ``One for the Road'' in 1983, Pinter has produced
several terse, tough plays that deal openly with torture, political
wrongdoing and the abuse of human rights. ``Celebration'' is,
perhaps, a surreptitious addition to the same files. The coarse,
crude brothers turn out to be ``strategy consultants'' dedicated to
``keeping the peace worldwide.'' The well-bred adulterer is a
banker, keen to do a deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Only one character, an eccentric waiter who bores customers with
tall tales of a grandfather who met everyone from T.S. Eliot to
Winston Churchill, reminds us that there are or were alternatives
to the society Pinter damns with such sly panache: the consumerist,
philistine, sinister and brutal Britain of A.D. 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone who saw them forget Dustin Hoffman's solemn
young Benjamin Braddock and Anne Bancroft's infinitely cool
performance as the middle-aged mistress he never calls anything
more intimate than Robinson?
</P>
<P>
   Those with fond or even unfond memories of ``The Graduate'' will
wonder why Terry Johnson has transposed the 1967 film of Charles
Webb's novel to the stage, and may not feel that the production at
the Gielgud, also directed by Johnson, provides a sufficient
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the story of Ben's seduction and his growing attachment
to Robinson's daughter Elaine skims along amusingly enough, thanks
to banks of louvered wooden walls inside of which a bedroom, a
nightclub, even a church can be economically suggested. There are
strange miscalculations, though. Anne Bancroft would never have
lolled on the floor with Katharine Ross' Elaine, like two sorority
girls, and had a boozy rap session about Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sudden sight of the elegant Bancroft face, twisted
and aged by the discovery that her daughter knows her secret, gave
the movie one of its great, wordless moments. Nor would film buffs
have been impressed by an ending in which Robinson offers Elaine
shrugging permission to elope with Ben in the middle of her wedding
to a boring admirer.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the play follows Webb's novel in stressing that
very 1960s subject, the need to resist overwhelming parents and
oppressive suburbia. That is why Matthew Rhys' Ben is far more the
restless, insecure post-adolescent than Hoffman's prototype, whose
rebellion largely consisted of glum silences.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner, too, exudes svelte contempt for her
surroundings, giving a performance that lacks Bancroft's
vulnerability but is packed with comic assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The British newspapers, I fear, have devoted much space to
salacious descriptions of a moment in which she briefly displays

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day before Coca-Cola's annual meeting with shareholders,
which is expected to include protests by black Coca-Cola employees,
the company said Wednesday that it lost $58 million in the first
quarter, much of that because of one-time charges for
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   That translated into a loss of 2 cents a diluted share, compared
with net income of $747 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period
a year earlier. Revenue fell to $4.39 billion from $4.40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding all the charges, the company said, it would have
earned 32 cents a share. But the company took an 8-cent charge for
the costs of laying off thousands of employees worldwide and a
10-cent charge for reducing concentrate inventories at several
bottlers. Both charges were announced as part of a reorganization
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also said it would reduce earnings by 16 cents a share
to cover the costs of writing down its bottling plants in India.
That write-down, which sent earnings into negative territory, was
announced at a meeting with analysts and money managers in New York
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Volume rose just 2 percent in the quarter worldwide excluding
Schweppes brands acquired last year, the company said, which
matched analysts' expectations. Including those brands, volume rose
3.5 percent over all. Volume in the United States, the biggest
soft-drink market, was slightly weaker than expected, showing no
growth except when the company's Minute Maid division, which makes
juice and juice drinks, was added in.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, Coke is putting Minute Maid into its
volume numbers for North America, adding a point of growth,'' said
Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, has said that
increasing noncarbonated beverages is a central part of the
company's growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster volume in the first quarter increases the need
for Coke to show strong growth for the rest of the year, several
analysts said. ``There is a fingers-crossed mentality that their
marketing plan will be able to deliver stronger levels of volume
growth around the world,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They are going to have to step up
their marketing for the second and third quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the marketing programs in place might not generate high
volume because prices are also rising in some areas, he added.
``You may have to spend more to convince the consumer in
supermarkets and other future-consumption channels to buy the same
amount of cola, given the higher pricing,'' he said, noting that
cola sales for both Coke and its main rival, Pepsico, have been
trailing off in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In its earnings report, Coke offered more detail about where it
was selling less concentrate, the result of stockpiled inventory
around the world. In Asia, concentrate sales fell 16 percent,
``primarily in Japan,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst noted that Japan was the highest-priced market for
Coke concentrate, and any reduction in sales to Japanese bottlers
has a significant effect on the company. ``As Japan goes, so goes
Coca-Cola,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a beverage analyst for ING
Barings in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter was the eighth consecutive one in which Coke's
earnings declined. The company is under pressure from Wall Street
to improve its performance, and the stock has fallen 19 percent
since Daft was named to the top job in December. Shares of
Coca-Cola fell 81.25 cents Wednesday, to $47.6875.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Coke is also in talks to resolve a
racial-discrimination lawsuit filed last year by four of its black
employees. The number of plaintiffs has since grown to eight, and
lawyers are seeking class-action status for the case, which could
affect as many as 2,000 current and former workers at Coke. The
plaintiffs say they were denied promotions, raises and other
benefits because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   A group of current and former black employees plans to attend
the shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del., Thursday to draw
investors' attention to their situation.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's largest bottler, also reported
earnings yesterday that reflected weaker volume. Its loss narrowed
to $34 million, or 8 cents a share, from $61 million, or 15 cents a
share, in the period a year earlier. But the bottler reported
higher revenue, $3.29 billion compared with $3.27 billion in the
quarter a year earlier.

JUSTICES TACKLE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF `MIRANDA WARNING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with
whether an obscure federal law blunts the justices' 34-year-old
admonition that police warn those they arrest of their right to
remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   The court, hearing a case from Virginia, considered the
continued vitality of the court's well-known ``Miranda warning,''
which has become a staple of law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, which arose from the court's 1966 decision in
Miranda vs. Arizona, calls for police to tell those they arrest of
their constitutional right to remain silent and that anything they
say can and will be used against them in court.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issue before the justices Wednesday was whether the
Constitution requires police to warn suspects or if Congress can
enact a law, as it did in 1968, allowing officers to forgo the
warning and accept confessions so long as they are given
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to render its decision by July.
</P>
<P>
   The justices seemed split on the issue as they considered
whether a suspected bank robber's incriminating statements should
be allowed at trial even though he was not warned of his rights.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter, for example,
said the Miranda warning is constitutionally required because it
ensures that suspects are fully apprised of their Fifth Amendment
privilege against self incrimination before they choose to confess.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing his colleagues, Justice Stephen G. Breyer hailed the
Miranda warning as ``a hallmark of American justice.'' He added
that ``at least 2 billion people around the world know'' of a
criminal suspect's right to remain silent in the United States
because of the fame the warning has garnered through television
shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia said the Constitution requires no
such police warning and allows confessions to be admitted in court
so long as they were given voluntarily, without any coercion from
officers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case before the justices, the U.S. District Court for
Eastern Virginia refused to admit into evidence suspected bank
robber Charles Dickerson's statement to police that he had driven
the getaway car and stored a gun at his apartment after the January
1997 theft of $876. The court said police had failed to warn
Dickerson of his right to remain silent before he spoke and was
charged with bank robbery, conspiracy and using a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision
in February 1999, saying the statements could be used at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, citing the federal law, said Dickerson knew his
rights and made his statements to the police voluntarily. In
addition, the court said the Miranda warning is not required under
the Constitution but is a guideline police could adopt to ensure
valid confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the justices, Dickerson's attorney, James
Hundley, urged the court to rule that the incriminating statements
should not be admitted at trial because officers had violated the
Constitution by not warning Dickerson of his right to silence.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley of Fairfax, Va., said the Miranda warning serves to
``fully inform'' suspects of their constitutional right and ensures
that those who opt to confess do so in a ``knowing and
intelligent'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman echoed Hundley in pressing
the Clinton administration's support for the position that Miranda
warnings are constitutionally required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability in the law is important,'' Waxman said, adding that
police for the past 34 years have regarded Miranda as a
constitutional mandate.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalia said that the Miranda warning is a ``procedural''
rule that helps guide police in questioning suspects but is not
constitutionally mandated. Congress can enact a law, as it did,
that gives police greater leeway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for the prosecution, attorney Paul Cassell told the
justices that they have often permitted confessions to be admitted
at trial even when police had not warned defendants of their
rights. These confessions could not have been admitted had the
Miranda warnings been constitutionally required, said Cassell, of
Salt Lake City.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Miranda's moment of truth, a richly symbolic test
of whether this landmark of the Warren Court will survive the much
more conservative era of the Rehnquist Court, arrived Wednesday
morning in a crowded Supreme Court with the justices armed for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   For the justices who favor upholding the 34-year-old precedent,
which requires police to inform suspects of their rights to remain
silent and to consult a lawyer, the weapon of choice was Miranda
vs. Arizona itself. They read aloud excerpts that appeared to
anchor the decision directly in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   For the justices who over the years have expressed doubt about
the decision's wisdom or continued viability, the weapons were a
series of subsequent rulings that limited Miranda, suggesting that
its famous warnings were merely ``prophylactic'' rather than
constitutionally required and allowing prosecutors to use
confessions obtained in violation of Miranda for purposes other
than direct evidence against a defendant. A decision is expected by
late June.
</P>
<P>
   As theater, the argument was first-rate. As a predictor of the
outcome of this case, which asks the court to weigh Miranda against
a long-ignored 1968 federal law by which Congress sought to
overrule it, the session was less satisfying. Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, who are widely perceived as in
positions to cast the swing votes, were obviously deeply interested
in the case but did not tip their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, nothing that happened in the courtroom provided an
answer to the question of whether even those justices who, like
O'Connor, have been critical of Miranda were actually prepared to
bury a ``hallmark of American justice,'' as Justice Stephen G.
Breyer, clearly a Miranda supporter, described the precedent on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman, arguing for the Clinton
administration in support of Miranda, tailored his argument to the
court's inherent institutional preference for standing by its
precedents. ``Stability in the law is important, and it is nowhere
more important than in this case,'' Waxman said. He said that by
giving police and courts clear rules for handling confessions,
Miranda ``has proven workable, and its benefits to the
administration of justice have been repeatedly emphasized by this
court and documented by this court.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman urged the justices to recall the court's ``extremely
unhappy'' experience, during the 30 years that preceded Miranda, of
trying to find a way to test, on a case-by-case basis, whether a
confession was truly voluntary. In three dozen prior cases, he
said, ``the court was simply unable to articulate manageable rules
for the lower courts to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   While retaining ``voluntariness'' as the ultimate test of
whether a confession could be admissible in court, the Supreme
Court in Miranda vs. Arizona announced that a confession by a
suspect in custody would be presumed involuntary unless the suspect
had been informed of his right to remain silent and given ``a
continuous opportunity'' to exercise that right.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, two years later, in Section 3501 of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, an anti-Miranda
majority in Congress provided that the warnings were not necessary
and that federal trial judges instead should ``take into
consideration all the circumstances'' in deciding whether a
confession was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond
startled the Justice Department and much of the legal world by
ruling that Section 3501 had effectively overruled Miranda for
federal prosecutions. Ruling in the case of an indicted bank
robber, the 4th Circuit applied Section 3501 and found that
incriminating statements by Charles Thomas Dickerson were
admissible. The U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., had
suppressed the statements on the ground that the police had not
given Dickerson the Miranda warnings before questioning him.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, while still intending the Justice
Department to prosecute Dickerson on bank robbery charges, agreed
with the defendant that Miranda, and not Section 3501, was the
proper test to apply. The administration therefore joined in the
Supreme Court appeal, Dickerson vs. United States, No. 99-5525,
leaving no one to argue before the court in support of the 4th
Circuit's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Such a circumstance is rare but not unknown to the justices, who
when they agreed to hear the appeal appointed a former Supreme
Court law clerk, Paul G. Cassell, a law professor at the University
of Utah, to argue in support of Section 3501. Cassell is perhaps
the best known academic critic of Miranda and, on behalf of the
Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal organization
here, had presented the winning argument to the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The central question for the Supreme Court in this case is the
constitutional status of Miranda vs. Arizona. Indisputably, the
court intended in Miranda to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right
against compelled self-incrimination. The question is whether, as a
strategy to accomplish that goal, the essence of the decision is
itself constitutionally compelled, in which case Congress cannot
overturn it simply by passing a law, or whether the court was
adopting one permissible alternative among several.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subtle distinction,'' James W. Hundley, Dickerson's
lawyer, told the justices Wednesday. While the precise language of
the warnings is not itself constitutionally compelled, he said,
``the constitutional requirement of Miranda is that there be
protective procedures in place to fully inform a suspect of his
rights, so that he knows his rights, so that he knows he can
exercise those rights, he knows that his interrogators will honor
those rights, and so that the court will know that any waiver of
those rights was made knowingly and intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Section 3501 was deficient, he said, because it ``simply reverts
the analysis back to the totality-of-circumstances test'' the court
had found ``unworkable and inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, however, described Miranda as no more than a
``provisional, interim judgment about how to go about enforcing
Fifth Amendment rights.'' He paraphrased the court's holding in
Miranda as: ``In the absence of appropriate congressional or
legislative action, the following procedures are prerequisites to
the admissibility of confessions.'' Then Cassell added, ``Ah, but
of course we now have appropriate congressional action.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Section 3501 was in fact, and was intended by Congress
to be, an adequate substitute for Miranda, and he suggested at one
point that it offered more expansive protections for criminal
suspects. Justice John Paul Stevens, a Miranda defender, cut him
off. ``You make a wonderful argument on a lot of points,'' Stevens
said, ``but I think it's going to be tough to convince me that 3501
was intended to expand the protection granted by Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much attention paid Wednesday to Chief Justice Earl
Warren's statement at the end of his Miranda opinion that ``the
Constitution does not require any specific code of procedures for
protecting the privilege against self-incrimination during
custodial interrogation.'' The court went on to say there that
``Congress and the states are free to develop their own safeguards
for the privilege'' _ a phrase often used in debates about Miranda
to support the position that the warnings are not constitutionally
required.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, another Miranda supporter,
quoted to Cassell the second half of that phrase: ``so long as they
are fully as effective as those described above in informing
accused persons of their right of silence and in affording a
continuous opportunity to exercise it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've certainly accurately quoted the opinion, Justice
Ginsburg,'' Cassell replied.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that the sentence was ``not at all necessary'' to the
court's decision in Miranda but that in any event, Section 3501 met
the court's test. The law gave ``clear incentives'' to police to
continue administering the equivalent of Miranda warnings as a way
of ensuring that a confession would be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ```Incentive' is not `required,''' Justice David H. Souter,
another clear Miranda supporter on the court, said to Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a difference,'' the lawyer replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet,'' Souter said.

BRISTOL-MYERS DELAYS FDA REVIEW OF BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb withdrew its application for government
approval of a promising blood pressure medication Wednesday after
regulators asked for more information on the severe swelling the
drug caused in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, called Vanlev, had been expected to quickly become a
blockbuster, with annual sales of more than $1 billion a year.
Studies have shown the drug could be one of the most potent heart
medications on the market. And, in January, regulators at the Food
and Drug Administration put the drug on a fast track for approval,
saying they thought it was a significant advance over similar
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Wednesday that it planned to continue clinical
trials with the drug and expected to resubmit its application for
approval early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain bullish on this drug,'' said Richard J. Lane,
president of the company's worldwide medicines group.
</P>
<P>
   But with Wednesday's decision, initial sales of Vanlev will be
delayed by at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The move is another blow to Bristol-Myers, which is in danger of
soon losing its exclusive patent on Taxol, its top-selling cancer
drug, after losing a recent court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bristol-Myers plummeted after the announcement,
falling $14.625, or 22 percent, to $50.625.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said that FDA regulators were concerned about
patients in clinical trials who developed a rare side effect called
angioedema, which is swelling in the face, throat, lips or tongue.
In a conference call Wednesday afternoon, company officials said
that 44 out of of 7,000 patients in clinical trials had developed
angioedema, but only four of those cases were severe. In those
cases, the patients needed to have a tube inserted down their
throats to breathe. All four survived, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev was expected to be the first drug approved in a new class
of blood pressure drugs known as vasopeptidase inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, known chemically as omapatrilat, has been shown in
studies to be more effective than drugs currently on the market in
lowering systolic blood pressure, the first and larger of the two
numbers obtained when blood pressure is measured. Systolic is the
pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts, while diastolic
is the pressure when the heart is relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Ideal blood pressure is less than 140 over 90.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also hope that Vanlev could help black patients, who do
not respond as well as white patients to blood pressure drugs now
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that I won't have the drug to use this
year,'' said Dr. Henry R. Black, chairman of preventive medicine at
Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. ``But if
there are safety concerns, they need to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay of Vanlev is a boost for the company's competitor,
Pfizer. Pfizer makes Norvasc, which is now the top-selling
hypertension drug. Norvasc had sales last year of more than $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bristol-Myers cited studies that found that Vanlev
was more powerful than Norvasc and Zestril, another blood pressure
drug sold by AstraZeneca.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers was counting on sales of Vanlev to replace revenue
it may lose from some of its other top drugs that will soon lose
their patent protection. The company is trying to block a group of
drug companies from marketing a generic form Taxol. Last month,
Ivax Corp. said it expected to win government approval of its
version of Taxol within months. Bristol-Myers sold $1.5 billion
worth of the drug last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers will also soon lose its patent protection on
glucophage, a top-selling diabetes drug that added $1.3 billion to
its revenue last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Leah Gyarmati received the bad news moments after the race. She
could live with finishing second _ she is, after all, 10 for 10 in
the money since becoming a trainer _ but having her horse claimed
was enough to rock her backward.
</P>
<P>
   Gyarmati muttered an inelegant word she certainly never heard
when she was earning her master's degree in theology at Samford
University, but might have acquired in her two years as a jockey.
Then she commiserated with her jockey, Diane Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Women are still a distinct minority at the racetrack, but
Gyarmati and Nelson have had a good bit of success since linking up
with the modest partnership called Castle Village Farm. Wednesday
they paid the price in heartache. Adverse went off the favorite,
and before the gates opened, another trainer, Pat Reynolds, had
claimed him for $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is out _ Leah nurtures a horse,'' said Dr. Larry
Marcus, a surgeon from Hartford, Conn., one of about 40 investors
who have kicked in an average of $1,000 to form Castle Village
Farm, which has no white fences, no barns, no precious acreage in
horse country, just four stalls at Belmont and a new trainer who
happens to be a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gyarmati loves her four horses but loved Adverse most of all
because she had been an exercise rider back when he was a fractious
youth in Jimmy Jerkens' stable. The horse nearly bit off the finger
of the managing partner, Steve Zorn, and Gyarmati placed a large
red cone in front of Adverse's stall at Belmont to warn people
away, with the pride of a parent who knows her offspring is
difficult but just may grow up to be somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd get loose at Saratoga once a week and snap at people,''
Gyarmati said fondly.
</P>
<P>
   She had trained Adverse only since March 11, when she convinced
her investors that he was worth $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to use the income to strengthen our stable,'' said
Alice Olson, a partner and also director of continuing education at
Sarah Lawrence College. ``If the partnership makes money, we get
paid just enough to settle the taxes. We're happy to pay taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules of the partnership are that the investors want
to have fun, that they will work through the managing partner, that
women have a place in racing, and that everybody listens to the
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Gyarmati had followed Adverse as he was claimed twice and gelded
once. She knew she was taking a chance entering him in a claiming
race because he has traces of Seattle Slew in him, was bred at
George Steinbrenner's Kinsman Farms, and has raced for stakes
higher than the claiming price of $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   She hoped, however, that the horse's reputation for temper would
scare claimers off, but word of her hot hand was getting around,
including several places in Wednesday's Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   Gyarmati grew up riding show horses, worked nine years for Allen
Jerkens and Mike Hushion, then earned two degrees and was starting
her doctorate in theology at Drew University when she decided to
try riding. After two years and 15 trips to the winner's circle,
Gyarmati was ready for law school, but Steve and Jean Zorn, both
law professors, asked her to train for the new partnership.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered Flippy Diane and No Bad Habits for the group and
Storm Magest for a subgroup called the Snowbirds, and recently
added four other horses. She still exercises her own horses, and
thinks women have a particular touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman may try to find out why,'' Gyarmati said. ``A man
might say, `You're going, whether you like it or not.' There, I
said it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those same reasons, she said, she uses Diane Nelson on her
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's as good as anybody you can get,'' Gyarmati said.
``She's a thinker. I can sit and talk with her. She'll tell me more
than I want to know. She'll take a horse for a walk, trying to
figure out what's best. She also follows instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in the paddock, Gyarmati glanced at Wolf Boy, the No.
6 horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode him 15 times,'' Gyarmati said softly, with obvious
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty investors gathered in the mostly empty owners' box at
Aqueduct, whose official attendance was exactly 3,488. (All the
action these weeks is in Kentucky, where a female trainer, Jeanine
Sahadi, will saddle a Derby favorite, The Deputy.) The Castle
Village Farm folks outcheered a first-place finisher a few weeks
ago, quite unusual behavior at the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be losing money, but now I'm a bit of a shtarker, you
know, a Jewish word for a big shot,'' said Dick Zausner, the owner
of the Port Washington Tennis Academy, who has no experience in
racing but joined a few partnerships for fun. ``I park in the
owners' lot, I get a pass to the paddock.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Adverse took the early lead in the slop while his
owners chanted the familiar track litany: Stay in front! Come on,
Diane! Cut the corner! Uh-oh! Stay away from the rail! Uh-oh! Hang
on, Diane! Lost by a nostril! Wolf Boy, on the outside, had won by
a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always in the money,'' one partner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly happy,'' Alice Olson said. ``They're safe.''
</P>
<P>
   They were safe, but then Sal Sciarra, the clerk of scales, broke
the news that Reynolds had claimed the horse. The partnership had
won $6,500 for finishing second, and had now made a profit of
$40,000 on the claim, but they were out one very impetuous horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' said Nelson, who had lost one of her mounts. ``You
have to enter races like this. But you get attached to a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, Gyarmati approximated a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult,'' she said. ``But you know what? In a race
or two, he'll be back in the claimers again, and I'll have to
persuade my owners to claim him again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's yours if you want him,'' Alice Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes, as soon as Adverse passed his drug test,
Gyarmati would officially hand him over to the new owners. Then she
would pick up her daughter at school. There was no need to go back
to the barn this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had eight horses,'' Gyarmati said. ``Now I have seven.'' Her
record for 10 races is four firsts, four seconds and two thirds,
for earnings of $178,250. The odds are getting shorter on Castle
Village Farm and Leah Gyarmati.

RALLY FIZZLES AS STOCKS DROP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Disappointment with first-quarter reports from IBM
and Intel helped send stocks lower Wednesday, ending the two-day
surge that followed last week's drastic sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline should not have been a surprise. After a two-day
rally that saw the Nasdaq composite index jump 14.2 percent and the
Dow Jones industrial average rise 4.5 percent, a pause was likely.
During the rallies on Monday and Tuesday, even bullish analysts
were cautioning that the market did not move up in a straight line.
Many of the other stocks that fell Wednesday, including Cisco,
Oracle and Microsoft, had rallied Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People needed to catch their breath,'' said Thomas M. Galvin,
chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 87.16 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,706.41, while
the Dow industrials dropped 92.46 points, or 0.9 percent, to
10,674.96. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was off 14.1
points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,427.47. All three indexes were up
for the day until around noon.
</P>
<P>
   The once high-flying dot-com stocks that have fallen so sharply
recently were down again Wednesday more than the broader market.
The Street.com index of these stocks dropped 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. also played a big role in
Wednesday's decline. After it announced that for reasons of safety
it was delaying its request for government approval of its Vanlev
blood pressure drug, the stock plunged 14|, or 22.4 percent, to
50|. It was the second biggest drag, after Intel, on the S.&AMP; P.
500.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's stock market decline shows how important
first-quarter earnings reports will be to the outlook for the near
term. At the end of last week, after the Nasdaq had fallen 25.3
percent and the Dow 7.3 percent, strategists cautioned investors
not to panic, in part because they expected strong first-quarter
earnings, especially in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   But with the mood as fragile as it is, investors may decide to
focus more on whatever bad news they may find in an otherwise good
profit report. Or good earnings just may not be good enough.
Caterpillar reported first-quarter earnings Tuesday of 73 cents a
share, well above analysts' forecast of 58 cents a share.
Wednesday, shares of Caterpillar dropped 2{, to 37|.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Salamone, research director at Schaeffer's Investment
Research in Cincinnati, said, ``We take as a negative sign over the
short-term'' the decline after the IBM and Intel earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, IBM reported that it had beaten profit estimates.
But it also said that its revenue had fallen 5 percent in the first
quarter. And that is what disturbed investors. In after-hours
trading Tuesday, IBM shares dropped 3], to 111{. They fell 10}, or
9.3 percent, Wednesday to 104].
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which also reported its earnings after the market closed
Tuesday, said both profits and revenue rose. But the company said
that revenue growth in the current quarter would just match the
first quarter. Wednesday, shares of Intel dropped 9 15/16, or 7.7
percent, to 119 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a momentum driven market,'' Galvin said,
referring to the fact that many investors have been buying the
stocks just because they think they are hot, without regard to
company performance and profits. ``Revenue is the better indicator
of momentum,'' Galvin added, ``and a revenue slowdown won't be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally on Monday and Tuesday, even with Wednesday's setback,
has probably made a lot of investors feel better, especially those
with concentrations of technology stocks. One way to measure how
much better they may feel is to tabulate the overall performance of
stocks compared with last Friday, when both the Dow and the Nasdaq
had their biggest one-day point losses in history.

APPLE REPORTS BIG PROFITS AND 2-FOR-1 SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer reported earnings Wednesday that
handily beat analysts' estimates for its second fiscal quarter. In
contrast to the slowing sales for many PC makers, Apple reported
strong demand across its product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting a one-time gain from a stock sale, Apple reported
earnings per share of 88 cents. Analysts had expected 81 cents,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Apple also beat the
so-called whisper number of 87 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company capped the earnings report by announcing a 2-for-1
stock split, to take effect on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Apple reported its results after the market closed. Amid a broad
decline on the Nasdaq, its shares closed at $121.125, down $5.75.
But in after-hours trading, the stock moved as high as $125.5625.
</P>
<P>
   After years of suffering for being outside the ``Wintel'' PC
standard set by Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's
microprocessors, Apple is benefiting from its proprietary hardware
and operating system software, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While several mainstream PC manufacturers reported a slowdown in
the first quarter as corporate customers waited for the release of
Windows 2000, which is geared toward business networks, Apple sales
surged and continued to outpace the growth of the industry as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 1, Apple reported earnings of $233
million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared with $135 million, or
84 cents per share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenue
for the quarter was $1.94 billion, up 27 percent from $1.53 billion
in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter's results included a $73 million after-tax gain from
the sale of 1.5 million shares of ARM Holdings PLC, which
contributed 40 cents to earnings per diluted share. Without
nonrecurring items, Apple earned $160 million, an increase of 72
percent from the year-ago quarter. Apple still owns 9.4 million
shares in ARM.
</P>
<P>
   Apple sold slightly more than a million computers in the
quarter, 26 percent more than the same quarter last year. Of these,
100,000 were Powerbook laptops, and 350,000 were G4 PowerMacs, the
company's high-end line. Sales of these higher-priced models,
together with lower freight costs and lower memory chip prices,
helped spur gross profit margins to 28.2 percent, up from 26.3
percent in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt really good about the numbers,'' Steven P. Jobs,
Apple's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ``We think
there was really good demand for the pro products, and there's
really good demand for the consumer products too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said 28 percent of the consumer-oriented iMacs sold in the
quarter went to first-time computer buyers, and 17 percent to
buyers converting from Windows-based machines. Although Apple did
not provide similar analysis for its pro models, Jobs said there
was some evidence the company was gaining new users, or regaining
old Macintosh users there as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the creative professional market, Apple has always had a
pretty strong market share, and it is possible people are coming
back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said he thought
Apple gained sales from longtime Macintosh users who had waited
until the company's recovery to buy new machines. ``I suspect
there's a deferred upgrade cycle going on, where people who were a
little doubtful are finally convinced that, OK, now I can buy
myself a new Mac,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has formed a partnership with Earthlink to provide
Internet services, and last quarter said that the relationship
would add an incremental $25 million to $30 million to earnings
this year. ``We're trending toward the high end of that,'' Jobs
said. ``We think we're going to be one of the most profitable
Internet companies this year.''

 McCAIN ADMITS HE LACKED CANDOR ON CONFEDERATE FLAG ISSUE  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain apologized Wednesday for not
having called for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from
the South Carolina Statehouse when he campaigned in the state's
Republican presidential primary, saying he had compromised his
principles out of political self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who built his presidential quest on a reputation for
candor and patriotism, said he had equivocated on the flag issue
because he feared that if his true feelings had been known they
would have undermined his effort to wrest the nomination from Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. McCain said in the campaign that the
divisive issues should be left to the state, as had Bush, who stood
by the position Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a subdued speech at a luncheon a stone's throw from the
Capitol where the Confederate battle flag flies, McCain, a former
Navy war hero whose ancestors fought for the South, indicted
himself for a lapse in honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the
South Carolina primary,'' McCain said. ``So I chose to compromise
my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain lost the Feb. 19 primary, a defeat that severely hurt his
chance to derail Bush's drive to the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the pivotal primary campaign, McCain repeatedly was asked his
opinion on whether the flag should be removed from atop the Capitol
dome. Many liberal and civil rights organizations, led by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, have
been pressing to have the flag known as the ``star and bars'' taken
down, declaring that it is a symbol of slavery and oppression of
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCain said that he considered the flag a ``symbol
of racism and slavery.'' The next day he called it a ``symbol of
heritage,'' a phrase used by supporters of the flag. At all times
he declared that the issue should be left up to the people of South
Carolina to decide without interference from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday McCain said that both of his characterizations of
the flag were accurate, and that he still believed the matter
should be handled by state officials. But, McCain went on to say
that his Confederate forefathers ``fought on the wrong side of
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe their service, however distinguished, needs to
be commemorated in a way that offends, that deeply hurts, people
whose ancestors were once denied their freedom by my ancestors,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's statement Wednesday may place pressure on Bush to
clearly state where he stands. But McCain refused to be drawn in to
a discussion of what his action might mean for his one-time rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an issue that affected my campaign,'' he told
reporters after his speech. ``I don't believe it will affect anyone
else's.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's appearance Wednesday before the South Carolina Policy
Council, a conservative, business-oriented research group, was his
first trip back to the state since his defeat in the primary. In
his absence the issue of the flag has continued to simmer. Last
week, the South Carolina Senate passed a compromise measure that
would remove the battle flag from atop the dome and place a smaller
version in a monument to Confederate soldiers on the Capitol
grounds. That measure is now before the South Carolina House of
Representatives. The outcome there is uncertain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In response to questions, McCain also repeated his insistence
that he would ``categorically state to Governor Bush that I do not
want to be asked'' to be the presumptive Republican nominee's
running mate in the fall. The Texas governor has said he wanted to
discuss this directly with McCain at a meeting scheduled for early
May.
</P>
<P>
   As for flying the battle flag, ``Governor Bush believes on
principle that this is a state issue for the people of South
Carolina to decide, and, as he predicted, they are working to
address,'' said Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a prepared text at the luncheon, McCain
acknowledged that his belated confession would not shield him from
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend for this apology to help me evade criticism
for my failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be criticized by all sides for my late act of
contrition,'' McCain added. ``I accept it, all of it. I deserve it.
Honesty is easy after the fact when my own interests are no longer
involved. I don't seek absolution.''
</P>
<P>
   How McCain's comments will affect the debate here is an open
question. After his speech he was given a standing ovation by most
of the about 60 people at the luncheon. Later, several pressed
forward to shake his hand and say they admired his candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took a lot of courage to come back down here and do
this, to admit a mistake and to admit he may be criticized for the
mistake,'' said Cordell Maddox, a Democratic representative from
Anderson, S.C., who supports the Senate measure. ``What I'm hoping
is that it's going to give some courage to people who are on the
fence about the Senate compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who did not join in the acclaim for McCain was Jake
Knotts, a state Republican representative from Lexington County
outside Columbia who sat in stony silence while others applauded.
Knotts was one of the few Republican legislators who supported
McCain in the primary. He is also a flag supporter who said he had
pressed McCain in the campaign on his true feelings about the
Confederate icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm disappointed in him, very disappointed in him,''
Knotts said to reporters after the speech. ``I'm not only
disappointed, I'm ashamed of him. I'm ashamed that he lied to the
people of South Carolina in order to further his political
career.''

ALICE S. MARRIOTT, 92, MATRIARCH OF THE HOTEL-FOUNDING FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Utah)  By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Sheets Marriott, matriarch of the tight-knit family whose
name stands on thousands of hotels worldwide, died on Monday in
Washington. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1927 with a single root beer stand, Marriott and
her husband, J. Willard Marriott Sr., built one of the world's
leading hospitality companies. Today, Marriott International, which
is still run by the Marriott family, has more than 140,000 workers
and annual sales approaching $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Marriott also raised a family that now numbers
two children, eight grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. She
``personified the American dream,'' Marriott International said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Sheets was born in Salt Lake City, on Oct. 19, 1907. In
June 1927, while still a teen-ager, she graduated with honors from
the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Spanish. Two
days later, she married Marriott, another University of Utah
graduate, and the couple set off in a Model T Ford to Washington,
where Marriott had just opened a root beer stand. There she worked
as the shop's bookkeeper, taking its hard-earned nickels to the
bank each day.
</P>
<P>
   As summer turned to fall, root beer sales slipped, leaving the
Marriotts anxious to expand their menu. Marriott spoke to the chef
of the Mexican Embassy to learn the recipes for tamales and chili
con carne. The Marriotts practiced the dishes in their apartment
for two days, then added them to the menu at the stand, which they
renamed The Hot Shoppe. The spicy dishes were a hit, and the
Marriotts quickly opened more Hot Shoppes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost from the start, my parents _ especially my father _
launched the process of figuring out how to do something right and
then writing it down. From washing windows to burnishing silverware
to arranging buffet tables and processing customers' checks, no
aspect of the workplace went untouched,'' J.W. Marriott Jr., wrote
in his 1997 memoir, ``The Spirit to Serve: Marriott's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   A devotion to detail served the Marriotts well, as the chain
thrived, eventually expanding to 65 sites. The Marriott family was
also growing _ J.W. Jr. was born in 1932, and Richard followed in
1939.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1957, the Marriotts moved into the hotel business,
which was taking off in tandem with the interstate highways.
Marriott spent much of the night before the opening of the first
Marriott hotel, the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Arlington, Va.,
helping hang pictures in each of its 365 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   By offering travelers a consistent, dependable and safe night's
rest, the Marriott chain quickly surpassed more established
competitors. Today, many hotel operators consider Marriott the
world's top hotel company, with a reputation for treating employees
and customers fairly.
</P>
<P>
   As Marriott grew, Marriott spent more time on charity work in
the Washington area, including serving two 10-year terms on the
board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. A
conservative Republican, she was vice chairman of the Republican
National Committee from 1965 to 1976, and honorary chairman of the
1973 Nixon inaugural committee. &QL;

$25.5 MILLION IN GRANTS GO TO TEXAS SCIENTISTS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Welch Foundation announced Wednesday it has
awarded $25.5 million to scientists doing basic research in
chemistry at 26 Texas institutions, the foundation's biggest outlay
ever.
</P>

   In the World War II submarine adventure ``U-571,'' everybody
needs a good mechanic. German skipper, American lieutenant
commander, it doesn't matter which side they're on; just give 'em a
guy who knows his way around a diesel, and they can win the war.
</P>
<P>
   The film's own helmer, writer-director Jonathan Mostow
(``Breakdown''), believes in that strategy, too. ``U-571'' is the
most mechanical nail-biter to come down the tube in many months.
It's technically impressive and produces tense, life-and-death
situations with assembly- line efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it seems entirely made by, and often about,
robots.
</P>
<P>
   It's also historically suspect, fundamentally preposterous and
apparently unaware of its own best dramatic possibilities. Other
than that, it's a straight-ahead thrill machine.
</P>
<P>
   Set in early 1942, soon after the United States entered the war,
the film starts out with a ``Das Boot''-worthy U-boat attack and
destroyer counterstrike (much of the movie, which employed
``Boot's'' production designer Gotz Weidner, is unashamedly
influenced by the great German film _ except, of course, that ``Das
Boot'' wasn't hokey). Left bobbing and powerless somewhere in the
mid-Atlantic (for want of a mechanic ... ), U-571 anxiously awaits
a Nazi resupply sub.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Navy has gotten wind of the ship's predicament, and
a Trojan Horse plan is soon put into action. A World War I vintage
U.S. sub is outfitted to look like a U-boat, a couple of
German-speaking Americans are brought on board, and it's sent out
to rendezvous with U-571. The idea is to get a boarding party onto
the drifter and capture its valuable Enigma encoding machine before
the crew catches on _ and before word can get back to Fortress
Europa that the Allies can break Axis communication codes.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, in real life, the British pulled off
essentially the same maneuver a year earlier, before we were even
in the war.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that things don't go quite according to
plan. Matthew McConaughey's second-in-command, Andrew Tyler, finds
himself in charge of a skeleton crew on the damaged U-boat when its
own ride home is unexpectedly torpedoed.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite ready for captaincy yet, Tyler has one ace up his
sleeve _ a good mechanic! U-571 is soon outmaneuvering and
outfighting shipshape German subs and destroyers, surviving plunges
to depths that should crush it like an accordion and, in general,
winning the war.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is viscerally exciting, as far as it goes. But
without any real idea of who these brave young men are, we're not
exactly wrapped up in their dire fates. McConaughey plays Tyler
with close-cropped hair, sockeyed self-doubt and nary a one of his
movie star smiles. You mainly notice the haircut, and his
interchangeable, expendable crew of co-stars _ Bill Paxton, Harvey
Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi and a bunch of kids who can't be told apart _
have even fewer distinguishing characteristics. When one of them
dies, you have no real clue who's missing.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger casualty, though, is ``U-571's'' most intriguing
premise. These American sailors are dressed like Germans on a
U-boat. Only two of them speak the language, and one of them is an
African-American, played by T.K. Carter. Now wouldn't some close
encounters with unknowingly ``friendly'' Nazi boarders have been
deliciously nerve-wracking (not to mention opportunities for some
of the faceless cast members to stand out as individuals?). And how
about trying to convince Allied planes and ships, whom the
imposters certainly couldn't fight against, not to attack them on
sight?
</P>
<P>
   Such possibilities remain missing in action, however, their
space taken up by more and bigger explosions. Their absence doesn't
exactly sink ``U- 571.'' But they could have plugged some serious
narrative leaks, as any decent script mechanic could tell you. &QL;

   You're falling at 120 mph, terminal velocity. No parachute. No
reserve. There's only one chance to turn this thing around _ ``The
Worst-Case Survival Scenario Handbook,'' a witty how-to manual for
the doomed, the unlucky and the just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The capital letters on Page 137 are reassuring: ``HOW TO SURVIVE
IF YOUR PARACHUTE DOESN'T OPEN.'' Follow steps one through six, and
...
</P>
<P>
   ... Splat. It might have helped to memorize the steps before
putting on a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um,'' says Hollywood stuntman Joe Jennings, a veteran jumper
who helped authors David Borgenicht and Joshua Piven write the
failed parachute scenario.
</P>
<P>
   He hesitates, then chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think to yourself, `At least I read a good book in
my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook'' (Chronicle Books;
$14.95), is a funny and, yes, possibly even a helpful book. All the
advice in it was compiled in detailed interviews with experts in
specific dire straits, from emergency childbirth to jumping from a
five-story building into a dumpster. Maybe it will help you walk on
top of a train, jump from a moving motorcycle to a car or win a
swordfight. Maybe not. ``The Worst- Case Scenario Survival
Handbook'' comes with no guarantees, only a warning (``DO NOT
ATTEMPT TO UNDERTAKE ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK'')
and a disclaimer (``THE PUBLISHER, AUTHORS AND EXPERTS DISCLAIM ANY
LIABILITY'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is all totally real,'' Borgenicht said.
``Sure, the concept is a little off. The odds you'd actually need
to know how to wrestle an alligator and how to jump from a building
into a dumpster and how to treat frostbite and perform a
tracheotomy and fend off a shark are minimal. The odds you'd need
to even know one of those things is minimal, so it's definitely
more of an armchair entertainment book than a serious survival
guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who knows?'' he said. ``It could save your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recent fatal sword attacks in England might have turned out
differently had the victims been familiar with Page 66 of the
Worst-Case book. A poor elderly woman in Florida might be
celebrating another birthday had she only known to thump the snout
of the alligator (page 57) that dragged her into Lake Serenity in
Florida in 1993. And everyone needs to know how to dodge gunfire
(page 143) these days. Danger is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Both Borgenicht, 31, and Piven, 28, are mild-mannered writers
from Philadelphia whose most risky excursions are driving or
sharpening a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   The book was conceived in a mix of paranoia, fear and popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably inspired as much by Indiana Jones and `The
A-Team` and `Die Hard' as anything else,'' Borgenicht said.
``Having spent years watching our action heroes get into and out of
these horrible, life- threatening situations, it made us wonder
what regular folk could do in those situations if we didn't have
the benefit of stunt people and trick photography and cutaway
shots. So we decided to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   They tracked down experts from Mountain Mel, a former U.S. Navy
SEAL who told them how to make a fire without matches, to Chris
Caso, a former UCLA gymnast-turned-stuntman whose high-fall credits
include ``Batman Forever'' and ``The Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They got everything right,'' said Caso, who shared jumping
techniques for perilous leaps into water or a dumpster. He said
reading the book's jumping chapters won't give you a stuntman's
``air sense,'' but it might help prevent a few broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also liked the book. He said his parachute failure
response is far from foolproof, but in a situation where all other
options are exhausted _ why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I would put this out as something to go out and
try, that's for sure,'' he said. ``But it's not impossible. Getting
to another person is a piece of cake. Two people under one chute,
depending on your weight, is another story. It could get ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: In most of the worst-case scenarios, the odds
of limping off with your lover like Bruce Willis in ``Die Hard''
are pretty slim. Think ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The advice ``can save your life,'' Borgenicht said. ``But it may
also result in some sort of bodily injury.'' Neither Borgenicht nor
Piven is rushing out to try out these tips.
</P>
<P>
   They are working on a Worst-Case calendar and a book sequel. And
_ who knows? _ if the price is right, they might just take on an
alligator or a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't actually tried too many of the scenarios,''
Borgenicht said, ``but if the Fox networks wants to offer us a TV
deal to try it, we'll be happy to.''

SUBMARINES ARE `U'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of ``Saving Private Ryan's'' box-office success
stems ``U-571,'' the first of doubtless many films celebrating the
World War II Allies' bravery and sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   But this classically imagined submarine thriller, in which a
group of American sailors hijack a disabled German U-boat in order
to capture its code-encrypting device, almost caused the biggest
rift between wartime partners since Stalin dropped the Iron
Curtain. Compared to the firestorm the project triggered in the
British press, star Matthew McConaughey's absurd misadventure with
bongos and lawmen last autumn was a mere tempest in a tabloid
teapot.
</P>
<P>
   Even though writer-director Jonathan Mostow (``Breakdown'') went
to unparalleled logistical and engineering lengths to create a
``you are there'' sense of life on and under the Atlantic in 1942 _
both the filmmaker and the large cast, which also includes Bill
Paxton, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi, invoke the great 1981
German film ``Das Boot'' as their authenticity inspiration _ he
made the somewhat perverse decision to actually refer to the code
thingie as an Enigma machine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostow well knew that it was a Royal Navy party that
clandestinely seized the first Enigma device in May 1941 _ half a
year before the United States entered the war _ and for the
duration led the way in eavesdropping on what the Nazis thought
were secret communications. While ``U-571'' does not claim to be
even as factual as the fictitious ``Private Ryan,'' word of this
plotline naturally made aged British veterans, who generally
nurture a healthy competitiveness with their Yank comrades over who
contributed most to the war effort, feel rather less than honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``As corny as this sounds, I made this movie with respect and
love in my heart for the men who fought on submarines in World War
II,'' says Mostow. ``The last thing I would ever want would be to
be perceived as trying to infringe on somebody's glory or the
credit for somebody's accomplishments. But I felt that the Enigma
was fair game as a MacGuffin (a term for the item, coined by
English director Alfred Hitchcock, that the characters in a movie
care inordinately about). And this is clearly a work of fiction. To
mention another submarine movie, no one says about `The Hunt for
Red October,' wait a second, the Russians never defected a sub.''
</P>
<P>
   While McConaughey agrees with Mostow's basic defense, like the
director he was obsessed with locating as much heroic realism in
his work as possible. ``I can understand better, see reasons and
motive behind a character, if it's something based in reality,''
says the charismatic Texan, who's done his share of controversial
historical films (``Amistad,'' ``The Newton Boys'') between more
fanciful hits (``Contact,'' ``A Time to Kill''). ``This was based
in World War II. Is it fiction, is it a yarn? Yes. But you can't
conjure up any more extreme circumstances than what these guys were
under in that environment, in a submarine facing depth charges,
depth pressure, torpedoes and destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few times in our history that you can go back to and
just put the straight dope on, that's enough,'' McConaughey adds.
``I mean, the stakes don't get any higher than the reality of this.
So we don't need space ships and lasers and dragons. But today, of
course, there are lots of things, like improved sound and special
effects, that up that drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Filmed early last year in Rome and on and around the
island of Malta in the Mediterranean, the production boasted one
full-size, 600-ton, seagoing replica of a type VII German U-boat
that could do everything but dive (``except once,'' jokes Mostow);
two other full-size mock-ups that were used for scenes shot in a
gigantic outdoor water tank; the largest rain towers ever used in a
film, which sprinkled 15,000 gallons of seawater per minute on the
cold, soaked actors (there was not a big enough supply of fresh
water to be found).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, after months of this kind of work, some cast members
began wondering about their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I was out in that tank more than one night going,
'I'm already rich and famous, why am I rowing this lifeboat?'''
reveals Bon Jovi, the rock music superstar who's been steadily
building an acting career from the bottom up. ``'Get the stunt
rower in here!'''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Mostow, there was no serious complaining
anddefinitely no star trips among the players, who all understood
that their discomfort could not begin to approximate what real
submariners suffered during the war.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the example set by two real submariners, who
acted as technical advisers during the production. One incident
gave the actors an object lesson in just what kind of men it took
to fight in the leaky, cramped and constantly at-risk vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took Vice Adm. Patrick Hannifin and a German U-boat captain,
these two men who had been bitter enemies six decades ago, out to
dinner with a couple of the guys,'' Bon Jovi recalls. ``We didn't
know how they were going to get along. But for some reason, they
related to each other like buddies or brothers because they'd had
this experience and respect for each other. We had to really pay
attention to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, anything more than basic bellyaching was not an
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were questions along the way, not only to me but to all
of the actors, along the lines of, 'Man, when are you gonna
break?''' McConaughey notes. ``But I just didn't want to hear about
it. There was no question; no one was ever gonna break, no one was
gonna be a crybaby, we knew what we were getting in for. Now, if
you want to talk about having a hard time, think about the guys
that were really there, period. What we were out there doing in our
re-creation was a luxury; it was nothing in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   One other engineering marvel also provided relative luxury for
cast and crew. The production installed what was referred to as the
Ferrari of gimbals inside a giant, floodable tank in Europe's
largest soundstage at Rome's Cinecitta Studios. Sections of
submarine interiors could be placed on the agile platform by crane,
where they could then be tilted, shaken and otherwise moved at
whatever angles and speeds the scene called for. Parts of the sub
walls could also be removed to permit long-lens camerawork _ and to
give the more claustrophobic cast members some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest and most sophisticated gimbal that's ever
been built in the world,'' Mostow says. ``It was so big that, one
day, I was walking into the studio and I saw 100 55-gallon drums
sitting outside the soundstage. A guy told me, 'Oh, that's the
hydraulic fluid for the gimbal.' The even more amazing thing was
that it was silent in its operation. And it was all controlled from
this one little box with a little joystick, by this Italian guy in
a beret with a cigarette dangling from his lips. Someone would tell
him to do something in Italian and, all of a sudden, this whole
huge thing would go pow! _ like it had just been hit by a big
depth-charge attack.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are a lot of those, all accompanied by nerve-rattling,
state- of-the-art sonic assaults. Whether or not a different kind
of explosion _ a bad PR blitz _ is awaiting the film in England
remains to be seen. The finished film ends with titles
acknowledging the initial British raid and several others that
resulted in captured Enigmas and other Axis coding devices.
</P>
<P>
   It may well not be enough, but Mostow is at least personally
satisfied with one pre-emptive strike. When the first protests
about the project were voiced during its production, the director
sought out Lt. Cmdr. David Balme, who led the boarding party onto
the U-110 that captured the first Engima machine in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cold-called him one day,'' Mostow says. ``He was upset
about it, but I explained to him what we were trying to do and told
him that I had nothing to hide from him. I brought him down to
Malta, showed him everything _ the script, the whole thing. Then,
when the movie was done, I did something that maybe made the studio
nervous: I invited him to see the movie. If he'd had a problem with
it, it would've been bad P.R. for us. But he loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Entirely? Or does something need to be decoded here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at the end of it, Lt. Balme turned to me and said,
'Jolly good, although I don't remember the war being quite so
noisy,''' Mostow admits. &QL;

<P>
   It wasn't as heroic as commanding a battered submarine under
constant attack. In fact, it was downright embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew McConaughey is bravely trying to laugh off his
arrest last October, in which police responding to a noise
complaint entered the actor's Austin, Texas, home after observing
him through a window playing bongos in the nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference in making a joke out of something and
having a sense of humor about it,'' the tall, 30-year-old Texan
notes. ``It happened and I got a sense of humor about it, man. It
made it easier coming out of jail the first time, going, `You know
what, Matthew? I can't figure out anything wrong you did. It's all
right. You've done it before and you'll do it again. If everyone
can't see the absurdity of this then I don't want to know them
anyway.' I just want to keep it simple. I think everyone kind of
agrees it's just ... silly.''
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey was cuffed for telling the officers to get out of
his house and charged with drug paraphernalia possession and
resisting transportation. The drug charge was dropped almost
immediately and the resisting one a few weeks later, when
McConaughey agreed to pay a $50 fine for the noise violation.
</P>
<P>
   But as absurd as the whole situation obviously was, the actor
can't help but feel a little violated himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, how did we get from a class-C noise infraction
into jail cuffed?'' he asks rhetorically. ``Even the judge _ and I
think everybody, when they stop and think about it after the humor
_ has to go, 'Wait a minute? They came in your house?' No, that's
not right, that's not how anything needs to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against the blue and I don't want anyone to be against
them, man,'' he says. ``We need law and order. But there was a
place where this one person got out of line.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past 10 years, it sometimes felt as if Cracker might
be the last honest-to-goodness rock band on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetically sticking to verse-chorus-verse songs in the
traditional guitars-and-drums format, the group embodied the
classic-rock gold standard at a time when pop became increasingly
fragmented and unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   Led by ex-Camper Van Beethoven singer-guitarist David Lowery and
guitarist-singer Johnny Hickman, Cracker travels a relatively
mainstream path and scored radio hits with the tuneful ``Low'' and
``Euro-Trash Girl'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years and four albums, Cracker's just-issued ``Garage
D'Or'' (Virgin) is a collection of radio hits, new studio tracks,
soundtrack-only offerings and oddities. The disc represents a
decade in the life of one of the few '90s bands to have impacted
die-hard rock fans and their alternative-leaning cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put it together in an odd sort of way,'' Lowery explained
from his home in Richmond, Va. ``First, we polled our fans through
e-mail and made a list of about a dozen songs they wanted. We
weren't exactly looking for our greatest hits. It was more like
what songs you'd use to introduce somebody to Cracker. It turned
out entirely different from what I would have imagined. Our friends
say it's the definitive Cracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Cracker's chemistry is the partnership between Lowery
and Hickman, longtime friends who moved from Santa Cruz to Virginia
at the start of the '90s to launch their new band.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the crudest terms, I sing something and he plays something
and it's like a foil to what I do,'' Lowery, 39, said. ``There's
always a dialogue going on between us. He comes from a more
down-and-dirty, rootsy-folky side than me ... an earthier side of
things. My songs can seem kind of spacy until he starts putting
parts on them.''
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the regular-issue release of the 16-track
``Garage D'Or,'' a bonus disc of oddities and live tracks is
available on a limited- edition basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an odd sense of humor,'' Lowery said of his often
ironic lyrics. ``I like the way people speak as opposed to how they
write. I like the way written English is entirely different from
spoken English. Sometimes when I write a song, I'll take something
I've overheard and take a phrase and it will imply a character and
then I'll let the character speak. There's this one dominant
narrative style in rock _ 'what I did on my sixth-grade vacation' _
but if you look at rap or country, those forms of music play with
the narrative voice. I look for absurdity, sarcasm and irony. It
doesn't seem that weird to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracker, augmented by extra musicians, plays about 100 shows a
year, including a recent, packed date at the House of Blues. And
while the band has a high profile in Europe, Lowery feels the group
should focus on more familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I should spend my royalties to go play for
the French,'' the good-natured singer joked.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Lowery owns what he calls ``the only professional
recording studio in town.'' Richmond, he adds, has a busy
college-oriented music scene that spawned local hero Dave Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town gets no press because there's not a particular sound,
so you never hear about it like you did with Seattle,'' he said.
``There's a lot of neat stuff going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the band's mid-'90s radio success, Lowery is pleased
Cracker has held onto a loyal cult audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 16 years in the business, I've learned to be quite jaded
in my own twisted way,'' he said. ``The radio stations have these
annual festivals full of one-hit wonder bands, yet we get offered
to play them, too. And I always say, `You played one song by us in
10 years.' But they pay us, and we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That one song was ``Low,'' recorded for Cracker's sophomore
``Kerosene Hat'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember feeling really strongly about that song,'' Lowery
said. ``I was talking to Johnny in the studio, and I said once we
get a really good take of `Low,' we would be 50 percent done with
the record. We had the music for a while, and I remember playing
around with it at sound check on our first tour. When we began
performing it in concert, I noticed people really liked it. It's
rare that you play a new song and people really react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cracker's other really popular song, ``Euro-Trash Girl,''
which began life as a word-of-mouth hit _ since it wasn't listed on
the ``Kerosene Hat'' album credits _ Lowery says it still draws
people to the band's shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not listing the song made it more important in a weird way,
although that wasn't our intention,'' he said. ``We knew we should
include it, but the label thought the record was getting too long.
So I told our producer to put it on the album but not to list it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It intrigued people because it was kind of a hidden thing.'' &QL;

LILA KEDROVA, 82, PLAYED THE FRENCH COCOTTE IN `ZORBA' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada, France, Russia, Britain, Italy)  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an
aging French cocotte in screen and stage versions of ``Zorba the
Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in
Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.
</P>
<P>
   Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not
reported by news agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England,
Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a
French Cesar for the film ``Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the
Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ``The Cherry
Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar)
for ``Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in
Sicily for the film ``Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Kedrova was best
known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ``Zorba.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos
Kazantzakis novel ``Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony
Quinn, Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying
mistress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a
wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still
hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his
review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   When she re-created her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of
The Times described Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ``a small, round,
smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat
``her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing
flirtatiousness.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see
the young `cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see
that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we
do. No wonder Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''
</P>
<P>
   The role that won Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress
and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first
offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone
Signoret.
</P>
<P>
   But, Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Signoret
withdrew, and Cacoyannis telephoned Kedrova in Paris to invite her
to join his cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she
told The Times of London some years ago. ``It was a fascinating
role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this
vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I
must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her
mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found
I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win
the Academy Award.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one other problem, Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a
profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Cacoyannis called, he
asked if Kedrova spoke English.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ``And I
replied, `Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung
and expressions like ``How do you do?'' and ``Thank you,'' she got
the part.
</P>
<P>
   Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a
distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of
the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ``Once
I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling
a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ``When I was 12,
I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do.
And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they
allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris,
who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my
parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized
that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''
</P>
<P>
   So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who
became her first husband.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s she began to achieve critical and popular
success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like
``The Rose Tattoo,'' ``A View From the Bridge,'' ``A Taste of
Honey'' and ``The Brothers Karamazov.''
</P>
<P>
   Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married
in 1969, said that Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors,
made her last stage appearance in the early 1990s at the Chichester
Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in
Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Some reference books listed Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and
Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found
elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left
their papers behind. The false papers they were given in France
were confiscated by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked it that way,'' Howard said of her agelessness. ``I
remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could
choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be
16.''

SPARKY HAS LIVED QUITE A LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He grew up near the corner of Vermont and 35th near the Memorial
Coliseum, and he remembers riding the Red Cars and attending fights
at the Olympic Auditorium and watching movies at the Orpheum and
United Artists on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers serving as a batboy for Gene Mauch's baseball team
at Fremont High and gathering with young pals behind the Shrine
Auditorium where differences would be settled with fists.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers going out to 42nd and Avalon where Wrigley Field
was located and where the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast
League would play their home games.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers going out to Fairfax and Beverly where Gilmore
Field was located and where the Hollywood Stars of the PCL would
play their home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, what days!'' he says nostalgically. Great days. Memorable
days. Wonderful days. Little did I know one day I'd play in the
PCL.''
</P>
<P>
   George ``Sparky'' Anderson would do more than play professional
baseball, including being employed as a second baseman for the
Angels in their final PCL season in 1957 a year before the arrival
of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1953 graduate of Dorsey High would go on to become one of
the legendary managers of the sport during his nine seasons with
the Cincinnati Reds and his 17 with the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   His Cincinnati teams were known as the Big Red Machine, and they
were among the most fearsome in baseball history with names like
Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Tony Perez, Ken Griffey, Dave
Concepcion, George Foster and others dotting the roster.
</P>
<P>
   His Detroit teams also were formidable with people like Kirk
Gibson and Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker and Lance Parrish,
although the ones near the end of his career struggled.
</P>
<P>
   But Sparky Anderson was more than just an extraordinary field
commander. Like another old school baseball graduate, Tom Lasorda,
Anderson became a much-quoted goodwill ambassador for a game he so
passionately liked and became a popular fixture among the media,
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   And, on July 23rd at Cooperstown, N.Y., Sparky Anderson will be
awarded for his achievements that included two World Series titles
with the Reds and one with the Tigers by being inducted into the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate honor for anyone who is involved with
baseball,'' says Anderson, who also will be honored Saturday night
at the Great Sports Legends Awards banquet for the Paralysis
Project of America at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson is now 66, and still lives in Thousand
Oaks---he's lived there the past 34 years with wife Carol---and
still offers candid opinions on varying subjects just as he did
when he was overseeing the Reds or Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson thinks it's a terrible injustice that the most prolific
batsman in all the seasons of baseball, Pete Rose---he wound up
with 4,256 hits---doesn't already have his plaque hanging in the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can show me a piece of paper that proves that Pete was
gambling on baseball when he was a player, then I might look at it
differently,'' he says. ``He should be voted in for what he did as
a player, and, believe me, he was hardest-playing player I ever
had, with Kirk Gibson second. Pete showed up to play every day,
never took it easy, played hard all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has faults. Sure, Pete might have his, but I have
mine. No one is perfect. Before a season would start, I'd always
gather up my players and say, `Gentlemen, we have some talent on
this team. If you can tolerate me, I can tolerate you. And you all
have to tolerate each other.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimneysakes, Pete Rose isn't Jack the Ripper. No one ever has
said he altered the outcome of a game. We shouldn't be so
judgmental of other people. Pete should be given another chance. He
ain't like me, but that doesn't make him worse or better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson still thinks his Big Red Machine teams were the
strongest he's seen, but he has fond admiration for the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see how the Yankees do for the next five years
before I put them ahead of our Red teams,'' he says. ``The Yankees
might have a little better pitching than we did, but I don't think
anyone had a better starting lineup. But you have to give a lot of
credit to the job Joe Torre and Don Zimmer have done with the
Yankees. All their players know how to play the game properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had staggering success as a manager---his 1975 Red team
went 108-52---and also great frustration---his 1989 Tiger team went
59-103--- and never took himself seriously, one of his alluring
charms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the players who do it for you, but you have to get them
to the watering trough,'' he says. ``You just have to let them
play. I'll never forget Charlie Dressen (one-time Brooklyn Dodger
manager) saying to me, `I'll tell you anything you want to know
about managing, but, please, ask me the day after the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of managers. One who has bad players,
loses games, and gets fired. Then there's the Einstein. One who has
good players, leaves them alone, lets them win, and stays around a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson was only 35 when he was hired to manage the Reds
in the winter of 1969, and he was 60 when he departed the scene
with the Tigers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just realized that I had had my time in the sun, and it was
someone else's turn,'' he says. Sure, there are times I miss the
wars and the players. But I don't miss all the politics upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't off somewhere giving speeches to corporate groups
and fraternal organizations, Anderson maintains a regular routine
in Thousand Oaks, walking an hour each morning before playing golf
at nearby Sunset Hills.
</P>
<P>
   He weighs a trim 155, 10 pounds less than when he managed.
</P>
<P>
   He says Roberto Clemente was the best player he ever saw, but
admits he didn't see Willie Mays and Hank Aaron in their primes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never seen a player who could do as many things on a
ball field as Joe Morgan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a lot of others in athletics who depart high profile
positions, he doesn't attempt to remain in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see him renewing acquaintances at Dodger Stadium or
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I was doing broadcasting with the Angels, I never
went down on the field,'' he says. I don't want my presence to be a
distraction. I had my time on the baseball fields. Now it's time
for others to enjoy the experience.''

LOUISIANA TRIAL DISSECTS IMAGE OF FORMER GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
  By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Desperate to procure Louisiana's final
riverboat gambling license in 1997, Edward DeBartolo Jr. had
already delivered $400,000 in cash to his father's old friend,
Edwin Edwards, the former governor of Louisiana. He had fended off
suggestions that he grant consulting contracts worth millions more
to Edwards and his eldest son, Stephen. And then, according to
court testimony, even after DeBartolo's partnership won its state
casino license, he received another proposal, this time for a
$10,000-a-month attorney's retainer for Stephen Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, could
not have been more exasperated. ``They don't quit,'' he complained
to his closest associate, Ed Muransky, according to Muransky's
testimony in Edwards' racketeering trial here.
</P>
<P>
   Distilled into three syllables, that is the essence of the case
that federal prosecutors have laid bare against Edwards, who some
consider to be Louisiana's official state rogue, in a captivating
four-month trial that will go to the jury next week. In testimony
about five separate casino licensing extortion schemes, the
prosecution has portrayed the 72-year-old Edwards as relentlessly,
reflexively, almost pathologically corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you grow up with an insatiable greed for things, for
material things,'' said Michael W. Magner, an assistant U.S.
attorney, who compared Edwards to a compulsive cookie thief during
closing arguments on Tuesday. ``The key word is insatiable. It's
never satisfied. The more you have, the more you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, of course, has been so thoroughly investigated over the
years that many Louisianans said in interviews that this trial had
barely altered their perception of him. But the casino case has
clearly provided the richest portrait ever presented of Edwards'
unconventional blending of politics and business.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his two trials in the 1980s, one of which ended in a
mistrial and the other in an acquittal, in this case, Edwards has
had to contend with hundreds of hours of audiotapes produced by
clandestine wiretaps. Prosecutors also had the benefit of extensive
testimony from DeBartolo and two other former business associates
who turned state's evidence against Edwards as part of their plea
bargains with the government. Each testified that they made payoffs
either to Edwards or to other defendants who they assumed were
paying a share to Edwards in exchange for his help in winning
riverboat gambling licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his son, Stephen, and five other defendants that
prosecutors characterized as the former governor's cronies and bag
men, Edwards is charged in a 33-count indictment with heading a
moblike enterprise that conspired to extort millions of dollars
from businessmen seeking riverboat licenses. The shakedowns took
place both during Edwards' final term and after he left office in
1996, when he still exerted tremendous influence over legislators
and gaming commission members, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo may have provided the most damaging testimony, telling
jurors that Edwards wrote ``$400,000'' on a scrap of paper and
pushed it across a restaurant table as the men discussed
DeBartolo's pursuit of a Louisiana casino license. Edwards
maintained that the money was a legitimate consulting fee and that
DeBartolo insisted on paying in cash to hide his association with
Edwards from his business partners.
</P>
<P>
   Another businessman, Robert Guidry, a wealthy tugboat operator
who was seeking a licensing hearing for a casino he hoped to open,
testified that he made $1.5 million in payoffs to the Edwardses,
sometimes leaving stacks of $100 bills in paper bags deposited in
garbage bins. Guidry testified that the deal was negotiated in 1994
by one of Edwards' gubernatorial aides, Andrew Martin, and was
sealed in a face-to-face meeting with the governor in a hotel
conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand you and Andrew got an understanding,'' Edwards
told Guidry, according to Guidry's testimony. ``I'm going to see
about getting you your hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors heard prosecutors depict Edwards as a man who was
both audaciously bold and exceedingly cautious, who endlessly
hatched plots to enrich himself but typically delegated the
riskiest work to middlemen and cloaked his intentions in code. He
covered his tracks, prosecutors said, by taking payments in cash,
transporting it cross-country in a money vest and then spending it
lavishly. Thousands of $100 bills were spent on his home, a ranch,
furniture, landscaping, an airplane, yachts and diamond earrings.
Prosecutors place the total earnings from the schemes at nearly $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   One tape recording seems to catch Edwards in a plot to launder
cash payments by falsely inflating rental payments that Guidry
would make for the use of a tugboat. Another captures him advising
former Rep. Cleo Fields on how to conceal a $20,000 cash payment
from Edwards by disguising it as a campaign donation from a friend.
A third tape reveals Edwards asking DeBartolo for tickets to the
1997 Super Bowl that prosecutors say he then scalped for $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Wednesday, Edwards' lawyer, Dan Small,
warned the jurors that all was not as it appeared, and that
prosecutors had built a case long on suspicion and short on proof.
``The government has put on a case based on gossip, innuendo and
lies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's strongest witnesses, including DeBartolo, had
fabricated testimony in order to secure plea bargain agreements,
Small contended, and the prosecution had manufactured a sinister
spin for innocent comments caught on the tapes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bewildering thing, prosecutors suggested, is that by
virtually any measure, certainly by the standards of his
impoverished Cajun childhood, Edwards seemed to be doing well
enough. By the time he left office, he was worth an estimated $4
million to $5 million, according to prosecutors. He lived in one of
Baton Rouge's most exclusive neighborhoods with his second wife,
Candy, who is 35.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the 1980s, he had escaped conviction on charges that he
took payoffs to exert his influence _ while out of office _ to help
various patrons win state hospital licenses. By his own count, he
had been investigated by 22 grand juries. The trials took a
political toll. He lost his re-election bid in 1987 and then won
the office back in 1991, though perhaps only because his ultimate
opponent was David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through it all, Edwards remained Louisiana's lovable
scoundrel, damaged but not defeated, re-elected rather than
reviled. Why press his luck? the prosecution asked in its closing
argument. Why such hubris? Why not quit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine you're the smartest kid around and you've got a silver
tongue that can talk your way out of everything,'' Magner told the
jury. That effortless charm, when combined with Edwards' lust for
money, bred arrogance, Magner said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors pleaded with the jurors to not let Edwards get away
again, to not let him defraud them as he had defrauded their state.
``You must avoid the snares of deceit and clever lies and devilish
charm,'' said Jim Letten, the lead prosecutor. Edwards, he said,
was shrewd but also unburdened by conscience or remorse. ``He's
cold,'' Letten said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Edwards can talk his way out of his latest troubles
remains to be seen. He gave it his best shot last week, when he
spent four days on the stand, the only defendant to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the governor of the state,'' he told the jury as he
denied all the charges against him . ``That was a wonderful
achievement for me. I wasn't going to demean my office by hustling
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his testimony on Friday, Edwards sought to
impress upon the jury that he could spend the rest of his life in
jail. ``I'm 72 years old,'' he said, in response to questioning by
his own lawyer. ``I've already lived my biblically allotted time.
Statistically, I have about five or six years. If I'm lucky, maybe
eight or nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Letten quickly objected to Edwards' monologue, and U.S. District
Court Judge Frank Polozola put an end to it. Minutes later, Edwards
finished his testimony. As he headed toward the defense table, he
stopped by Letten's chair, leaned over and whispered with enough
volume to be heard by spectators: ``You missed a good speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury seems to be taking its responsibilities with deadly
seriousness, maintaining a stern composure even as spectators
chuckle at Edwards' antics. But for no other reason than that this
is the way it has always been, many Louisianans assume that Edwards
will go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's crooked but he's going to get off,'' said John
Franklin, a 65-year-old retired store owner who was interviewed
Wednesday morning in New Orleans. ``They never got him before and
they don't have him now.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most of those interviewed said the trial had only
reinforced Edwards' existing reputation, some said the prosecution
had succeeded in changing his image from that of a harmless scamp
to something more malevolent. ``Let's face it, this is Louisiana
and people kind of enjoy things like this,'' said Joe Knight, a
36-year-old New Orleans artist. ``But there have been moments when
people realize just how serious this is.''

MARKETPLACE: BARRING ANOTHER DIVE, LASTING DAMAGE IS LIKELY TO BE
MINIMAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock prices have regained some of their lost ground, but the
enormous hit to wealth last week is likely to knock the nation's
economy only partly off its stride _ unless the rout on Wall Street
resumes in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   From early January through last Friday, sell-offs have destroyed
an estimated $2 trillion to $3 trillion in total wealth, including
$1.5 trillion in household savings. Most of that was wiped out in
last week's steep decline.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the household decline over the roughly half the
population that owns stocks and the loss averaged more than $12,000
a person. What if that turned out to be long-lasting, and each
foray upward in stock prices soon gave way to another slide, as
this week's rally began to do Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market stays just where it was, there will be weeks of
news media discussion about what went wrong and a lot of
person-to-person conversation,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale
economist whose new book, ``Irrational Exuberance,'' argues that
stock markets are driven in large part by emotion and mimicry.
``People learn what to do from one another.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk, the damage to the overall economy is
likely to be minimal _ unless markets take another severe dive,
pushing stock gauges well below their lows so far this year. If the
market merely fails to rebound, the growth rate of the economy
should slow by this summer to about 3.6 percent, compared with last
year's growth of 4.6 percent, according to estimates by
Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis firm whose computer simulations
of the economy's expected behavior are widely followed by
government officials and economists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the firm's projections, the unemployment rate could drift
gradually upward to 4.5 percent next year from 4.1 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers tend to respond fairly quickly to sharp declines in
household wealth,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, senior economist at
Macroeconomic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that downshift represents only a comparatively modest
deceleration from the 4.2 percent growth Macroeconomic Advisers
expected in the absence of a stock market correction. The red-hot
American economy was already projected to cool off slightly in
response to a series of interest rate increases engineered by the
Federal Reserve. There have been five quarter-point rate increases
in the federal funds rate since last June, and Macroeconomic
Advisers allows for more, pushing the current level beyond 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assumes that stock prices move sideways for six months,''
Matheny said. ``If there is another big correction in the next few
weeks, then we could seriously entertain the possibility that the
Fed won't tighten again, and might even ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Fed does, the market downturn is likely to arouse
much more debate about interest rate policy. With the gross
domestic product expanding at more than 4 percent on average in
recent years, and much more in recent months, the Fed's rate
increases have met with relatively little opposition. To most
economists, the demand for goods and services seems to be
outstripping supply, threatening inflationary shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But if growth slows to around 3.5 percent, partly in response to
weakness on Wall Street, that could bring the nation's increase in
economic output within the range that many experts believe is
sustainable without risking a serious escalation in prices. In that
case, the Fed may not have to lift interest rates very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's play with one percentage point of economic growth,''
said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a former
vice chairman of the Fed. ``To the extent the stock market takes
this purchasing power away, the Fed has less to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark is the extent to which the so-called
wealth effect will come into play. While some experts think such
estimates are exaggerated, the rule of thumb held that on the way
up, consumers spent perhaps 3 to 5 cents more for each dollar of
increase in their households' stock portfolios. But some new
research suggests that on the way down, the pullback in spending
might be greater than 3 to 5 cents _ concentrated in high-end
merchandise like luxury cars, jewelry, watches, boats and the like.
</P>
<P>
   While the spending of high-end households is hit the hardest,
changes in stock prices appear to ``affect spending by households
that do not own stock because they affect consumer confidence,''
James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, reports in an article soon to be published in the
Journal of Economic Perspectives. ``Unfortunately, the only way to
learn more about these effects may be by experiencing a downturn in
stock market values.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, estimates
that the stock market wealth effect added about three-quarters of a
percentage point to economic growth over the last year. ``What
stimulated spending will soon evaporate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from consumption, the downward pressure on economic growth
from an enduring stock market correction comes from changes to
capital spending, stock options, pension fund contributions and
debt. As consumption eases, so does the pressure to expand
production through capital investment in new equipment. Less demand
means less output, and capital spending may fall about 15 percent
short of projections this year in response to the market downturn,
Matheny said.
</P>
<P>
   The economy could take another hit if stock options become less
popular. The companies that issue these options do not have to
carry them as a labor cost until they are cashed in. But in a
market that is moving sideways or down, stock options lose their
appeal and employees may press for cash raises or bonuses. These do
count as a labor cost, cutting into profits that drive expansion
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies will take a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Rhoda
Edelman, managing director of Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners Inc., a firm
that advises companies on compensation practices. ``But there is a
potential for higher labor costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, rising stock prices have increased the value of
corporate pension funds in recent years, thus reducing or
eliminating the need for cash contributions. The market correction,
if it holds, means that companies will have to inject additional
cash, cutting further into profits.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest unknown is what will happen to heavily indebted
families, many of which borrowed against the value of their homes
or stock portfolios to pay for consumption or the purchase of more
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people must feel vulnerable if the stock market
correction holds and therefore the flow of borrowing is likely to
be lower,'' said Wynne Godley, an economist and debt expert at the
Jerome Levy Economics Institute. ``If the flow is lower, spending
will be lower. We don't know the magnitudes yet, but that is the
central point.''

CUBAN AMERICANS CHEER A COURT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBAN-BOY)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the crisp, navy blue T-shirts of the private Our Lady
of the Rosary School, 16 children, 3 to 5 years old, fidgeted with
their beads and pressed their hands in prayer at the chain-link
fence in front of Elian Gonzalez's home in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for the children of all nations,'' Teresa Hernandez,
the school's director of the evangelization program, said into her
bullhorn. ``We pray for President Clinton to be guided and
enlightened by the Holy Spirit. We pray to the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Then at 2:45 p.m., before the children could say ``Amen,'' a
deafening, joyous roar rose from the 200 or 300 Cuban Americans
keeping vigil on the street. A federal appeals court had determined
that Elian could remain in the United States at least a while
longer, until an asylum hearing next month. The ruling, upholding
an earlier stay, was the latest in a series of victories for
Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two men in the crowd, the first to hear of the ruling, leaped
from the barricades and hugged. ``He is saved!'' someone cried.
Members of Mothers Against Repression, clad in black and wearing
straw hats to fend off the sun, wiped tears and linked hands in a
circle to pray. Horns blared. People formed a procession and
chanted, ``Elian no se va''_ Elian will not go _ and ``Fidel
loco.''
</P>
<P>
   To cheers, Elian's great-uncle, who has defied federal officials
by refusing to turn the boy over to his father, bounded out of the
patch of lawn inside his fence. Lazaro Gonzalez, a part-time car
mechanic, about 5-foot-6, broad-shouldered and compact, was wearing
a red form-fitting T-shirt tucked into the waist of his jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gonzalez family continues to believe in the laws of the
United States,'' Lazaro Gonzalez told the crowd. ``We will continue
to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was nowhere in sight at first, but soon he came out,
played on his swing set and high-fived his cousin, Marisleysis,
Lazaro Gonzalez's 21-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   As the news circulated, people saw this as another skirmish won,
not the war. Attorney General Janet Reno could still try to turn
the child over to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has been
waiting in Bethesda, Md., to regain custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Wednesday was by a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta. The federal
government could seek to have the stay lifted by the full court or
by a Supreme Court justice. Or it could wait until a scheduled May
11 hearing before the federal appeals court on the asylum request
by the Miami relatives. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
had denied that request.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is all we've been asking for _ his day in court,''
said Luis Montoto, 42, who emigrated from Cuba when he was 11. ``If
the court rules that he goes back to Cuba, whether we like it or
not, he goes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fernandez, a 38-year-old teacher who arrived here when he
was 8, said, ``This is a small victory in this long battle. All the
time people have said that we don't have a leg to stand on, but
this proves our system of government works.''
</P>
<P>
   But something else might be at work here, too, many vigil
keepers said. As the cheers for the ruling subsided, Hernandez
lifted her megaphone again to give thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise the Lord!'' she said. ``Praise the Lord! Praise the
Lord!'' She led the children in singing ``Jesus Loves the Little
Children'' and the chorus to ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   As she led the children off, a 5-year-old boy named Chi-Chi
explained why he came today. ``So Elian could stay here,'' Chi-Chi
said. ``In Cuba, they don't have freedom and cannot pray.''

REYNOLDS TO PROMOTE CIGARETTE AS POSING LOWER CANCER RISK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Texas)  By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holding Co. said Wednesday that it
would start promoting one of its brands as posing a potentially
lower risk of cancer and chronic bronchitis than traditional
cigarettes, the first time that a producer has made such
advertising claims.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the company said they would make the claims in
connection with its Eclipse cigarette, a brand that heats rather
than burns tobacco. The brand has been on the market for five years
but has found few customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's claims are the first in what may be a new thrust
by tobacco producers in the coming years to develop and market
cigarettes that could pose reduced health risks to smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's action quickly came under criticism from
antismoking groups and others who said there were no independent
scientific criteria to determine what constituted a reduced-risk
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a spokeswoman for the Philip Morris Cos., the
nation's largest cigarette maker, said it did not intend to make
reduced-risk claims for any of its current or future products until
a federal regulatory plan was in place to assess the issue. Philip
Morris has urged that the government be given authority over such
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds officials said they believed that they had strong
data to support their claim and that they would start test
marketing the new advertising campaign this week in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to tell smokers about the potential benefits of
Eclipse and see if they are interested in switching,'' Andrew J.
Schlinder, chairman of R.J. Reynolds told a meeting of company
shareholders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would make direct mailings about
Eclipse to doctors and other medical professionals so they could
discuss the product with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Eclipse, the major brands of the company, which is in
Winston-Salem, N.C., are Winston, Salem and Camel.
</P>
<P>
   David Townsend, the company's vice president of product and
process development, said in an interview that the claims for
Eclipse were based on new scientific data including studies
involving a small number of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that such data had been reviewed by an
independent panel of experts it had retained and that a summary of
their findings had been submitted for publication in a scientific
journal. It declined to disclose the names of all panel members or
the journal's name.
</P>
<P>
   A special carbon tip on Eclipse smolders, creating a minimum of
smoke with less tar, a full dose of nicotine but high levels of
carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   The company's advertisements emphasize that quitting smoking is
the best way to reduce tobacco risks but add that Eclipse ``may
pose less risk of cancer'' to smokers and that it ``reduces
respiratory inflammation,'' which ``may lower risk of chronic
bronchitis and possibly emphysema.''
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette could, however, increase the risk of heart disease
to smokers and complications to pregnant women who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Some antismoking groups attacked the new promotions as
self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without an independent government agency to verify these
claims there is no scientific way to verify RJR's claim that they
have developed a cigarette that can save lives,'' said Matthew
Myers, an official with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago, tobacco makers implied that cigarettes with
lower levels of tar and nicotine than traditional ones might also
pose a reduced risk to smokers. Because smokers tended to drag more
deeply on those cigarettes they produced a certain type of lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court recently ruled that the federal Food and Drug
Administration did not have any authority over cigarette producers
or claims that they might make in connection with their products.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services said in a
statement that the government had significant concerns about the
company's marketing plans. ``It is not at all clear that a
sufficient science base exists to support a bold claim that this
tobacco product may reduce the risk of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has taken action on other tobacco
advertisements that it believes are misleading or deceptive
including some advertisements for R.J. Reynolds cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Peeler, associate director of advertising at the commission
said the agency had not seen the new Eclipse advertisements and
declined to say whether the agency planned to investigate them.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds officials said they had met recently with
officials of both the food and drug agency and the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and provided them with health
data about Eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn, who is presiding over several tobacco lawsuits, asked
lawyers for tobacco companies and smokers on Tuesday to see if they
could develop a plan to resolve all smoking litigation nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that such a plan could prove extremely
difficult to make but that the initiative could lead to a new round
of settlement talks.

SPORTS COLUMN: SORRY, WRONG NUMBER IF YOU'RE CALLING THE 1999
KNICKS  
 WILLIAM C. RHODEN  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Knicks closed out their regular season in Boston
Wednesday night. They did so quietly, without incident.
</P>
<P>
   This was an efficient, workmanlike resolution. Last year, in a
lockout-shortened season, the abbreviated schedule forced a mad
sprint to the finish. This season was a long, boring grind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was something dramatically different about the Knicks
this season _ perhaps an odd, updated, up-tempo version of the
``Knicks basketball'' that evolved in the late '60s and '70s:
intelligent team play, distinguished by ball movement and wise
passing. The concept underwent a major overhaul in 1999 but
returned, as fundamentals always do.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, the sky nearly caved in on the Knicks.
On April 19, they lost to Philadelphia, 72-67, their season-high
fourth consecutive loss. With eight games left, the Knicks were in
danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in 12 season
</P>
<P>
   Writers used phrases like ``broken-down machine'' to describe
the Knicks and said the team was ``filled with flaws and defects.''
There were calls to trade Patrick Ewing and fire coach Jeff Van
Gundy. Ewing said that if the coach were fired, he wanted to be
traded.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the nasty internal feuds that had festered in
and out of public view came to a head when Dave Checketts,
president of Madison Square Garden, fired Ernie Grunfeld as Knicks
president and appointed himself to run the club.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Knicks were exhilarating, intriguing, compelling. This
season's Knicks are better, yet on the surface, they seem boring.
</P>
<P>
   But we've been given the most riveting drama of their season in
an otherwise unspectacular season: the silent movie of Ewing's
return.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing tore his Achilles' tendon during the playoffs last spring,
and the injury was the defining point _ some say the turning point
_ of the Knicks' season and yet another turning point in Ewing's
career.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are in the spring of 2000 and Ewing has climbed a steep
mountain to get back to playoffs. He's endured an excruciating
process of healing: waited for the tendon to heal and listened to
biting criticism that the Knicks might not have reached the NBA
finals last year had he been with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the critics who wrote the Knicks off last season are
predicting gloom against Toronto, their first-round opponent. Van
Gundy is the greatest gloom leader of all. He points out that
Toronto has beaten up on the Knicks for two seasons now. The
Raptors are young and athletic, with a superstar in Vince Carter,
the heir apparent to Jordan, and a hardened veteran in Charles
Oakley, the former Knick.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are not a one-day fling. A team doesn't zip in for
a game then zip out to face another opponent in another city.
Playoff series eliminate luck and ensure that the best team wins.
Toronto will have to be the best team, not just on one night but on
three, four or five nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks whom Toronto will face have gone from a team playing
largely on emotion _ improvising the script as it went along _ to a
methodical team dispensing emotion when needed, riding the highs
the lows with matter-of-factness and brevity. The dramatic sense of
urgency that existed this time last season has been replaced by an
intense but unstated sense of mission.
</P>
<P>
   This, more than anything else about the Knicks, is the handiwork
of Patrick Ewing. His harshest critics concede that his greatest
virtue _ underlined this season _ is resiliency. Will we say that
about Vince Carter in 2015?
</P>
<P>
   Carter is too young to know the rivers Ewing has known: long
summers of rehabilitation, the process of gradually feeling his way
back, exploring the range of what can and cannot be done with
skills diminished by age and eroded by injury. Finally this season,
shedding part of a superstar's ego, discovering when to let the
team carry him, when to carry his team. Finally the payoff:
barreling into April and reaching this point, where it all began
for the Knicks last time around. And ended for Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had the Knicks' number during the regular season. But
they are entering the playoffs _ a time of career-defining moments
of sports life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, I'll take my chances with Ewing. The
young Raptors will dial the Knicks' number they used to have and
receive heartbreaking news that it has been disconnected.  &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI _ Champagne and exhilaration washed along the street in
Little Havana Wednesday, as a federal appeals court not only
extended an order that will keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the
United States until the court hears the full appeal of his case,
but strongly criticized the way government officials had handled
his request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Wednesday
barred anyone from taking Elian out of the country until the court
hears the child's case on May 11, and, in pointed language,
suggested that his Miami relatives' efforts to have his request for
asylum heard in court should not have been ignored. The ruling
ensures that questions of who rightfully speaks for the boy and
whether he is entitled to apply for asylum will be fully aired.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges wrote that they ``doubt that protecting a
party's day in court, when he has an appeal of arguable merit, is
contrary to the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in a legal sense, only a ruling on an emergency
injunction to keep the child in this country for a few more weeks,
but the judges' language seemed to chastise the government for its
claim that only the boy's father is legally entitled to speak for
him, and it lent credence to the Miami family's argument that the
small boy is a bona fide candidate for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to pray,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, who defied a federal order last week to give up the
boy and bring him to an airport for eventual reunification with his
Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Miami house, demonstrators celebrated with geysers of
champagne and quiet prayers over tightly clenched rosaries. ``It's
a victory for the Cuban people,'' said Francisca G. Espinosa, 68, a
retiree who lives on Miami Beach. It was unclear if she was
referring to Cubans on this side of the Florida Straits, the other
side or to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not answer a key question: who should have
custody of Elian while the legal process plays out. The Justice
Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have
insisted that Elian be reunited with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who is waiting for his child at a Cuban diplomat's house
outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Avoidance of that issue, Attorney General Janet Reno said, left
her the option of removing the boy from his uncle's home _ as she
has threatened to do for days. But Wednesday night, it remained
unclear whether she would take such a step, and officials inside
the department indicated they had been surprised by the court's
decision and were confused about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's order does not preclude me from placing Elian in
his father's care while he is in the United States,'' said Attorney
General Janet Reno, as she stepped off a plane in Oklahoma City,
where she had gone to attend a memorial service for victims of the
bombing of the federal building there five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five months after the boy was found floating on an inner
tube off the coast of Florida in a failed crossing from Cuba that
drowned his mother and 10 others, Elian remained encircled
Wednesday night by demonstrators at the house in Miami, many of
whom have said they will simply not allow the boy to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take and consider all our options and take the
course of action that we deem appropriate under the
circumstances,'' said Reno, leaving open the possibility that
federal officials might _ somehow _ still remove the boy from the
Miami house.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the reunion of father and son seemed assured. In
March, a U.S. district court judge in Miami upheld an Immigration
and Naturalization Service order to return Elian to Juan Miguel
Gonzalez without a formal hearing on Elian's request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the INS have said only the boy's
father can speak for him, stressing that common sense dictates that
a 6-year-old cannot understand the complex issue of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court in Miami seemed critical of how both
agencies have treated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it appear that plaintiff might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so,'' wrote the
panel, referring to a request for asylum signed by Elian.
``According to the record, plaintiff, although a young child, has
expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes. It is not clear that the
INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the only proper
representative, considered all of the relevant factors,
particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel went on to write that, under the Immigration Service's
own guidelines, a minor can, under some circumstances, apply for
asylum even against ``the express wishes of his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said the ruling allows the Miami family to continue to
turn the boy against his father in what he has referred to as
brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government does not act immediately to remove Elian
from the care of Lazaro Gonzalez and return him to his father, it
will bear responsibility for the harm that continues to be
inflicted on Juan Miguel's beloved son,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has Elian remained in the custody and control of his
Miami relatives, his situation has deteriorated,'' said Craig. Last
week, family members in Miami videotaped Elian in what appeared to
be a coached message to his father, in which the boy said he wanted
to remain in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was another setback for the federal government in a
case that saw the attorney general travel to Miami to try to work
out a deal to reunite the father and son.
</P>
<P>
   That trip that ended with Lazaro Gonzalez saying that if federal
officials wanted the boy, the would have to come into his home _
passing through a circle of hundreds and sometimes thousands of
determined demonstrators _ and take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the legal right to remove him, but politically
speaking, it puts his removal very much in question,'' said Pamela
Falk, a professor of international law at the City University of
New York who has argued cases similar to Elian's.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other political experts said the ruling may also
bode well for the family's full appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision scolds the INS for not considering Elian's
interest, and scolds them for not ever speaking to Elian,'' she
said. ``This decision gives a great boost to the possibility of the
success of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the family wins the appeal, it only means that the
boy's asylum request returns to Immigration, and Reno is,
ultimately, in charge of that agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the boy just goes back to Reno,'' Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the fight in Miami goes on to keep the child in the
house and away from a father that many people here see as an agent,
or a puppet, of the Fidel Castro government.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the family seemed hopeful that they, and an army of
Cuban Americans, could keep the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted,'' said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for the
Miami relatives. ``Had the boy been taken out of the country and we
had won the appeal, what would we have won?''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, said Garcia-Pedrosa, would never have come back from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the house on Northwest Second Street, demonstrators let down
their vigil long enough to joyously celebrate one more victory over
the U. S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a small step, but it is in the right
direction,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has led the demonstration
outside the house since the standoff began five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted ``Fidel, crazy man, you have little time
left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is working,'' said Miguel Saavedra, president of
Vigilia Mambisa, an exile group in Miami. He uncorked a bottle of
champagne, soaking several people. ``Justice in the U.S. is
working. Everyone is so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Miami is happy. Overhead, a plane droned by
trailing a banner that said ``SEND ELIAN HOME _ The Taxpayers.''
The banner was apparently in reference to the millions of dollars
the standoff, and the demand for added police and other municipal
services, is costing Miami and Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   And, one reporter was stabbed with a ball-point pen by an
agitated demonstrator.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing seemed to dampen the mood among Cuban Americans
here, who see the return of Elian to Cuba as a victory for Castro.
They either discount or ignore the wishes of relatives there for
the boy's return, and view their pleas for his return as communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a little kid,'' said James B. Exposito, 16, a
freshman at Miami High School. ``Over there he doesn't have
nothing. He won't have the love of his family there. They take care
of him here. Everybody will take care of him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the home, a non-Cuban vendor from New York sold T-shirts
with the words ``Elian Lives in America Now'' for $10, or two for
$15.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade mayor, Alex Penelas, who drew criticism from
around the country last month when he openly sided with
demonstrators and said he would not use the county's police to
assist in removing Elian from the home, encouraged the
demonstrators to rally around the house, but ``to do so in a
peaceful manner and not infringe on the rights of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health experts have said that the crowds and noise
and tension that surround the house are harming the boy, who plays
in the yard under the glare of strobe lights. Juan Miguel Gonzalez
has said the Miami relatives are emotionally abusing his son by
filling his head with lies.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowds say they simply cannot let him go, and that this
fight is, even five months old, really just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this ruling, we think it is plain that this is
in fact a very serious appeal,'' said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for
the family. ``And at the same time, no one should make predictions
on the ultimate outcome based on this order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, who has chain-smoked in his yard until the
early morning, keeping his own vigil, walked late Wednesday
afternoon to a neighborhood store. He bought a carton of Marlboros,
and went home to Miami's seemingly never-ending story.

 &HT;    It's hard to make boycotts stick, experts say
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's relatively easy to call for a boycott, but
another matter to do it successfully, say experts who follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger and better known the organization calling for a
boycott, the more likely it's going to receive attention in the
news media and among consumers at large,'' said Monroe Friedman, an
expert on consumer protest activity and author of a book on
boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman was reacting Wednesday to calls for a national boycott
of Coca-Cola products by a group of former and current
African-American employees. The group is headed by former Coca-Cola
human resources manager Larry Jones, a 15-year employee who was
laid off as part of a massive downsizing. The group wants Coca-Cola
to settle a racial discrimination suit quickly and improve its
treatment of black employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relatively easy to call for a boycott, but it's quite
another thing to mount an effective campaign that will endure over
a substantial time period,'' said Friedman, a professor at Eastern
Michigan University. He said organizers would have to access funds,
staffing and organizational skills to keep the momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said one factor working against Jones and the others
was the lack of initial support by major civil rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Holmes, director of the Southern Center for Studies in
Public Policy at Clark Atlanta University, said calls for a boycott
against Coca-Cola may be a bit premature.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who acknowledged he was a Coca-Cola investor, suggested
that calling for a boycott against Coca-Cola was not the same as
calling one to bring down the Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ``the timing of it,'' Holmes said. ``You're basically
innocent until proven guilty. I think they need to let the courts
decide first or see if the company agrees to a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he might support a boycott if talks to settle the
lawsuit failed or if Coca-Cola decided to appeal a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Putnam, former publisher of The National Boycott News in
Seattle, said companies fear boycotts because of the hit they can
take to the bottom line, as well as the blow to their image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some boycotts can have long-term implications,'' Putnam said.
``They (companies) might think it's better to settle now and move
on. ``
</P>
<P>
   The threat to Coca-Cola's image is a major concern to observers
inside and outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly is not a positive for the company in terms of
image,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe the company will very quickly resolve the
underlying situation so it will not have a lasting or significant
impact.''

GEORGE E. TAYLOR, 94, PIONEER IN CHINA STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor George E. Taylor, a historian and political scientist
who specialized in Asia, died April 14 at his home in Seattle. He
was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ``was one of the founders of modern China studies in the
United States,'' said Andrew J. Nathan, a professor of political
science at Columbia and a specialist in China.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor retired in 1975 from the University of Washington, in
Seattle, after having been chairman, from 1939 to 1969, of its
department of Russian and Far Eastern studies and of what became
the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies. He took time
out in World War II to work with the Office of War Information,
where he became deputy director of the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was a professor of Far Eastern history and
politics and then of Asian studies at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was born in Coventry, England, and left for the United
States in 1928. After studying at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, Taylor
taught in China in the '30s and won praise with a book, ``America
in the New Pacific,'' that was published not long after Pearl
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, William Henry
Chamberlin, an author and a historian, wrote that Taylor, thanks to
``his cosmopolitan background,'' had ``an ability to view the
pattern of Far Eastern power politics realistically, and with a
noteworthy absence of nationalist bias.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor had a strong dislike of what he saw as Japanese
methods of imperialism. He wrote in the book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese in China fill every position from the highest offices
of state to those of peddlers of knicknacks, taxi drivers, railway
clerks, sellers of opium and managers of houses of prostitution.
They do not rule, they occupy, they do not tax, they expropriate;
they do not compromise, they terrorize; they do not respect native
culture, they ram their own mystical rubbish down the throats of
people far more civilized than themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review, Chamberlin wrote prophetically, `` Taylor is
probably correct in believing that the future of Asia will be
dominated either by a ruthless, streamlined Japanese imperialism,
administering the opiate of old reactionary oriental philosophies
to its subjugated peoples, or by the American conception of proper
relations between East and West with much more freedom and quality
and self-government for the Eastern peoples than they could enjoy
under an imperialist regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Jackson School, Jere Bacharach, recalled
that Taylor had a strong commitment ``to the understanding of
societies through an analysis of their cultural values.'' In the
'40s, he set up an interdisciplinary group of social scientists to
study Japanese value systems.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Seattle in 1947, Taylor contended that the decision to
drop the atomic bombs on Japan had not been based on all the
available evidence. ``It is essential for the future,'' he said,
``that the skills of social scientists be used in the formulation
of key decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   On that occasion, he also endorsed a statement by Dr. Alexander
H. Leighton, another former executive at the Office of War
Information, that it had not been necessary to drop the atomic
bombs because social scientists had already predicted that Japan
would fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar years, Taylor brought together highly regarded
scholars from China at the University of Washington and founded a
strong Chinese studies program. He conducted similar ground work in
Russian studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s and '60s, Nathan said, ``the field of China studies
was torn with ideological divisions between the people who were
very strongly anti-communist and others who urged a more
sympathetic understanding of communism in China.'' Taylor was in
the former group, Nathan said, ``and it's said that he always
conducted himself with courtesy and and kept those disputes at a
level of scholarly discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the author, the co-author or the editor of more than 12
books.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor he received a bachelor and master's from the University
of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   He married Roberta Stevens White in 1933. She died in 1967. He
married Florence R. Kluckhohn in 1968. She also died.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his last wife, Margaret Perthou Taylor; two
brothers, Harold and Reginald, both of England; three children,
Claire, of California; Gordon, of Portland, Ore.; and Robin
Daugherty, of Colorado; 10 grandchildren; and 11
great-grandchildren.

DESPITE EARNINGS DROP, BOEING EXECS UPBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Wall Street Wednesday rewarded The Boeing Co.'s
recovery from last month's strike _ despite a decline in earnings _
with the biggest one-day gain in its stock price in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing came through the 40-day strike by its engineers in good
shape and should be able to get its backlog of airplanes delivered
by the end of the second quarter, company executives said reporting
first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although earnings fell 11 percent as a result of the strike, the
company easily beat reduced Wall Street estimates, and executives
painted an upbeat picture of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, our work force is back together as a team, we are
executing our recovery plan and operating margins are continuing to
improve,'' Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said during a teleconference
with industry analysts and media.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted by sending Boeing's stock up $2.50 a share
to close at $37.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this strike had happened two years ago, it would have been
a complete disaster for the company,'' said analyst Bill Fiala of
Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Boeing's production system was in chaos and its stock
price and and earnings were falling like rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could not have come through this as healthy as they
have,'' Fiala said. ``For them to maintain respectable profit
margins with a $2.5 billion shortfall is phenomenal. Their
operations are in much better shape than they were two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That $2.5 billion figure was how much Boeing lost in commercial
revenue in the quarter because of delayed airplane deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Wood, aerospace analyst and vice president with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, upgraded Boeing's stock to a ``strong buy''
after Wednesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just warming up,'' Wood said of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Boeing had total revenues of $9.91
billion, down 31 percent from the same period in 1999. Net income
was $418 million, or 11 percent less than a year earlier. That
translated to earnings of 48 cents a share, down from 50 cents a
share in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding special items, Boeing earned 41 cents per share for
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had estimated
profits at 35 cents a share, down from a consensus forecast of 56
cents before the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace began a strike on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the work disruptions caused by the strike, it was
a very respectable quarter,'' said analyst Peter Jacobs of
Seattle's Regan MacKenzie Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the outlook for 2001 is firming up nicely,''
Jacobs said. ``Management believes revenue will be up slightly but
earnings should be up handsomely.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said total revenue this year will be $50 billion, and
projected revenues of $51 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said the company expects only ``modest'' revenue growth
over the next three years, but profitability will continue to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Heading in to Wednesday's earning's announcement, analysts were
not overly concerned about the expected drop in revenue due to the
strike. They were mainly focused on Boeing being able to make its
all-important airplane delivery commitments for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had said it would deliver 490 planes in 2000
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strike, Boeing delivered 75 jetliners in the
first quarter _ 50 fewer than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we will essentially be back on our original delivery
plan by the end of the second quarter,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   That means Boeing will need to deliver around 180 planes this
quarter, analysts said. As of Tuesday night, Boeing had delivered
102 jets since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The strike mainly disrupted the company's commercial operations,
which had revenues of $5.17 billion in the first quarter, compared
with $9.8 billion a year earlier _ a 47 percent drop. Boeing was
producing many more planes in 1999, when it delivered a record 620.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, the commercial group had net income of $259
million, down 35 percent from the $396 million in the first quarter
of 1999. Commercial profit margins were 5 percent for the quarter,
an improvement over the 4 percent margins a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial margins fell from the fourth quarter, when they
peaked at 7 percent. That was primarily due to the delayed
deliveries and some cost impacts associated with the strike, Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Debby Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said the
commercial side of the business continues to see significant
productivity gains, especially in the 737 and 777 programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lean manufacturing efforts are really starting to bear some
fruit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing performed well across its three main business units _
commercial airplanes, space and communications, and military
aircraft and missiles, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's military aircraft and missiles unit had earnings of
$298 million on revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter. Revenue
was flat from a year earlier. Profit margins increased slightly to
10.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Space and communications, which executives have said will
eventually become the company's fastest growing segment, had
earnings of $60 million on revenue of $1.66 billion. A year ago,
the unit had earnings of $61 million on revenue of $1.54 billion
</P>
<P>
   Operating margins for the space and communications unit in the
first quarter were 3.6 percent, down slightly from a year ago.
Hopkins said research and development spending, much of it for the
Delta 4 rocket program, kept margins down.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's total research and development spending for the quarter
was $288 million, down from $361 million for the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks the low point for our R&AMP;D spending as a company,''
Hopkins said. This year, Boeing will spend about $1.5 billion in
research and development, up about $100 million from last year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Boeing delivered its fourth quarter 1999 earnings report in
January, analysts expressed concern about a sharp drop in research
and development spending.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said research and development is ``a key component of
what we are as a company. We see the value of it increasing as we
look over the next few years at some of the exciting programs we
are working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Boeing's engineers have complained the company has cut
back on research and development to boost profits, a charge the
company denies.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said Boeing is paying ``direct attention to its future by
long term research and development.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company needs to do a better job of sharing its
vision of the future with its work force, especially in the
aftermath of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``major'' meeting with the SPEEA union will be
tonight, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important information and building effort for the
long term,'' Condit said. `` ... People want to know what their
role is ... how do they fit in ... We are going to have a lot of
very exciting engineering to do ... but you have to paint that
picture. ... with a lot of face to face communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can send out so many little letters, but in the end people
want to understand and get a good strong gut feeling.''

PUTIN WINS ANOTHER VICTORY IN PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to CORRECT Mabatex to MABETEX in 1st graf of optional

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Last week, President-elect Vladimir Putin pushed the
long overdue ratification of a major arms control treaty through a
compliant lower house of parliament. Wednesday he scored a victory
with Russia's regional bosses in the parliament's upper chamber,
easily winning a vote to get rid of a prosecutor who was the
scourge of former President Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, the upper house also approved the START II
nuclear arms pact, which passed the lower house last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid display of loyalty from the governors and local
leaders in the Federation Council, as the upper house is called,
was their 133-10 vote to dismiss Yuri Skuratov, the general
prosecutor whom Yeltsin tried twice to fire last year after he
began to investigate corruption in the Kremlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia now has a real, solid president and it needs a
full-blooded working prosecutor,'' said Anatoly Lisitsyn, governor
of the Yaroslavl region northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier votes on Skuratov, the upper house voted against
the Kremlin, displaying a rare rebellious streak that was a
reflection of Yeltsin's growing political weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three weeks after his election on March 26, Putin has
scored back-to-back parliamentary victories, proof that he has the
political strength to command a majority in both houses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what Putin plans to do with his mandate.
Both the ratification of START II and the dismissal of Skuratov are
leftovers from the Yeltsin agenda.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to dismiss Skuratov was made in February 1999,
shortly after he started working with prosecutors in Switzerland on
a corruption and kickback investigation that linked the Kremlin's
property management office and Mabetex, a Swiss-based firm that did
extensive business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation was used by Yeltsin's opponents to challenge
his authority in the upper house, which under the Russian
constitution must approve any changes in the office of the general
prosecutor, a position similar to that of the U.S. attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Backed into a corner, the Kremlin shifted the focus onto
Skuratov himself, with the broadcast on a state-run television
channel of a videotape showing the prosecutor in bed with two
prostitutes. Despite the humiliation and a subsequent investigation
into his own conduct, Skuratov continued to battle for his old job,
even after he was formally suspended.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Skuratov lost his fight and acknowledged that the
new political situation in Russia ``objectively requires my
departure.'' He said the future of his investigations would depend
on ``the position of the Federation Council and the president of
the country, and if the president does nothing, then all these
cases will disappear into the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin has done little to reveal his plans for Russia,
including how he wants to carry out what he called in his campaign
``a dictatorship of the law.'' In the three weeks since his
election he has continued to project the image of the resolute,
energetic leader, which was enhanced this week with a three-day
foreign tour that took him from Belarus to Britain and then on
Tuesday to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   His first major policy statement is expected soon after his May
7 inauguration, when he will address both houses of parliament with
a state of the nation speech. A more detailed program, now being
prepared by a privately funded think-tank headed by German O. Gref,
is expected to be issued later next month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the meantime, Putin seems to prefer to keep people guessing
about his plans and policies, from the redefinition of the
relationship between the central government and the regions to the
rearrangement of broadcasting licenses among competing media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in meetings with foreign businessmen, has repeatedly
stressed his commitment to the principles of a market economy. His
naming last week of Andrei Illarianov, a liberal economist, as his
chief economic adviser was seen as support for continued economic
reform in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economy, helped by high oil prices, has performed
better than expected a year ago, but Putin has reportedly called
for a tight budget for next year, to prepare for the possibility of
lower energy prices.

CANADA ARRESTS 15-YEAR-OLD IN INTERNET ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: Quote in last line of 9th graf is cq. It is as written.) 
By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian law enforcement officials said Wednesday that they had
arrested a Montreal high school student in one of the computer
attacks that crippled some of the Internet's biggest sites in
February, exposing deep vulnerabilities in the fledgling world of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old suspect, whom the authorities identified only by
the online nickname Mafiaboy, was accused of conducting an attack
against Cable News Network's Web site. He is the first to face
charges in the onslaught that hindered access to the World Wide Web
sites of Yahoo, eBay and ETrade, among others, and forced hundreds
of other big-name sites to shore up their defenses against an
invisible and far-flung threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian suspect was not charged in those other attacks,
however, and authorities in Canada and the United States said their
investigations were continuing. Some computer security experts
reiterated their belief Wednesday that the attacks had several
authors acting independently.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal youth was charged with two counts of criminal
mischief for an attack on Feb. 8 against CNN.com, which said it was
``seriously affected'' for two hours. As a minor, he faces up to
two years of detention if convicted and a fine of $1,000. U.S.
officials said they were studying whether charges might also be
brought in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot close the door to further arrests and further
charges,'' said Inspector Yves Roussel of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, adding that such cases were not easy to investigate
because they involved ``a crime without borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``denial of service'' attacks, the assaults entail
bombarding a Web site's computers with streams of meaningless data,
making it impossible for the computers to respond to legitimate
users. The attackers hijack dozens if not hundreds of computers
throughout the Internet, and enlist their assistance in the attack
by programming them to send the streams of data.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a crucial piece of evidence may have come from computer
network administrators at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. In the hours after the attack against CNN.com, Kevin
Schmidt, campus network programmer at the university, noticed that
a desktop computer in a physics research lab had been used to send
``thousands of requests per minute'' at the CNN Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said that several days later the university voluntarily
gave the computer's hard drive to the FBI. Schmidt said the hard
drive included ``trace information'' suggesting that the attacker
lacked sophistication, and that the attack might have originated in
Canada. ``The compromise was kind of sloppy, and information was
left behind on the machine itself,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials also received assistance from computer
security experts in Palo Alto, Calif., who tracked statements made
in Internet chat rooms by someone using the nickname Mafiaboy. In
an exchange on Feb. 11 on an Internet chat forum, a participant
calling himself Mafiaboy is asked, ``You're not in jail yet?'' and
responds, ``No one evens knows I did it fer shure.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel de la Garza, a computer security expert at Securify in Palo
Alto, who turned over the Internet chat logs to the FBI, said he
had been monitoring the activity of Mafiaboy for three months
before the attacks. He said someone calling himself Mafiaboy had
come to his attention as a member of a ``cybergang'' called TNT,
whose members were breaking into systems around the Internet, in
some cases to steal credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a history of compromising a large number of machines,''
de la Garza said. But he said his analysis of the chat logs and of
a Stanford University computer used as a relay in an attack against
eBay suggested that Mafiaboy was not the only source of the
February attacks. ``There should be more arrests,'' de la Garza
added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, computer security experts continue to debate whether the
attacks appear to be the work of one or more people. Those who
assert that copycats were at work said the methods of attacks
differed in key respects, and they say Mafiaboy was not the only
person claiming credit in chat rooms. Those who believe the
assaults were the work of one person or group say copycats could
not have compromised enough computers to set an attack in process
so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have taken a lot of preparation to mount the kind of
attack they did,'' said Charles Palmer, manager of network security
and cryptography for IBM Research.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And despite the widespread attention, it has been difficult to
assess the actual damage from the attacks, starting on Feb. 7
against Yahoo. The sites themselves have minimized the problems;
CNN.com, for instance, did not lose significant advertising revenue
during the attack and was never completely shut down, said Edna
Johnson, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some market research firms have put the total
cost of the attacks in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
suggesting to computer security experts that companies either do
not know the cost or want to avoid alarming investors.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the attacks drew attention from the highest
levels of government, with legislators suggesting that e-commerce
could not thrive unless better protected.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno praised the
``extraordinary cooperation'' between U.S. and Canadian authorities
in the case. ``I believe this recent breakthrough demonstrates our
capacity to track those who would abuse this remarkable new
technology and track them down wherever they may be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal suspect was arraigned in youth court on Monday,
then released under strict conditions. He is prohibited from using
a computer except at school, and then only for academic purposes
with supervision. He may not connect to the Internet or go to any
establishment that sells Internet access or rents or sells
computers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested at his home on Saturday, officers of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police seized his computers and
computer-related material, which they are subjecting to analysis,
Roussel said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mafiaboy was caught because he was unsophisticated and
left traces of evidence. ``They want to show they're good at it and
compete to be the best,'' the inspector said of competition among
hackers. ``Except Mafiaboy wasn't the best. He was not what we
would call a genius in that field.''

<P>
   Alice Sheets Marriott, matriarch of the tight-knit family whose
name stands on thousands of hotels worldwide, died on Monday in
Washington. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1927 with a single root beer stand, Marriott and
her husband, J. Willard Marriott Sr., built one of the world's
leading hospitality companies. Today, Marriott International, which
is still run by the Marriott family, has more than 140,000 workers
and annual sales approaching $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Marriott also raised a family that now numbers
two children, eight grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. She
``personified the American dream,'' Marriott International said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Sheets was born in Salt Lake City, on Oct. 19, 1907. In
June 1927, while still a teen-ager, she graduated with honors from
the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Spanish. Two
days later, she married Marriott, another University of Utah
graduate, and the couple set off in a Model T Ford to Washington,
where Marriott had just opened a root beer stand. There she worked
as the shop's bookkeeper, taking its hard-earned nickels to the
bank each day.
</P>
<P>
   As summer turned to fall, root beer sales slipped, leaving the
Marriotts anxious to expand their menu. Marriott spoke to the chef
of the Mexican Embassy to learn the recipes for tamales and chili
con carne. The Marriotts practiced the dishes in their apartment
for two days, then added them to the menu at the stand, which they
renamed The Hot Shoppe. The spicy dishes were a hit, and the
Marriotts quickly opened more Hot Shoppes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost from the start, my parents _ especially my father _
launched the process of figuring out how to do something right and
then writing it down. From washing windows to burnishing silverware
to arranging buffet tables and processing customers' checks, no
aspect of the workplace went untouched,'' J.W. Marriott Jr., wrote
in his 1997 memoir, ``The Spirit to Serve: Marriott's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   A devotion to detail served the Marriotts well, as the chain
thrived, eventually expanding to 65 sites. The Marriott family was
also growing _ J.W. Jr. was born in 1932, and Richard followed in
1939.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1957, the Marriotts moved into the hotel business,
which was taking off in tandem with the interstate highways.
Marriott spent much of the night before the opening of the first
Marriott hotel, the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Arlington, Va.,
helping hang pictures in each of its 365 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   By offering travelers a consistent, dependable and safe night's
rest, the Marriott chain quickly surpassed more established
competitors. Today, many hotel operators consider Marriott the
world's top hotel company, with a reputation for treating employees
and customers fairly.
</P>
<P>
   As Marriott grew, Marriott spent more time on charity work in
the Washington area, including serving two 10-year terms on the
board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. A
conservative Republican, she was vice chairman of the Republican
National Committee from 1965 to 1976, and honorary chairman of the
1973 Nixon inaugural committee. &QL;

RUSSIAN WITH ALLEGED MOB TIES GETS VISA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A member of the Russian Parliament who had been
repeatedly denied visas to enter the United States because of
alleged ties to organized crime was granted approval by the State
Department last week to attend a program at Harvard University's
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Kobzon is one of 24 Parliament members who arrived in
Cambridge to attend a two-week program run by the Kennedy School to
instruct them on American government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Kobzon could not be reached for comment but, according to the
faculty director of the program, Kobzon intends to drop out of the
program Thursday and return to Moscow. Kobzon gave no reason for
leaving early, said David C. King, a professor at the Kennedy
School and the program's faculty director.
</P>
<P>
   King said he was unaware of Kobzon's background until questioned
by the Globe about Kobzon's participation in the program. King said
Harvard played no role in seeking the visas for Kobzon and other
Parliament members, and that the request had been made by the
Russian government to the US Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, who asked not to be identified,
said late Wednesday that as a member of the Duma, or lower house of
Parliament, Kobzon would have been afforded special consideration
for a visa this time since he was requesting it as an official
member of the Russian government and it was to allow him to
participate in a formal educational program.
</P>
<P>
   A popular singer by profession and known as the Frank Sinatra of
Russia, Kobzon is a close political ally of Moscow mayor Yuri
Luzhkov. A ``60 Minutes'' program on Luzhkov in October 1998
reported that the CIA identified Kobzon as the czar of the Russian
mafia and said that members of the Yeltsin government had urged
Luzhkov to distance himself from Kobzon.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the State Department had denied a visa for
at least the prior three years on grounds he might engage in
criminal activity in the United States. US law enforcement sources
called Kobzon an ``intermediary'' for organized crime groups in
Russia, according to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobzon denied any such links to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   While King called Kobzon an ``exemplary'' participant in the
Kennedy School program, Marshall Goldman of Harvard's Davis Center
for Russian Studies said it was ``embarrassing'' to have Kobzon
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known in Russia that he has been denied visas
because of his background,'' Goldman said. ``He shouldn't be here
just because he is a Duma member.''

ADVERTISING: GREY'S CHIEF BEGINS TO ADDRESS SUCCESSION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Madison Avenue has wondered when Edward H.
Meyer, the supreme commander of Grey Advertising in New York, would
relinquish some of his power and authority.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, president and chief executive, Meyer has long
declined to designate an heir apparent or delegate some of his
duties, eliciting comparisons to dominant executives in other
industries like Henry Ford and William S. Paley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriarch Ed Meyer's failure to make known a clear succession
plan has left his agency, an industry institution, with an
indistinct and murky future,'' the trade publication Advertising
Age said in an unusual editorial that led the Viewpoint page of
last week's issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Meyer, 73, is finally making the first steps toward
outlining the future of Grey, which has estimated billings of more
than $8 billion from clients like British American Tobacco, Mars,
Oracle, Procter &AMP; Gamble and SmithKline Beecham. But those who
emulate Regis Philbin and seek a final answer to the succession
issue will have to wait because, he said, ``the next obvious step
is a year away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reorganization described Wednesday to Grey employees, Meyer
will become the chairman and chief executive of a new holding
company, Grey Global Group, which will be formed subject to
shareholder approval _ considered probable because Meyer owns about
70 percent of Grey's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior managers will join Meyer in stepping up from the
core advertising agency operation, to be renamed Grey Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good news for Grey,'' said Meyer, ``and it's very
good news for me because I don't want to work so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking out some of the older, wiser souls from the
advertising business,'' he added, ``to help grow our other exciting
lines of businesses.'' Those graybeards _ or Greybeards, if you
will _ include Robert L. Berenson, 60, president for North American
operations at Grey Advertising, who will be vice chairman and
general manager at Grey Global, and Steven G. Felsher, 50,
executive vice president for finance at Grey Advertising, who will
be vice chairman and chief financial officer at Grey Global.
</P>
<P>
   The other business lines apart from Grey Worldwide that will
report to Grey Global include Beyond Interactive and Grey
Interactive, specializing in Internet marketing; GCI, public
relations; Grey Direct, direct marketing; and Mediacom, media
services.
</P>
<P>
   While each of those operations is to be run by a chairman,
president, chief executive or managing director, or a combination
of those, no one at Grey Worldwide _ representing 60 percent of the
total revenue of the new Grey Global _ will have titles that broad.
The most senior titles at Grey Worldwide will be geographic, for
regions or offices. The worldwide account directors at Grey
Worldwide, who handle important clients including Mars and P&AMP;G,
will report directly to Meyer and other executives at Grey Global.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is get a new management team'' at Grey
Worldwide, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``North America comes next, in a very short period of
time, and then we'll go from there. In a year, there'll be a
chairman and a president of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two executives seemed poised for promotion at Grey Worldwide.
One is Steven Blamer, who turned 44 yesterday; he is leaving
London, where he had been chief executive at Grey Advertising, to
become president for New York at Grey Worldwide. The other is
Carolyn Carter, 44, executive vice president and global account
director on the Mars account at Grey Advertising. She will become
president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Grey Worldwide,
based in London and New York, while continuing her Mars account
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving Steve the largest agency in the system, New York,
and saying `Go run it,''' Meyer said. ``He will do that and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolyn is also of the right generation and age'' to be an
heir apparent, he added.
</P>
<P>
   There will be two other regional managers for Grey Worldwide.
One is Bernd Michael, 54, chairman and chief executive for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, based in Dusseldorf, Germany, and
London; he had been deputy chairman for Europe and chief executive
for Germany at Grey Advertising. The other is Eric Rosenkranz, 47,
president for the Asian-Pacific region, based in Hong Kong; he had
been executive vice president and regional director for Latin
America at Grey Advertising. A president for Latin America at Grey
Worldwide is to be named soon.
</P>
<P>
   On the creative side of Grey Worldwide, just as on the account
management side, there is to be no top executive. Stephen A.
Novick, 59, executive vice president for worldwide creative
services at Grey Advertising, will become vice chairman and chief
creative officer at Grey Global while still overseeing creative
output at the advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve will wear two hats as he and I form a partnership,''
Blamer said. ``Over time, we will look for who the obvious partner
should be for me, and Steve will have a role in that.''
</P>
<P>
   That partner could come from a cadre of creative managers at
Grey Worldwide. They include five executive vice presidents and
executive creative directors in New York: Rob Biaocco, Richard K.
Mahan, Mark A. Schwatka, Robert Skollar and David G. Tutin. Other
top creative executives at Grey Worldwide are Tim Mellors in
London, Alain Godefroid in Belgium, Rob Dow and Jeff Orr in the
Asian-Pacific region and Carlos Perez in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years, this is the plum job,'' Blamer said of his new
duties. ``The person who really appreciates this is my mother. She
called and said, `Steven' _ and she's the only one who calls me
Steven _ `this is a nice birthday present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Blamer was indicative of ``the dynamic, youthful
management'' that is to lead Grey Worldwide, adding: ``Since I have
been taunted so often about succession and my age, I want to point
out with great glee that the people coming in to run the
advertising agency are an average age of 46, 47.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the complaints that he dragged his feet in developing a
succession plan, Meyer said: ``I was the architect of this, the
sole architect of this. I was going as fast as my little feet would
carry me. I wish to put to rest all the questions: `Where's the
young blood?' `Where's the succession?'''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not ``Where's the beef?'' _ but there's a ring to
it.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other appointments in connection with the
reorganization. At Grey Global, Alec Gerster, 51, becomes media
ventures director while continuing as chairman at Mediacom, and
Neil I. Kreisberg, 55, becomes group executive vice president; he
will hold the same post at Grey Worldwide and will also be
executive managing director there, overseeing the P&AMP;G account.
</P>
<P>
   At Grey Worldwide, O. John C. Shannon, 62, was named president
for international, and these managers were named executive vice
presidents and executive managing directors: Joseph A. Celia, 40,
overseeing British American Tobacco; Jonathan E. Fox, 54; and Clive
Holland, 56, overseeing SmithKline Beecham from London.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola elevated Ingrid Saunders Jones, one of its
top African-American executives, to senior vice president and
promoted several other executives to vice president.
</P>
<P>

BOMBING MEMORIAL DEDICATION DRAWS THOUSANDS TO REMEMBER, AND DRAW
HOPE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Thousands of people filled the streets of
downtown Oklahoma City on Wednesday to dedicate a national memorial
for those who died _ and for those who survived _ the bombing of
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno attended the
dedication ceremonies and implored Oklahomans to think of the
memorial as a shrine of triumph, rather than a mark of tragedy,
triggered by the most treacherous act of terrorism on American
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is such sacred ground,'' Clinton said, speaking at
the site where the bomb took 168 lives, 19 of them children. ``We
may never have all the answers about what happened here,'' he said,
``but as we continue our journey towards understanding, one truth
is clear: What was meant to break, has made you stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The president called convicted bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry
Nichols ``cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, speakers marveled over how Oklahoma City
citizens have rebounded from the enormous blast, triggered from a
truck filled with and explosive mix of fuel and fertilizer, on the
morning of April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people of Oklahoma City, thank you for showing America
how to stand up to evil, an evil ... spawned from hell,'' Reno said
at the early evening ceremony. ``In the face of evil that would
stagger the soul, you demonstrated the triumph of the American
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a much smaller, but more emotional, memorial
ceremony was held primarily for bombing survivors, the relatives of
the dead and for the rescue workers who helped pull victims from
the mangled Murrah building.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Biddy said he had to force himself to attend, but did so
for his two young sons, who on a different day would have been
inside the ``America's Kids'' day care center when it was ripped to
pieces by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of enduring'' the memorial, said Biddy, who
lost his mother, Oleta Biddy, to the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're trying to live with and not dwell on,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the blast, survivors and victims'
families were able to walk where the Murrah building once stood. It
is now replaced by large bronze memorial walls, acting as ornate
gates to a reflection pool, and 168 granite-and-glass chairs, each
containing the name of a person killed by the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is beautiful,'' said Teresa Corall, who came from Akron
to pay tribute to her brother, Rick Tomlin, a Department of
Transportation worker who was killed on the fourth floor of the
Murrah building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask for a better memorial for my brother,'' Corall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Graves, who lost her daughter, Cassandra Booker, in the
bombing, said she was not quite as impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chair is real nice, but the Lord is who gives me
strength,'' Graves said, adding: ``It doesn't do any good for me to
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile from the anniversary and dedication ceremonies,
Nichols was in the Oklahoma County Jail, awaiting trial on state
murder charges in connection to the bombing. The state of Oklahoma
is seeking the death penalty for Nichols, who has already been
convicted in U.S. district court and sentenced to life in federal
prison.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh has been convicted on federal charges of murder and
conspiracy and was sentenced to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Out of breath after walking up a steep hill from the chair
commemorating her dead son, 78-year-old Clarissa Harding said she
does not know whether she is healthy enough to ever return. Harding
said she would like to, though, because the memorial ``makes you
realize you're not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, however, that she is uncomfortable that Nichols is
jailed so close to where her dead son, Ronald, is memorialized. ``I
don't want him hanging around here,'' Harding said.

CLINTON HELPS DEDICATE OKLAHOMA BOMBING MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA City _ Marking the fifth anniversary of the worst act
of domestic terrorism in US history, President Clinton called the
site of the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building ``sacred
ground,'' and said, ``America will never forget'' the tragedy that
happened there.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling here for the dedication of the Oklahoma City National
Memorial, Clinton paid tribute to the 168 people killed, including
19 children, and the 850 who were injured in the bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19,1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places in our national landscape so scarred by
freedom's sacrfice that they shape forever the soul of America _
Valley Forge, Gettysburg, Selma. This place is such sacred
ground,'' Clinton said, at a public dedication ceremony attended by
many survivors and family members of the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that five years has not been long enough for the
families and survivors to heal, he said, ``I know the last five
years have not been easy. I hope you can take some comfort in
knowing that _ just as I said five years ago _ America is still
with you, and that, with this memorial, you can know American will
never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   At the somber outdoor ceremony that took place under a hot
evening sun, Clinton kept his remarks brief, and relied on
Scripture and the writer Ralph Ellison, a native of Oklahoma City,
to help comfort the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who were
convicted in federal court in the attack, as ``cowards.'' McVeigh
has been sentenced to death; Nichols has been sentenced to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near a gate to the victims' memorial, Clinton said,
``Five years ago, the cowards who killed them made a choice _ a
choice to attack this building and the people in it, because they
wanted to strike a blow at America's heartland _ at the core of our
nation's being. This was an attack on all America, and every
American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years later, we are here because you made a choice: A
choice to choose hope and love over despair and hatred,'' he said.
``I know there are still days when the old anger wells up inside
you; still days when tears fill your eyes, when you think your
heart will surely break. On those days, I hope you can come here
and find solace in the memory of your loved ones, in the honor of
your fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton helped untie the ribbon to mark the opening of the $29
million memorial, which stands on 3.3 acres and the site of what
used to be the federal building. The memorial features 168 granite
and bronze chairs on a lighted glass block pedestal _ one for each
person killed. A black reflecting pool runs alongside the chairs
and on opposite ends of the pool are two 42-foot bronze and
concrete gates.
</P>
<P>
   One gate is marked 9:01 and the other 9:03, intended to
symbolize the lives that were lost at 9:02 a.m., the time the
bombing occurred. The memorial also includes a wall inscribed with
the names of the survivors of the bombing. Other plans for the
project include construction of museum and an international
institute for the study of non-violence and the prevention of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Before he spoke, Clinton toured the memorial with two women who
lost relatives in the bombing as well as some survivors and rescue
workers, offering them pats on the back and hands on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he knelt down and ran his hand over one of the
glass and granite chairs that symbolizes one of the children
killed. He picked up flowers that the wind had blown off a chair
and put them back, and he stepped to the edge of the reflecting
pool, and placed his hand in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never have all the answers for what happened here,''
Clinton said, in his remarks. ``But as we continue our journey
toward understanding, one truth is clear: what was meant to break
has made you stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who along with several other
administration officials joined Clinton at the dedication, told the
crowd, ``Thank you for showing us how to stand up to evil.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Department of Justice pledged to ``never stop in
its pursuit of peace, in its effort to stop violence, in its
determination to stop terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that as he left the White House to fly here for the
dedication he glanced over at the dogwood tree on the South Lawn
that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton had planted five years ago in
memory of the lives lost in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years later, that tree stands a little taller, its spring
flowers are a little fuller, its roots have dug in a little deeper.
But it's still a young tree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` Five years isn't a very long time for trees to grow, or for
wounds to heal and hearts to mend. But today, like your beautiful
dogwood tree on the White House lawn, Oklahoma City is blooming
again.''

ACCUSED PROSTITUTE KILLER DESCRIBED AS `AVERAGE JOE' AND FAMILY
MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Lee Yates Jr. seems the epitome of ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   He is balding and polite and hardly worth a second look on the
streets of Spokane. He was an ace pitcher back in his high school
days on Whidbey Island, Wash., but his ball-playing is now limited
to playing catch with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing that made the 47-year-old aluminum worker
and ex-soldier stand out was his ability to fly helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, soft-spoken and courteous, sat in a tiny courtroom in
Spokane as a judge ordered him held in jail unless he comes up with
$1.5 million cash bail. Prosecutors accuse him of killing a
16-year-old prostitute. And they believe he may be a serial killer
_ responsible for a string of prostitute slayings that have
obsessed Spokane police for years.
</P>
<P>
   From his South Hill neighborhood to his old home town on Whidbey
Island, the news stuck in the throats of those who knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Yates, he was a great guy. He really was,'' said Gary
Berner, an Oak Harbor, Wash., dentist.
</P>
<P>
   He and Yates graduated together from Oak Harbor High in 1970.
For a couple of summers, the pair worked long hours in Skagit
County vegetable fields to earn spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Yates pitched on the high school team and belonged to clubs open
to lettermen. As a junior, his fastball won him seven games in a
16-game season, said Harry Ferrier, who played on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of quiet,'' said Ferrier. ``He was kind of like
Joe Average.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the least likely guy I would think of if you mentioned
something like that,'' Berner said of the Spokane murders. ``He was
a solid, solid guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Oak Harbor kids were military brats. Their fathers
worked at the Navy air base in town. Berner was one, but he said
Yates apparently wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrier can still remember a sonnet Yates read aloud in sixth
grade. The teacher led the students to believe that Yates had found
it in a book. In fact, the youngster had written it.
</P>
<P>
   Yates' parents moved, and he ended up in Walla Walla. He
attended community college there and met Linda Brewer. The two
would later marry and have five children together.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time in the 1970s, he worked as a correctional
officer with his father-in-law, Bill Brewer, at the Washington
State Penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer told The Spokesman-Review of Spokane that his son-in-law
is ``a real loner'' who he never really got to know _ even after 24
years of marriage to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said Yates left his prison job one day and joined the
Army. Among his postings were Fort Drum in northern New York, where
the 10th Mountain Division is based. He was also at Fort Rucker,
the Alabama base where the Army's aviation branch is headquartered.
His Army tour also apparently included Desert Storm, the war to rid
Kuwait of Iraqi troops, and the peacekeeping mission to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   After close to 20 years in the military, however, Yates quit and
moved to Spokane in 1996. He failed to get a pilot's job there, The
Spokesman-Review reported.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in factory jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Givens, owner of Pantrol Inc., a Spokane firm that puts
together electronic instruments for heavy machinery, said Yates
worked at his business until 1997. He assembled components.
</P>
<P>
   Givens described Yates as a good worker who mostly kept to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really stuck out about him,'' Givens said. ``He was
just an average Joe _ pretty quiet. I didn't talk to him much. But
he seemed friendly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Givens said Yates was closer to his direct supervisor. The two
men sometimes spoke fondly to each other of their families. The
supervisor, who Givens declined to name, was so upset about Yates'
arrest Tuesday that he took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been quite a shock for all of us, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orders dried up at Pantrol in 1997. Givens had to to lay off
Yates and hasn't heard much from him since.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Yates turned to a Kaiser Aluminum smelter to
support his family. The regular workforce was on strike. Yates
hired on as a replacement worker, regularly crossing a picket line
to earn his pay.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Russell, president of the striking Local 329, said Yates
initially worked as a carbon setter _ intensive work that requires
respirator-equipped laborers to toil around pots of molton ore that
reach up to 1,700 degrees Farenheit. Sometime later, Russell said,
Yates' job changed to overhead crane operator in the pot room.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kaiser spokeswoman Susan Ashe: ``By all accounts he was a
good worker. He had a very good work record.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates maintained his military ties. He joined the National Guard
in April 1997, spending one weekend a month training with
helicopters at Fort Lewis south of Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to us very, very qualified. In the three years he was
assigned to us, he was a good performer. He did an excellent job,''
said Lt. Col. Rick Patterson, a National Guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was part of the 66th Aviation Brigade attached to Fort
Lewis. He trained other pilots, and federal records show he held
civilian licenses as a commercial and helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   His Spokane neighbors said they didn't know him well. There were
brief chats. He borrowed a tool or two.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed devoted to his four daughters and one son _ and to a
1977 white Corvette. It is the same Corvette from which
investigators took evidence that they believe ties Yates to
Jennifer Joseph's death.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who lived near the house Yates rented in 1996-97,
before buying the South Hill home, remember the ordinary-looking
man and his cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He washed his cars incessantly,'' said Judy Kauffman. ``He was
always out in the front driveway, changing the oil'' of the
Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman described Yates as ``cordial,'' but said other members
of his family kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very close neighborhood,'' she said. ``It's a
neighborhood where if you reach out, people will pull you in and
they didn't really reach out.''

RUSSIAN WITH ALLEGED MOB TIES GETS VISA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A member of the Russian Parliament who had been
repeatedly denied visas to enter the United States because of
alleged ties to organized crime was granted approval by the State
Department last week to attend a program at Harvard University's
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Kobzon is one of 24 Parliament members who arrived in
Cambridge to attend a two-week program run by the Kennedy School to
instruct them on American government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Kobzon could not be reached for comment but, according to the
faculty director of the program, Kobzon intends to drop out of the
program Thursday and return to Moscow. Kobzon gave no reason for
leaving early, said David C. King, a professor at the Kennedy
School and the program's faculty director.
</P>
<P>
   King said he was unaware of Kobzon's background until questioned
by the Globe about Kobzon's participation in the program. King said
Harvard played no role in seeking the visas for Kobzon and other
Parliament members, and that the request had been made by the
Russian government to the US Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, who asked not to be identified,
said late Wednesday that as a member of the Duma, or lower house of
Parliament, Kobzon would have been afforded special consideration
for a visa this time since he was requesting it as an official
member of the Russian government and it was to allow him to
participate in a formal educational program.
</P>
<P>
   A popular singer by profession and known as the Frank Sinatra of
Russia, Kobzon is a close political ally of Moscow mayor Yuri
Luzhkov. A ``60 Minutes'' program on Luzhkov in October 1998
reported that the CIA identified Kobzon as the czar of the Russian
mafia and said that members of the Yeltsin government had urged
Luzhkov to distance himself from Kobzon.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the State Department had denied a visa for
at least the prior three years on grounds he might engage in
criminal activity in the United States. US law enforcement sources
called Kobzon an ``intermediary'' for organized crime groups in
Russia, according to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobzon denied any such links to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   While King called Kobzon an ``exemplary'' participant in the
Kennedy School program, Marshall Goldman of Harvard's Davis Center
for Russian Studies said it was ``embarrassing'' to have Kobzon
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known in Russia that he has been denied visas
because of his background,'' Goldman said. ``He shouldn't be here
just because he is a Duma member.''

 PERSONALS: Shut Up and Read My Zipped Lips

<P>
   When  &UR; George W. Bush &LR;  became a member of Skull and Bones, the
Yale secret society to which his father had belonged, he was asked
to give himself a nickname, which is said to be that group's
custom. The Atlantic Monthly reports that he couldn't think of
anything, so they called him ``Temporary.'' They're still calling
him that.
</P>
<P>
   Magog, ``the nickname given to the incoming Bonesman deemed to
have the most sexual experience,'' was the name borne by George
W.'s pop, says the Monthly. But when a report regarding ``Magog''
appeared in the Washington Post, Skull and Bones members responded
by saying papa George's nickname was Barebones. The history,
therefore, is cloudy; further illumination would be welcome, if
Bonesmen dare blab.

   P.S. Hush-husher:  &UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; , who cited the First Amendment

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ State Sen. Mark A. MacDonald, a strapping beef
farmer and social studies teacher, knows he may have cost himself
his legislative job Wednesday when he voted with a majority of his
colleagues to approve marriage-like civil unions for gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had voted against civil unions, MacDonald said, how was he
going to explain it to his junior high students? ``That I voted the
way I did so I could get re-elected?'' he said. And ``to have the
voters think I was a good fellow and ignore all the testimony they
paid me to listen to?''
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking bill, which offers marriage benefits for gay
couples, gained final approval in the Vermont Senate on Wednesday
in a 19-11 vote. Two of the chamber's 13 Republicans joined all of
its 17 Democrats in passing the measure. It must now negotiate one
last hurdle next week in the House of Representatives, which
approved an almost identical bill last month, before it goes to
Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, for his promised signature. It would
then take effect this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure would be an American first. But it is all
the more striking in that so many Vermont lawmakers, like
MacDonald, a Democrat, have repeatedly voted in support of civil
unions despite indications from public opinion polls, phone calls,
letters and town meeting votes that they are bucking their
constituents' will and risking their seats in this fall's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see senators in tears _ they know this vote may well be
their last,'' said Sen. Peter Shumlin, the president pro tem, to
whom MacDonald gave an emotional, football-player hug after a
preliminary vote Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a vote that required more courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual seats and the slim Democratic majority in both
chambers are at stake, Shumlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked very hard to be in the majority,'' he said. ``I
recognize that today's action jeopardized that, and I know my
fellow senators recognize we jeopardize that. But there's a time
when you have to stand up for what you believe in, and this is
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing up, for some lawmakers, has required extra courage:
Several members of the House have reported recent vandalism to
their cars, which they believe is connected to their votes on civil
union. Some lawmakers say they have asked to give up their
legislators' license plates for regular ones because they are tired
of obscene gestures and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers have also described being appalled at the mail
and phone calls they have received from opponents of civil union,
who say that the legislators are working for the devil and will go
to hell and should forget about being re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Those lawmakers also take pains to say that such hostile
messages are few in number and that most of the gay marriage debate
has been conducted civilly.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases the threats appear to have backfired by
convincing lawmakers of the depth and breadth of anti-gay feeling
here, persuading them to vote for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said that hostile messages and phone calls made
them think: If this is what it is like for me, what have gays and
lesbians had to endure their whole lives?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Nancy I. Chard, a Democrat, said Wednesday that she had
complained about the nasty mail and calls to a colleague, a House
member who had come out of a cancer survivors support meeting to
find all her car windows smashed. Her friend's response, Chard
said, was that she was grateful for such messages ``because for
just a few minutes, when I read those letters, I'm able to honestly
walk in the shoes of another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Chard, asked Wednesday if she risked losing her seat with her
vote, said, ``All of us do, but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who oppose civil unions have received calls and
letters calling them bigots and homophobes, some say, even though
they are only trying to follow the will of their voters or their
own moral and religious convictions. But they do not worry aloud
about risking their seats.
</P>
<P>
   No public opinion poll run by a neutral organization has asked
specifically whether Vermonters support civil unions, but the vast
majority of towns that discussed the issue in meetings last month
opposed the idea, and past polls showed that a majority, although a
shrinking one, opposed gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, a Burlington Free Press poll found Vermonters about
equally divided over the state Supreme Court's decision in December
that same-sex couples deserved the same protections as heterosexual
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of civil unions _ like the Roman Catholic bishop of
Burlington, who called this ``a very sad day for the majority of
Vermonters'' _ have called repeatedly for a constitutional
amendment that would be voted on by the public, or at least a
nonbinding referendum to give the population a chance to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Richard W. Sears Jr., a Democrat and the chairman of
the judiciary committee, was asked whether he thought his vote in
favor of civil unions had placed his seat in jeopardy, he replied
instantly, ``Oh, yes, sure, no question about that.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS UNCERTAIN ABOUT NEXT STEP IN ELIAN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Okla.)  (With CUBA-BOY) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal appellate court ruling Wednesday
preventing the return to Cuba of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez caught
the Justice Department by surprise and left officials there
uncertain about how to proceed in the highly politicized case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the officials acknowledged was a setback, they said
they could still remove the child from the custody of his Miami
relatives and turn him over to his father. The ruling Wednesday
only blocks the child from leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno noted that the ruling, by a
three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, ``does not disagree with my determination'' that the boy
should be returned to his father, who is now in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not say that the boy cannot be reunited with his
father in this country,'' Reno said upon arriving in Oklahoma City
for a ceremony honoring those killed in the truck bombing there
five years ago Wednesday. ``In fact, the court said we need not
decide where or in whose custody the plaintiff should remain while
this appeal is pending.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Justice Department officials said
there was no immediate plan to remove the child forcibly from the
house in Miami, although they said discussions about such an action
would go forward in coming days. What has made those discussions so
difficult is the constant presence of dozens of demonstrators
outside the house where the boy has been living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still reviewing the court's decision, for I have just
had the chance to look at it as I have come off the plane,'' Reno
said. ``We are going to take and consider all our options and take
the course of action that we deem appropriate under the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Justice Department officials had seemed confident that the
appellate court would lift its temporary injunction, and the
panel's ruling to keep the order in place left officials there
appearing uncertain about how to proceed. Reno, too, seemed caught
off guard after she had unsuccessfully sought the peaceful transfer
of the child and ordered his transfer to federal custody, a
directive that Elian's Miami relatives refused to obey.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure has been mounting on Reno to end the impasse over the
child's custody, and the pressure may intensify now that the legal
debate over whether Elian's relatives have standing to apply for
his political asylum appears likely to go on for weeks. The Justice
Department can appeal any decision the circuit court ultimately
makes about that asylum question.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Reno noted on Wednesday, there are two issues involved
in the legal process. ``One,'' she said, ``is whether an asylum
application can be brought by distant relatives over the objection
of a father who is the sole surviving parent. The other issue is
who cares for the child while he is in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling ``addresses only the asylum issue, not the
care issue,'' she said, adding, ``The immigration laws clearly call
for a child to be placed in the care of a parent, in preference to
a more distant relative, while the child's immigration status is
being resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether she will move to retrieve the boy is uncertain,
given the atmosphere in the neighborhood where he has been living.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Reno said, ``No child
should be in that kind of never-never land for that long. Every day
that goes by in which Elian is not reunited with his father and
this matter brought to a conclusion can be disruptive'' for the
child.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Pressure should not be the issue. What is right
should be the issue.''

RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST CONVICTED OF GAS WELL BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Canada's most famous environmental radical,
Wiebo A. Ludwig, went to prison Wednesday after a judge here
convicted him of bombing a gas well in 1998 and encasing another
wellhead in concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in the heart of Canada's oil and gas country, the
provincial judge, Sterling Sanderman, also convicted Ludwig, a
former evangelical pastor, of three additional explosives-related
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The judge convicted Ludwig's close friend Richard Boonstra of
plugging the other gas wellhead in 1997. Boonstra was released on
bail. Sentencing for both men was set for next week.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-week trial captivated Canada as Ludwig, with his Old
Testament beard and 21st-century knack for television sound bites,
used the court proceedings to lambaste Alberta's oil and gas
industry for callousness toward the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ludwig's arrest culminated a wide investigation by
the Mounties of a rash of 160 acts of vandalism against the oil
industry in the forests and farmlands in northwestern Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig, now 58, moved from Ontario 15 years ago to set up a
religious farm commune in Hythe, about 250 miles northwest of here.
His three oldest sons married Boonstra's three daughters, and the
clan grew in size to 34 members.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1980s, during a boom in natural gas production,
a company won permission from the province, which owns most mineral
rights here, to drill gas wells in and around Ludwig's 316-acre
farm.
</P>
<P>
   The wells produced sour gas, a gas laced with hydrogen sulfide,
a neurotoxin that can be as deadly as cyanide. In the last 30
years, about 30 oil and gas workers in Alberta have been killed by
accidental exposure to the gas. In 1991, at Ludwig's Trickle Creek
farm, gas was leaked into the air, forcing a temporary evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s women in the clan suffered four miscarriages,
part of a wider cluster of health complaints, including memory loss
and eye and throat infections. With thousands of wells in the area
burning flares of excess gas into the night sky, Ludwig also blamed
pollution for his loss about 60 sheep and cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buried four children, we lost lots of animals _ how can you
not be concerned about the environment?'' Ludwig demanded during a
trial break in February.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest in January 1999, his oratory had become
increasingly violent. In the fall of 1998, after he had publicly
suggested that oil executives _ ``men in pinstripe suits'' _ be
made targets, a farmer near Calgary shot to death the vice
president of an oil company. Reminded of the comment at the
farmer's trial, Ludwig said, ``Inadvertently, I guess it was a
prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's stance attracted attention among North American
environmental radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, where oil and gas sustain the economy, what is now
called the ``Wiebo factor'' has helped to spur environmental
controls. Alberta's government has promised to phase out gas
flaring in two years. At the same time, Western Canadian provincial
governments are spending $7.5 million to study health impacts of
gas production. In the face of lawsuits and public opposition, oil
and gas companies now work more closely with farmers about the
placement of wells.
</P>
<P>
   But Ludwig has alienated many Canadians by his aura of violence.

A COURT WITH A CONSERVATIVE BENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ga., Ala.)  (With CUBAN-BOY)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled
Wednesday that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States
pending a political asylum claim on his behalf, defies easy
categorization, academics and lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was widely viewed as a liberal court that advanced a
civil rights agenda and, more recently, rose to the defense of
gays, the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, has in recent years
displayed a more conservative bent, notably in immigrant rights
cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 ruling, the court upheld President George Bush's order
to intercept Haitian refugees at sea and return them to their
homeland without the benefit of political asylum hearings. At the
time, the court held that only aliens who reached the United States
had the right to apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kurzban, a Miami immigration lawyer who has defended Haitian
refugees, said the appeals court ``generally is considered
pro-government on immigration cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, a conservative legal
watchdog group in Washington, said the court was ``by and large a
conservative circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges who ruled unanimously to keep Elian in the United
States represent a diverse group, each sent to the court by a
different president.
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Edmondson, a Reagan appointee and a former law professor,
is the longest-serving member of the three and a law-and-order
conservative who tends to side with prosecutors in capital cases.
In 1996 he upheld a state law mandating drug testing for office
seekers, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joel F. Dubina, a former district judge from Alabama who
was put on the appeals court by Bush, is perceived as more of a
centrist. He has weighed in on two prominent cases involving gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Dubina pleased gay activists by striking down a statute barring
public funds from going to a gay college group, but he pleased
their critics when he upheld a move by the state's attorney general
to withdraw a job offer to a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   The judge faced criticism in his confirmation process for his
reported membership in an all-white country club in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles R. Wilson, the only black member on the 12-member
court, was appointed by President Clinton last year. As a U.S.
attorney in Tampa, Fla., he handled a flood of drug-trafficking
cases, and was active in prosecuting health care fraud.

REPORTS CAUSE STOCK SLIDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disappointment with first-quarter reports from IBM and Intel
helped send stocks lower, ending the two-day surge after last
week's sell-off. The dot-com stocks that have fallen so sharply
recently were down again.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 87.16 points, or 2.3 percent, to
3,706.41, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 92.46
points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,674.96. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index was off 14.1 points, or nearly 1 percent, to
1,427.47.  &QL; 
APPLE TOPS PREDICTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer posted earnings that handily beat analysts'
estimates for its second quarter. In contrast to the slowing sales
for many PC makers, Apple reported strong demand across its product
lines. Apple reported its results after the close of the market.
Amid a broad decline on Nasdaq, its shares closed at $121.125, down
$5.75. After-hours, they traded as high as $125.5625.  &QL; 
TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened to a record $29.2 billion in
February from $27.4 billion during January, elevated by surging oil
prices and growing demand for imports, government figures showed.  &QL; 
CHRYSLER SALES UP
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler reported that sales climbed 17 percent in the
last three months, but it paid for that increase in the form of
lower profit margins on both Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz
automobiles. Net income rose 3 percent, to $1.62 billion, helped by
German tax reform. The results indicate that Daimler has yet to
overcome the unrelenting price competition in the American car
market.  &QL; 
LOWER-RISK CIGARETTE
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco said it would start promoting one of its
brands, Eclipse, as posing a potentially lower risk of cancer and
chronic bronchitis than traditional cigarettes, marking the first
time that a producer has made such advertising claims.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VISION FOR GREY
</P>
<P>
   Edward H. Meyer, 73, the chairman and chief executive of Grey
Advertising in New York, is making the first steps toward outlining
the future of the agency. In a reorganization described to Grey
employees, Meyer will become the head of a new holding company,
Grey Global Group. Based on the appointments at Grey Worldwide, the
new name for the core advertising agency, two executives seemed
poised for promotion. One is Steven Blamer, who will become
president for New York at Grey Worldwide. The other is Carolyn
Carter, who will become president for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa at Grey Worldwide.  &QL; 
CHASE MANHATTAN PROFIT GROWS
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan said its first-quarter profit rose 16 percent,
exceeding forecasts, as a surge in trading revenue and fees from
advising on mergers, plus gains on investments, lifted results.  &QL; 
AIRLINES POST RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   UAL and AMR, the parent companies of the world's two biggest
airlines, United and American, posted first-quarter results that
beat Wall Street expectations, while a strike threat hurt earnings
at US Airways, which posted a bigger-than-expected loss.  &QL; 
EARNINGS UP AT LUCENT
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, the world's leading phone-equipment maker,
said its second-quarter profit rose 41 percent, to 23 cents a
share, on higher sales of wireless and fiber-optic gear. The
company had warned in January that net income would be 21 to 23
cents a share when analysts were expecting 26 cents.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Champagne and exhilaration washed along the street in
Little Havana Wednesday, as a federal appeals court not only
extended an order that will keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the
United States until the court hears the full appeal of his case,
but strongly criticized the way government officials had handled
his request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Wednesday
barred anyone from taking Elian out of the country until the court
hears the child's case on May 11, and, in pointed language,
suggested that his Miami relatives' efforts to have his request for
asylum heard in court should not have been ignored. The ruling
ensures that questions of who rightfully speaks for the boy and
whether he is entitled to apply for asylum will be fully aired.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges wrote that they ``doubt that protecting a
party's day in court, when he has an appeal of arguable merit, is
contrary to the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in a legal sense, only a ruling on an emergency
injunction to keep the child in this country for a few more weeks,
but the judges' language seemed to chastise the government for its
claim that only the boy's father is legally entitled to speak for
him, and it lent credence to the Miami family's argument that the
small boy is a bona fide candidate for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to pray,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, who defied a federal order last week to give up the
boy and bring him to an airport for eventual reunification with his
Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Miami house, demonstrators celebrated with geysers of
champagne and quiet prayers over tightly clenched rosaries. ``It's
a victory for the Cuban people,'' said Francisca G. Espinosa, 68, a
retiree who lives on Miami Beach. It was unclear if she was
referring to Cubans on this side of the Florida Straits, the other
side or to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not answer a key question: who should have
custody of Elian while the legal process plays out. The Justice
Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have
insisted that Elian be reunited with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who is waiting for his child at a Cuban diplomat's house
outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Avoidance of that issue, Attorney General Janet Reno said, left
her the option of removing the boy from his uncle's home _ as she
has threatened to do for days. But Wednesday night, it remained
unclear whether she would take such a step, and officials inside
the department indicated they had been surprised by the court's
decision and were confused about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's order does not preclude me from placing Elian in
his father's care while he is in the United States,'' said Attorney
General Janet Reno, as she stepped off a plane in Oklahoma City,
where she had gone to attend a memorial service for victims of the
bombing of the federal building there five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five months after the boy was found floating on an inner
tube off the coast of Florida in a failed crossing from Cuba that
drowned his mother and 10 others, Elian remained encircled
Wednesday night by demonstrators at the house in Miami, many of
whom have said they will simply not allow the boy to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take and consider all our options and take the
course of action that we deem appropriate under the
circumstances,'' said Reno, leaving open the possibility that
federal officials might _ somehow _ still remove the boy from the
Miami house.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the reunion of father and son seemed assured. In
March, a U.S. district court judge in Miami upheld an Immigration
and Naturalization Service order to return Elian to Juan Miguel
Gonzalez without a formal hearing on Elian's request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the INS have said only the boy's
father can speak for him, stressing that common sense dictates that
a 6-year-old cannot understand the complex issue of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court in Atlanta seemed critical of how both
agencies have treated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it appear that plaintiff might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so,'' wrote the
panel, referring to a request for asylum signed by Elian.
``According to the record, plaintiff, although a young child, has
expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes. It is not clear that the
INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the only proper
representative, considered all of the relevant factors,
particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel went on to write that, under the Immigration Service's
own guidelines, a minor can, under some circumstances, apply for
asylum even against ``the express wishes of his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said the ruling allows the Miami family to continue to
turn the boy against his father in what he has referred to as
brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government does not act immediately to remove Elian
from the care of Lazaro Gonzalez and return him to his father, it
will bear responsibility for the harm that continues to be
inflicted on Juan Miguel's beloved son,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has Elian remained in the custody and control of his
Miami relatives, his situation has deteriorated,'' said Craig. Last
week, family members in Miami videotaped Elian in what appeared to
be a coached message to his father, in which the boy said he wanted
to remain in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was another setback for the federal government in a
case that saw the attorney general travel to Miami to try to work
out a deal to reunite the father and son.
</P>
<P>
   That trip that ended with Lazaro Gonzalez saying that if federal
officials wanted the boy, the would have to come into his home _
passing through a circle of hundreds and sometimes thousands of
determined demonstrators _ and take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the legal right to remove him, but politically
speaking, it puts his removal very much in question,'' said Pamela
Falk, a professor of international law at the City University of
New York who has argued cases similar to Elian's.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other political experts said the ruling may also
bode well for the family's full appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision scolds the INS for not considering Elian's
interest, and scolds them for not ever speaking to Elian,'' she
said. ``This decision gives a great boost to the possibility of the
success of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the family wins the appeal, it only means that the
boy's asylum request returns to Immigration, and Reno is,
ultimately, in charge of that agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the boy just goes back to Reno,'' Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the fight in Miami goes on to keep the child in the
house and away from a father that many people here see as an agent,
or a puppet, of the Fidel Castro government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the family seemed hopeful that they, and an army of
Cuban Americans, could keep the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted,'' said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for the
Miami relatives. ``Had the boy been taken out of the country and we
had won the appeal, what would we have won?''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, said Garcia-Pedrosa, would never have come back from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the house on Northwest Second Street, demonstrators let down
their vigil long enough to joyously celebrate one more victory over
the U. S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a small step, but it is in the right
direction,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has led the demonstration
outside the house since the standoff began five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted ``Fidel, crazy man, you have little time
left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is working,'' said Miguel Saavedra, president of
Vigilia Mambisa, an exile group in Miami. He uncorked a bottle of
champagne, soaking several people. ``Justice in the U.S. is
working. Everyone is so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Miami is happy. Overhead, a plane droned by
trailing a banner that said ``SEND ELIAN HOME _ The Taxpayers.''
The banner was apparently in reference to the millions of dollars
the standoff, and the demand for added police and other municipal
services, is costing Miami and Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   And, one reporter was stabbed with a ball-point pen by an
agitated demonstrator.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing seemed to dampen the mood among Cuban Americans
here, who see the return of Elian to Cuba as a victory for Castro.
They either discount or ignore the wishes of relatives there for
the boy's return, and view their pleas for his return as communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a little kid,'' said James B. Exposito, 16, a
freshman at Miami High School. ``Over there he doesn't have
nothing. He won't have the love of his family there. They take care
of him here. Everybody will take care of him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the home, a non-Cuban vendor from New York sold T-shirts
with the words ``Elian Lives in America Now'' for $10, or two for
$15.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade mayor, Alex Penelas, who drew criticism from
around the country last month when he openly sided with
demonstrators and said he would not use the county's police to
assist in removing Elian from the home, encouraged the
demonstrators to rally around the house, but ``to do so in a
peaceful manner and not infringe on the rights of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health experts have said that the crowds and noise
and tension that surround the house are harming the boy, who plays
in the yard under the glare of strobe lights. Juan Miguel Gonzalez
has said the Miami relatives are emotionally abusing his son by
filling his head with lies.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowds say they simply cannot let him go, and that this
fight is, even five months old, really just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this ruling, we think it is plain that this is
in fact a very serious appeal,'' said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for
the family. ``And at the same time, no one should make predictions
on the ultimate outcome based on this order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, who has chain-smoked in his yard until the
early morning, keeping his own vigil, walked late Wednesday
afternoon to a neighborhood store. He bought a carton of Marlboros,
and went home to Miami's seemingly never-ending story.

<P>
   Round 1 of the National Basketball Association playoffs will
give some teams three days of rest between games as part of a plan
to help Turner Sports get higher ratings than last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks-Toronto series, for instance, is expected to start
Sunday and resume Wednesday. It may continue the following Sunday,
April 30. If it lasts beyond three games, Game 4 might be played
Wednesday, May 3, and Game 5 possibly on Friday, May 5. So, a
five-game series might last from April 23 to May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current schedule, Game 1 of each of the eight
first-round series will be played Saturday or Sunday. The second
games will be staggered from Monday to Thursday. The Game 3s will
be played from April 28 to April 30, said Brian McIntyre, a
spokesman for the NBA. The Game 4s will be seen the following
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The Game 5s will be played May 4 or
May 5.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling change is part of Turner's current television
deal, but could not be implemented last season because the lockout
forced a tight playoff schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The extended first round will eliminate doubleheaders carried by
Turner's TNT and TBS networks in competition against each other.
The NBA felt it was counterproductive to have playoff games compete
against each other. Now, TBS will primarily carry Monday night
games, and TNT will show the doubleheaders, a plan that is expected
to yield higher ratings. No games in the playoffs on TNT, TBS or
NBC will air in competition against each other.

<P>
   For years, anti-poverty efforts have stressed work, education
and marriage as the way up the economic ladder for the single,
jobless mothers who seemed to account for the bulk of urban
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new analysis of census data shows that in New York City,
in the midst of an economic boom, poverty rates rose sharply among
just the kind of families with children that were supposed to be
safe: those that include two parents, a worker and a household head
with more than a high school degree.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing three years ending in 1998 with the last comparable
stretch of prosperity, in the late 1980s, the study found that the
overall rate of poverty in New York City among families with
children climbed to 32.3 percent from 29.3 percent, despite a rise
in education and employment that would have been expected to reduce
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The official federal poverty threshold is $13,133 for a family
of three.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Wednesday by the nonprofit Community Service
Society, suggests a collision of several trends: the growing gap
between rich and poor, a surge in immigration and, as welfare
changes push recipients off the rolls, increasing competition for
low-end jobs with eroding wages.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic interpretation is that new immigrants are a
major factor and that as they assimilate, they will move up and
into the middle class. But more ominous trends are seen by Mark
Levitan, the author of the study and a policy analyst at the
Community Service Society, which has been tracking poverty for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in education and increases in jobs were outweighed by
the emergence of a ``new poor'' within groups long considered
largely immune to poverty, he said, as middle rungs of the economic
ladder disappear.
</P>
<P>
   For example, poverty rates rose by 10.6 percentage points for
families headed by people with some college, and increased by 4
percentage points for families headed by someone with a bachelor's
degree or more. Poverty also rose for families that included one
worker _ by 8.2 percentage points _ even as poverty rates fell by
6.9 percentage points for families with no worker present.
</P>
<P>
   And for families headed by a married couple, the poverty rate
rose by 6.7 percentage points, even as the rate dropped by 5.1
percentage points for families led by women.
</P>
<P>
   The study echoes recent reports by the state comptroller's
office that have highlighted an increase in payroll jobs paying
less than $25,000 a year, coupled with a decline in the number of
payroll jobs paying higher wages, and a study by the nonprofit
Fiscal Policy Institute tracking a sharp increase in the working
poor in New York City that has outpaced a similar trend in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The working poor include people like Doris Argueta, a cashier at
the Metropolitan Opera House cafe, who looks at the furs and
jewelry of operagoers and wonders why her wages were stuck in the
$6 an hour range for two years and still have not risen above $7.66
an hour, despite a push by employees to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I think because I don't speak very well English
they're going to pay like that,'' said Argueta, 32, who left El
Salvador seven years ago and shares a two-room apartment with her
child and an unrelated family.
</P>
<P>
   They also include John Hunter, a 37-year-old native New Yorker
and a married father of six, who feels he gained no real ground
moving from $6 an hour as a security guard in the late 1980s to $7
an hour buffing floors and scrubbing toilets from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.
in a building near Wall Street for a large cleaning company.
</P>
<P>
   His wife works fluctuating hours at a shoe store on Staten
Island, where she is making $7.45 hourly after three years. ``We're
finding it very hard to pay bills,'' Hunter said. ``I'm not getting
ahead at all, not with the wages I'm being paid and no benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't supposed to happen,'' said David R. Jones,
president of the Community Service Society.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that the signs documented in the new study were
``ominous'' coming as they do at the height of an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Mead, a professor of political science at New York
University who has written extensively in support of the welfare
overhaul, disagreed, calling the increase in poverty small compared
with the sharp reductions in city welfare rolls. Families are
better off over all if they earn money rather than getting it from
welfare, he said, even if their incomes drop.

PRINCE HASSAN, PART OF EGYPTIAN DYNASTY, DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Prince Hassan Aziz Hassan, a cousin of the last
king of Egypt and a great-grandson of the Khedive Ismail, who built
modern Cairo and the Suez Canal, died here on Sunday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few surviving members of the Mohammed Ali dynasty,
Hassan lived in obscurity in the country that his family ruled from
1803 until the 1952 revolution. He was a pianist and an artist,
although he was not permitted to exhibit his work.
</P>
<P>
   After King Farouk was deposed in a coup led by Gamal Abdel
Nasser, Hassan did not flee with the rest of his family. He pursued
his art in Cairo, selling to collectors in Europe and the United
States and staying out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Prince Aziz, was a founder of the Wafd Party, which
fought British colonial rule. In a sign of taboos that persist on
news of the Mohammed Ali dynasty, Hassan's death was noted in the
Egyptian press only with a brief mention in the Wafd newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan had recently completed a memoir, ``In the House of
Mohammed Ali: A Family Album,'' which the American University of
Cairo Press will publish.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are two sisters, Princess Khadijah of Cairo and
Princess Aicha, who lives in Turkey.

BURNS TO COACH BRUINS FOR ANOTHER YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harry Sinden had said he didn't like the Bruins' style
of play during Pat Burns' three years as coach. The
president/general manager also said it was going to take some
convincing while meeting with Burns that the team's fortunes and
style could change if he was kept on.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Sinden, Burns, and assistant GM Mike O'Connell
huddled again for another two-hour meeting, and Sinden came away so
confident that all involved are on the same page that he announced
Burns will be back to fulfill the fourth and final year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel that we have to change some things and Pat
agrees,'' said Sinden. ``He thinks we have to change some things
and we agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden acknowledged that he did need to be convinced a bit that
there wouldn't be a repeat of the Bruins' disastrous season
(24-39-19, out of playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think there was some of that,'' he said. ``If all of a
sudden someone would've felt that nothing had to change, I might
have felt different but that didn't come up at all. The three of us
recognized that there have to be a lot of things changed. Personnel
is a big question mark. (For example), if we get the personnel, how
are they going to play? I was pleased (with the discussions).''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he understood the speculation about Burns's job
security, which was rampant for much of the year and reached a
fever pitch on April 9, the Bruins' final regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny that there should have been speculation, there's
no doubt about it,'' he said. ``It started two-thirds of the way
through the season and just grew. We had to sit down and have these
conversations. Pat needed them as much as we did. We've got a plan,
we're going to made efforts to do what we didn't think we did last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call, Burns said he was thrilled to be
coming back, even though he was under stress due to his uncertain
job status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always worry about that,'' said Burns. ``I would've had to
live with it if it were that but I don't think that's what I
wanted. We've made New England our home. We love Boston, we love
the area, we love the Bruins and we didn't particularly want to go
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I just purchased a home in New Hampshire and we
love it up here and this is where we want to be. I felt part of
this team and I grew with a lot of these players and the players
grew with me. Last year's season was difficult for everyone and
some of the players stressed that they didn't want me to go and I
didn't want to leave because we really truly believe this team can
accomplish something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said communication from management to coaching staff
could be improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be a little more accountable to each other
than we were this year and we talked about that,'' said Sinden.
``Sometimes losing begets a lot of things that would never surface
if you weren't losing. We didn't dwell much on what went on this
year. We spent 95 percent of our time talking about what has to be
done for next year. We really got into what we think, the three of
us, has to be done both in terms of the way we play and personnel.
These meetings were extensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he didn't think communication was so much a problem
as that there needs to be more of it. He admitted that he and
O'Connell had problems in the past but they were overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was something that had to be addressed,'' he said.
``When losses pile up, the speculation of me and Mike not getting
along or having a rift. Yeah, we had one rift a long time ago about
Sergei Samsonov and Harry sat us down like two children and gave us
a slap in the head and said, `You two have got to talk.' He was
completely right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lines of communication have to be open a lot more.
Mike can help me and I can help Mike and we can help the team. The
only disagreement we had is we didn't talk enough and we're going
to have to talk a lot more. That's something I'm definitely going
to work on and Mike's going to work on. It's not a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue was how the Bruins were going to get back to a
style that would bring success, not continual failure like last
year when the club was too passive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some things we do have to address and one of
those is the checking style of the team,'' said Burns. ``A couple
of years ago, this club finished probably with the best defensive
record it had ever had. I think we had some success that way and we
have to get back to that grinding style of Bruins' hockey. If we
don't do that, we're not going to have a whole lot of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the year, we certainly tried some things
but I think I tried to stay with the same system with a different
type of team. If there's a responsibility, probably it's that. I
believe in good hard checking and there are two ways to play the
game _ the game with the puck and without the puck and our game
without the puck for us this year wasn't very good. That's
something we're definitely going to have to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties also talked about acquiring some sorely-needed
defensive help and will likely pick up some free agents in the
offseason. Add that to the core of the team coming into training
camp healthy and signed and Burns said he sees nothing but a
positive future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said. ``I'm very excited and happy about being
part of this team. If I would've had to go somewhere else, I
would've because I have to work but I definitely want to be part of
this black and gold team and build for the future of this club. I
always said I'd like to stay here forever and if I could, I would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel this club has something to prove and I think
this club will prove something. This is aside and now I'm just
dying to get back to work and enjoy the rest of the playoffs and
have that mind going about hockey again.''

THANKS TO GATTI, SAME-DAY WEIGH-INS RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti conceded Wednesday that when he is not in training,
his usual weight is ``160 or 165 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   After a pause Gatti added, ``Maybe 170 sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti has spent a lot of time talking about his weight lately,
especially since it appeared he gained 19 pounds _ from 141 to 160
_ in the two days between the weigh-in and a second-round knockout
of Joey Gamache on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti plans to fight on the undercard of the Lennox
Lewis-Michael Grant heavyweight championship on April 29, although
as of Wednesday he did not have an opponent. The scheduled opponent
at 147 pounds, Homer Gibbins, was forced to drop out of the fight
because of a neck vertebra problem, said Pat Lynch, Gatti's
manager. Lynch promised a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever the opponent, the story for Gatti could easily be
his weigh-in. In a move that breaks with recent custom, the
weigh-in has been moved by the New York Athletic Commission to the
day of the fight at Madison Square Garden. Call it the new Gatti
rule, even if day-of-the-fight weigh-ins are a practice that dates
in boxing to the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   After the lopsided Gatti victory over Gamache, in which Gamache
was knocked down three times, there were protests that Gatti might
never have made the weight limit of 141 pounds set for the bout.
Gatti was accused of standing on the scale at the weigh-in barely
long enough to have it register any weight.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which was televising the fight, brought a standard bathroom
scale to Gatti's locker room before he entered the ring, had him
stand on it, and then reported in its broadcast that Gatti had
weighed 160 pounds. Gamache, who has since retired, reportedly
weighed 145 pounds on the evening of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I weighed exactly 141 pounds at the weigh-in,'' Gatti said in
a conference call with reporters Wednesday from his training camp
in the Pocono Mountains. ``If somebody had done their research on
my other fights since about 1995, they would have seen that I've
been making weight and then going to the ring about 15 pounds
heavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had gotten beat up nobody would have said anything. The
problem is, I blew him away in two rounds. He was no opponent for
me, that's what caused this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti said that after the Feb. 24 weigh-in, he drank three
bottles of a sports drink and ate normally. He said the day of the
fight he had a substantial breakfast and one other meal. He said he
did not take fluids intravenously. He also questioned whether the
HBO scale was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a $9.99 scale from Kmart,'' he said. ``It wasn't even
flat on the cement floor. And I had my socks on, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch insisted Gatti made the 141 weight and said he preferred
the former system of having the weigh-in two days before the fight.
Lewis and Grant, who are under no weight restrictions, will still
hold their weigh-in April 27, but all other weight classes will be
weighed April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Jones, a featherweight who will also fight on the
undercard against Paul Ingle of England, the IBF champion, did not
seem happy about having to weigh in at 8 a.m. when he wouldn't be
fighting for at least another 13 hours. But he wasn't sympathetic
to the protests of Gamache's handlers either.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thought Gatti was too heavy, he should have said
something the day of the fight,'' Jones said. ``Talking afterward,
that's a poor excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones did wonder how Gatti gained so much weight so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just jump 20 pounds in one day,'' he said. ``That's
not right. I don't care who you are.''

   NEW YORK _ It's hard enough for a regular New Yorker to find the
perfect home. But if you're 24 feet tall and weigh 10 tons, it is
apparently impossible. Especially if you're picky.
</P>
<P>
   In January, AT&AMP;T Corp. offered to return Golden Boy, the
gold-leafed, Apollo-like statue that originally crowned the
company's lower Manhattan headquarters, to its native city. But two
weeks ago, the company decided to keep Golden Boy, a k a the
``Spirit of Communication,'' outside the company's operational
headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., where he has resided in
suburban bucolia for the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   John Heath, an AT&AMP;T spokesman, said it was a matter of giving
the statue proper placement. ``We were not able to find a suitable
home for him elsewhere,'' he said, ``given the history and
tradition that Golden Boy has.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, who had eagerly welcomed
the offer, said he had been working to find a site that met AT&AMP;T's
approval when word came, two weeks ago, that the company had
changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York welcomes Golden Boy,'' Stern said. ``We would put him
on a pedestal with the Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't, that is, for AT&AMP;T's request that the statue be
situated downtown, where large parks are scarce. The directors of
Washington Market Park, a two-acre park in TriBeCa, rejected the
offer of the statue because of its size.
</P>
<P>
   The city offered AT&AMP;T two other sites, Stern said. One was the
statue's original home atop 195 Broadway near Fulton Street, now
owned by Peter S. Kalikow, a developer. The second was 346 Broadway
near Worth Street, a city-owned office tower that was formerly the
home of New York Life Insurance Co. and once had a bronze eagle on
its roof. But Stern said he would prefer for the statue to be on
the ground, where people could enjoy it ``up close and personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he had been told by the director of the AT&AMP;T
Foundation, Tim McClimon, that AT&AMP;T was also reacting to longtime
employees who objected to moving the statue.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Heath confirmed that ``a handful'' of employees had sent e-mail
messages saying the statue should stay put, but would not elaborate
on AT&AMP;T's decision to keep the statue, except to say that the
company wanted to put it in a museum or park and was unable to find
one. Asked if AT&AMP;T would reconsider if an appropriate site were
found, Heath said: ``We've decided to leave it where it is. I think
that's the best answer to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Golden Boy's official name has changed over the years,
reflecting the evolution of AT&AMP;T. Originally called ``Genius of
Telegraphy,'' the name was changed to ``Genius of Electricity''
after AT&AMP;T was forced to sell Western Union, and then later to
``Spirit of Communication.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It was designed by Evelyn Beatrice Longman, the first female
sculptor to be elected to the National Academy of Design. The
winged statue, which clutches a quiver of thunderbolts in one hand
and an electrical cable in the other, was cast at the Roman Bronze
Works in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn and erected in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the statue had become a Lower Manhattan landmark, it
was removed in 1980, restored and installed in 1983 in the lobby of
AT&AMP;T's new headquarters on Madison Avenue and 55th Street. When
AT&AMP;T decamped again, to 32 Avenue of the Americas, there was no
room for Golden Boy so he was carted to New Jersey in 1992. ``He
goes where we go,'' the AT&AMP;T chairman, Charles L. Brown, explained
after one move.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he can't just commute.

   LOS ANGELES _ Perfect in the preseason, but winless in the
regular season, the Los Angeles Avengers have plenty of room for
improvement heading into tonight's regular-season home-opener
against the Carolina Cobras at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than just getting better?'' Avengers coach Stan Brock
joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of things we need to work on,'' Brock added.
``We didn't play as well as in the preseason games. Everyone knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The good feelings produced from a 2-0 record in exhibition games
was erased last weekend when the Avengers (0-1) were routed, 51-31,
by Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   So were the exhibition victories a meaningless accomplishment,
or was the loss to Grand Rapids merely a small setback?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think it's fair to judge by preseason games,'' Brock
said. ``I think the opponent was better in the first regular season
game than the exhibition games. Those first two teams played guys
that they eventually cut. We lost to Grand Rapids, which is one of
the top teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game against Carolina, the Arena Football League's
other expansion team, marks a contrast in philosophy. While the
Avengers have stocked their roster with veterans, most of the
Carolina roster includes rookies. They are led by former Valley
College quarterback Jim Arellanes, who in 1994 passed for a
state-record 639 yards against Bakersfield College.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said he anticipated making changes, including signing some
new players, in time for next week's game against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   One change that probably won't happen is at quarterback. Backup
Todd Marinovich received a much-publicized tryout with the San
Diego Chargers, but the NFL team decided not to sign him to a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Semptimphelter remains the Avengers' starting quarterback,
and Brock said he didn't anticipate playing two quarterbacks, based
on last week's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're playing well enough that I don't have to make a
change,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A crowd of around 10,000 is expected tonight. ...
Avengers coach Stan Brock said former cornerback Ken Haslip remains
property of the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League
and is not sure when Haslip will join the team.

   ABRAHAM HAS CASH EDGE
</P>
<P>
   With seven months before the election, Sen. Spencer Abraham, the
freshman Michigan Republican, has reached his fund-raising goals
for his re-election campaign, Federal Elections Commission figures
show.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham raised $1.68 million in the first three months of this
year, bringing his total to $6.4 million, according to a commission
report on Saturday. Abraham has $5 million on hand and his campaign
manager, Joe McMonigle, said Abraham hoped to raise $5 million
more.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, Rep. Debbie Stabenow, has raised $3.4
million since announcing her candidacy, $922,803 of which was
raised in the last three months, the report said. She has $2.1
million on hand. Kerin Polla, a spokeswoman for Stabenow, said her
goal is $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   DEMEANOR AT ISSUE IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James P. Moran, D-Va., has found himself in the midst of a
strange situation. On April 7, in the parking lot of an elementary
school and recreation center, Moran was approached by an 8-year-old
boy, who, the congressman said, tried to steal his car. Moran said
that boy told him that he had a gun, and that he would use it.
Moran ``apprehended'' the boy, he said, and took him into the
recreation center to have the authorities take ``appropriate
action.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boy's family says he only told Moran that he liked his
car and thought he was being kidnapped by the congressman. The
family said it might sue the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Moran's Republican challenger, Demaris H. Miller, has called for
Moran to apologize to the family. ``I question such a person's
ability to serve effectively in an institution such as Congress,''
Miller said of Moran. ``This boy is guilty of nothing more than
standing, while black.'' Moran has amassed more than $800,000 cash
on hand for his campaign; Miller has about $27,000.

Or had the young heir been spirited away from harm after his
parents were sent to the guillotine? On Wednesday, two scientists

There's nothing like the right lampshade to shed new light on

constantly. And it should be replaced every five to six years,''
said Roger Cohen, the owner of Aaron's Lamp &AMP; Shade Center on

MANCHILD-THEATER-REVIEW-B&AMP;W -- ``Manchild in the Promised Land,''
Claude Brown's acclaimed autobiography of 1950s New York, is a tale
of boyhood and manhood that could find moving expression as a play
- in theory. But in practice, at least in the one-actor version at
the American Place Theater, the result is a disappointingly bland,
theatrically unimaginative coming-of-age tale. Joseph Edward plays
Claude and others who populate the landscape of this ``promised
land'' of the urban North. (''Manchild in the Promised Land''/The

exhibition for contemporary design, as well as two large tandem
events and 320 gallery shows simultaneously hosted in the city, the
20th century is now the past, too. The Bouroullec brothers

-- Containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel are
maneuvered into position so their lids can be removed underwater
prior to their contents being reprocessed in late march at the
Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant at Sellafield. Falsification of
documents at the plant is only the opening chapter in a chronicle
of woes that has hammered the company's standing in much of Europe,
Japan and the United States where it is fighting to hold on to an
estimated $9 billion worth of contracts to dismantle and clean up
nuclear facilities. (Jonathan Player/New York Times)

   (NYT26) NEW YORK -- April 19, 2000 -- NY-POVERTY-STATS -- For
years, anti-poverty efforts have stressed work, education and
marriage as the way up the economic ladder for the single, jobless
mothers who seemed to account for the bulk of urban poverty. Now a
new analysis of census data shows that in New York City, in the
midst of an economic boom, poverty rates have risen sharply among
just the kind of families with children that were supposed to be
safe: those that include a worker, a household head with more than
a high school degree, and two parents. People receive a meal at the
United Bronx Parents, Inc. in October, 1999. (Librado Romero/The

director Deborah Warner, foreground, with Fiona Shaw, who appears
in Warner's new film, ``Last September.'' Warner made her name as
something of a wunderkind of the British stage, directing
innovative interpretations of classics in London. Then she directed
opera; most recently, she has done experimental stagings of T.S.
Eliot's poem ``The Waste Land,'' and Bach's ``St. John's Passion.''

There are three reasons to replace a kitchen or bathroom faucet: If
it is malfunctioning and cannot be repaired, if the finish is worn
and pitted or if you want to replace an old one with one that is
more stylish. If you have not shopped for fixtures in a while, you
may be surprised at the wide variety. Prices range from about $30

NEW RECIPE, SAME OLD DISASTER FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ In the span of about 10 minutes, Rangers second
baseman Luis Alicea, his teammates and 39,294 fans ran the gamut of
emotions, ranging from incredible elation to sinking depression.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea watched Ivan Rodriguez hit a game-tying home run off New
York Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera in the ninth inning, ``I said,
`Now, we're going to win. I figured, we come back and shut them
down, then we'll come back in the 10th and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision went poof a few minutes later when Yankees infielder
Clay Bellinger smashed a home run into the left-field bleachers.
``I thought... man, here we go again,'' Alicea said.
</P>
<P>
   He got that right. Bellinger's home run off reliever Jeff
Zimmerman in the 10th inning proved to be the latest fatal blow to
the Rangers against the Yankees, sending them crashing to a 5-4
loss at The Ballpark in Arlington yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Rangers' fifth consecutive to the Yankees this
season, three this week at The Ballpark coupled with two last week
at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Rangers were left fumbling for words in trying
to explain their futility against the defending world champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain,'' starter Rick Helling said. ``We seem
to lose every way imaginable to these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates, ``We should have won today if we make
the pitches we should make and get the hits we should get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't, and that _ more than any jinx, whammy or
voodoo _ explains why they haven't beaten the Yankees this year.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitching has been good, but the bullpen has allowed
10 runs in 111/3 innings. And Rangers hitters were 6-for-45 with
runners in scoring position during the five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro said.
``We either overcome it and become a better team, or we don't. I
don't think they're that much a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   What truly hurts the Rangers is that twice this series they've
rallied against Rivera to tie the score and were unable to win
either time. Rivera had converted 27 consecutive save opportunities
going back to last year until Rodriguez hit his two-run homer in
the ninth inning yesterday to erase the Yankees' 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to their main guy,'' Alicea said, shaking his head.
``The guy's unhittable, and we got to him twice.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't do any more good yesterday than it did in Monday's
5-4, 11-inning loss.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman had struck out three consecutive hitters when he got
ahead 1-2 on Bellinger with one out in the 10th. Zimmerman then
tried to throw a fastball low and away and instead threw it up and
in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge hits a two-run home run, and that's when you go
one-two-three,'' Oates said. ``We gave it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, who also allowed a home run to Bernie Williams in the
ninth, struck out the next two hitters, but the Rangers had no more
comebacks against Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about my line,'' Zimmerman said. ``Anytime
Mariano gives you two runs, it's a huge emotional lift for your
team. You've got to go out there and shut them down. ... That's
what eats at me.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run is Bellinger's second in 65 major-league at-bats.
This is a guy who spent 11 seasons in the minor leagues before
becoming a spare part for the Yankees last year. He was a pinch
runner/defensive replacement yesterday after Jim Leyritz walked
while pinch hitting for Wilson Delgado in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could only shake their heads at the wonder of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Said Palmeiro, ``Just don't look back.''

TENNESSEE ACADEMIC ABUSES CITED BY PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERI BOSTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A review of the academic records of 39 football players and
other athletes at the University of Tennessee found a pattern of
questionable practices, including many juniors and seniors who
never declared a major, many altered grades and a bunching of
athletes in the urban studies department, according to an English
professor who is a longtime critic of the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Linda Bensel-Meyers, plans to release copies of
the records Thursday. She said Wednesday that the athletic
department ``consciously manipulates the athletes' programs of
study to keep them eligible for sports participation with little
regard for a student's progress in a degree program.''
</P>
<P>
   The records, which mainly involve football players and did not
include the students' names, appear to show a number of academic
abuses. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifteen of the 39 student-athletes were juniors or seniors who
had not yet declared a major. Most students do so during their
sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 39 students had accumulated a total of 105 grade changes.
Some changes involved ``incompletes'' that eventually became F's or
D's, not uncommon on many campuses, but many other changes involved
Fs that became much higher grades, including As.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty of the 39 students had been on academic review at least
twice. Students are placed on academic review when their
grade-point average falls below a C, and nonathletes are generally
allowed only one semester on academic review before they are
subject to serious penalties. Student-athletes at Tennessee are
exempt from those rules because of the demands on their time, and
may remain on academic review for many semesters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 18 athletes who had declared a major, 11, or 61
percent, were in urban studies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a concentration of students in one major suggests that it
is a relatively easy course of study and that the faculty members
may be more understanding of athletes with severe demands on their
time, Bensel-Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her review showed that five of the athletes who had
not declared a major were ultimately dismissed from the university
for academic reasons, Bensel-Meyers said. Four of the five were
dismissed after they had used up their athletic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome, along with much of the other findings in her
review, shows that the university works hard to find ways to keep
athletes eligible, but that many do not make appropriate academic
progress, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the core of the problem here,'' she said. ``But no one
is willing to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers was among several current and former professors
and administrators at Tennessee who said publicly last September
that tutors had written papers and done school work for at least
five football players. The university began an investigation into
the allegations, which included the charge that midlevel officials
in the athletic department had tried to cover up instances of
plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   The university ultimately determined that violations of National
Collegiate Athletic Association rules had not occurred, and the
NCAA declined to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Burton English, an economics professor who was chairman of a
faculty panel that looked into the allegations, said on Tuesday
that no major problems had been found in the tutoring program. But
he did say, at a meeting of the executive meeting of the Tennessee
faculty senate in Knoxville, that greater oversight was needed of
the tutoring of athletes. Among his panel's recommendations were
barring tutors from typing papers for athletes and closer faculty
monitoring of many tutorial services, such as note-taking for
athletes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In response, Bensel-Meyers, who still believes that academic
fraud occurred at Tennessee, presented her review of athletes'
academic records to the faculty senate's executive committee on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers said she had collected information from the
records of all 22 starters on the 1999 football team and of many
other athletes who entered the university in 1995; the sample
included some swimmers and track athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the university provost's office seeking comment were
not returned. But English also said of Bensel-Meyers' allegations
and her review of students' records, ``We believe we have addressed
her concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers disagreed. ``There's a conflict when athletics
oversees academic tutoring or counseling,'' she said.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Champagne and exhilaration washed along the street in
Little Havana Wednesday, as a federal appeals court not only
extended an order that will keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the
United States until the court hears the full appeal of his case,
but also criticized the way government officials had handled his
request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, on Wednesday
barred anyone from taking Elian out of the country until the court
hears the child's case on May 11, and, in pointed language,
suggested that his Miami relatives' efforts to have his request for
asylum heard in court should not have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in a legal sense, only a ruling on an emergency
injunction to keep the child in this country for a few more weeks,
but the language seemed to chastise the government for asserting
that only the boy's father was legally entitled to speak for him.
Elian's father lives in Cuba and came to this country early this
month to take the boy back with him.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ensures that questions of who rightfully speaks for
the boy and whether he is entitled to apply for asylum will be
fully aired.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of court concluded unanimously that they
``doubt that protecting a party's day in court, when he has an
appeal of arguable merit, is contrary to the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling lent credence to the Miami family's argument that the
small boy is a bona fide candidate for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But in their conclusion, the judges wrote that the ``true legal
merits of this case will be finally decided in the future,''
adding, ``We need to think more and hard about this case for which
no sure and clear answers shine out today.''
</P>
<P>
   The government could try to have the stay lifted by the full
circuit court or a Supreme Court justice, or take no action until
the hearing in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to pray,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, who defied a federal order last week to give up the
boy and bring him to an airport for eventual reunification with his
Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Miami house, demonstrators celebrated with geysers of
champagne and quiet prayers over clenched rosaries. ``It's a
victory for the Cuban people,'' said Francisca G. Espinosa, 68, a
retiree who lives in Miami Beach. It was unclear if she was
referring to Cubans on this side of the Florida Straits, the other
side or to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not answer a key question: who should have
custody of Elian while the legal process plays out.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service have insisted that Elian be reunited with his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who is waiting for his child at a Cuban diplomat's
house outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding that issue, Attorney General Janet Reno said, the
court left her the option of removing the boy from his uncle's home
_ as she has threatened to do for days. But Wednesday night, it
remained unclear whether she would take such a step, and officials
inside the department indicated they had been surprised by the
court's decision and were confused about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's order does not preclude me from placing Elian in
his father's care while he is in the United States,'' Reno said, as
she stepped off a plane in Oklahoma City, where she had gone to
attend a memorial service for victims of the bombing of the federal
building there five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five months after the boy was found floating on an inner
tube off the coast of Florida in a failed crossing from Cuba that
drowned his mother and 10 others, Elian remained encircled
Wednesday night by demonstrators at the house in Miami, many of
whom have said they will simply not allow the boy to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``We are going to take and consider all our options
and take the course of action that we deem appropriate under the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the reunion of father and son seemed assured. In
March, a U.S. district court judge in Miami upheld an Immigration
and Naturalization Service order to return Elian to his father
without a formal hearing on Elian's request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the INS have said only the boy's
father can speak for him, stressing that common sense dictates that
a 6-year-old cannot understand the complex issue of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court in Atlanta seemed critical of how both
agencies have treated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it appear that plaintiff might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so,'' wrote the
panel, referring to a request for asylum signed by Elian.
``According to the record, plaintiff, although a young child, has
expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes. It is not clear that the
INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the only proper
representative, considered all of the relevant factors,
particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel went on to write that, under the Immigration Service's
own guidelines, a minor can, under some circumstances, apply for
asylum even against ``the express wishes of his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said the ruling allows the Miami family to continue to
turn the boy against his father in what he has referred to as
brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government does not act immediately to remove Elian
from the care of Lazaro Gonzalez and return him to his father, it
will bear responsibility for the harm that continues to be
inflicted on Juan Miguel's beloved son,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has Elian remained in the custody and control of his
Miami relatives, his situation has deteriorated,'' said Craig. Last
week, family members in Miami videotaped Elian in what appeared to
be a coached message to his father, in which the boy said he wanted
to remain in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was another setback for the federal government in a
case that saw the attorney general travel to Miami to try to work
out a deal to reunite the father and son.
</P>
<P>
   That trip that ended with Lazaro Gonzalez saying that if federal
officials wanted the boy, the would have to come into his home,
encircled by supporters, and take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the legal right to remove him, but politically
speaking, it puts his removal very much in question,'' said Pamela
Falk, a professor of international law at the City University of
New York who has argued cases similar to Elian's.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other political experts said the ruling may also
bode well for the family's full appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision scolds the INS for not considering Elian's
interest, and scolds them for not ever speaking to Elian,'' she
said. ``This decision gives a great boost to the possibility of the
success of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the family wins the appeal, it only means that the
boy's asylum request returns to Immigration, and Reno is,
ultimately, in charge of that agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the boy just goes back to Reno,'' Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the fight in Miami goes on to keep the child in the
house and away from a father that many people here see as an agent,
or a puppet, of the Fidel Castro government.
</P>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the family seemed hopeful that they, and an army of
Cuban Americans, could keep the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted,'' said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for the
relatives. ``Had the boy been taken out of the country and we had
won the appeal, what would we have won?''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, said Garcia-Pedrosa, would never have come back from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the house on Northwest Second Street, demonstrators let down
their vigil long enough to joyously celebrate one more victory over
the U. S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a small step, but it is in the right
direction,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has led the demonstration
outside the house since the standoff began five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted ``Fidel, crazy man, you have little time
left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is working,'' said Miguel Saavedra, president of
Vigilia Mambisa, an exile group in Miami. He uncorked a bottle of
champagne, soaking several people. ``Justice in the U.S. is
working. Everyone is so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Miami is happy. Overhead, a plane droned by
trailing a banner that said ``SEND ELIAN HOME _ The Taxpayers.''
The banner was apparently in reference to the millions of dollars
the standoff, and the demand for added police and other municipal
services, is costing Miami and Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   And, one reporter was stabbed with a ball-point pen by an
agitated demonstrator.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing seemed to dampen the mood among Cuban Americans
here, who see the return of Elian to Cuba as a victory for Castro.
They either discount or ignore the wishes of relatives there for
the boy's return, and view their pleas for his return as communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a little kid,'' said James B. Exposito, 16, a
freshman at Miami High School. ``Over there he doesn't have
nothing. He won't have the love of his family there. They take care
of him here. Everybody will take care of him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the home, a non-Cuban vendor from New York sold T-shirts
with the words ``Elian Lives in America Now'' for $10, or two for
$15.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade mayor, Alex Penelas, who drew criticism from
around the country last month when he openly sided with
demonstrators and said he would not use the county's police to
assist in removing Elian from the home, encouraged the
demonstrators to rally around the house, but ``to do so in a
peaceful manner and not infringe on the rights of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health experts have said that the crowds and noise
and tension that surround the house are harming the boy, who plays
in the yard under the glare of strobe lights. Juan Miguel Gonzalez
has said the Miami relatives are emotionally abusing his son by
filling his head with lies.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowds say they simply cannot let him go, and that this
fight is, even five months old, really just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this ruling, we think it is plain that this is
in fact a very serious appeal,'' said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for
the family. ``And at the same time, no one should make predictions
on the ultimate outcome based on this order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, who has chain-smoked in his yard until the
early morning, keeping his own vigil, walked late Wednesday
afternoon to a neighborhood store. He bought a carton of Marlboros,
and went home to Miami's seemingly never-ending story.

COLUMBINE RECASTS GUN CONTROL DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, Daniel Mauser told his father he was concerned about
a loophole in the Brady law that he felt made it too easy for
people to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a passing remark, and Tom Mauser didn't give it much
thought. But two weeks later, his 15-year-old son was gunned down
in the school library by two students on a deadly shooting spree in
a quiet Denver suburb.
</P>
<P>
   It is a year later, and Tom Mauser, who is still mourning his
son's death, is a passionate gun-control advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do something in his name,'' Mauser said of Daniel, a
shy, slender teenager who was good in math and science and loved
videogames but didn't know what he wanted to do when he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is the first anniversary of the massacre at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo. On that day two heavily armed
teenagers stormed the school shortly before noon and during an
hourlong rampage shot to death 12 students and a teacher before
killing themselves. While gun-wielding students have attacked
classmates and teachers at other suburban schools, Columbine stands
as the worst school massacre in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Images of a school turned into a bloody battlefield still
linger, a haunting reminder for parents who saw their greatest fear
become reality.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal impact has been limited. Several states, including
California, passed gun control legislation. But during the same
period, the gun lobby successfully pushed through bills that
protect the industry from lawsuits in 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   Some 31 cities and counties are pursuing lawsuits against the
industry. But legislation on the federal level has all but stalled
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although success with legislation has been limited, gun control
advocates say the school siege has prompted an unprecedented public
outcry. National polls since Columbine show a majority of Americans
favor stronger regulations of guns and stricter enforcement of
current laws. The fervor that has long driven the pro-gun lobby
 &LR; those who oppose limits on guns is now driving gun control
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a change in intensity,'' said Luis Tolley, western
director of Handgun Control. Columbine, he said, shattered the myth
that gun violence is a problem limited to cities, minorities and
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every parent in the country became concerned about sending
their child to school,'' he said. People who had passively
supported gun control now are motivated to take an active role in a
burgeoning crusade against gun violence, Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's father said he supported gun-control laws before the
shooting ``but I never did anything about it.'' After the shooting,
Mauser took a leave from his job as a manager for the Colorado
Transportation Department and is now director of political affairs
for SAFE Colorado, a bipartisan group formed after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I should do something to help close that
loophole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes, say legal experts, may take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a symbolic passage in the American gun battle, (Columbine)
is enormously important,'' Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl
Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley,
said. But in the short term, he said, it might have a greater
impact on the politics surrounding gun control than on laws
regulating the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, gun advocates dismiss the notion of Columbine as
a catalyst for change. While the school rampage intensified media
coverage, they say the public remains skeptical that more curbs on
firearms will stop the seemingly endless stream of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of favoring new restrictions, voters support stronger
enforcement of existing laws, gun advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The two killers at Columbine broke 19 state and federal laws,
said Ed Worley, California liaison for the National Rifle
Association. ``Would having one more law on the books stop the
animals from doing what they did?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control advocates and the NRA represent old adversaries
in a struggle over guns that for years has split along traditional
political lines. Republicans generally have supported the
constitutional rights of gun owners while Democrats have backed
regulations that they say will help keep guns out of the hands of
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist they are morally and legally right, and they
trot out polls to show that they have the support of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   But Columbine blurred the lines between supporters and opponents
of gun controls, especially among lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, gun advocates and opponents have been locked in a
yearlong stalemate, each side blaming the other for being unwilling
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   So far, legislation proposed by gun-control advocates in the
Republican-controlled Congress has been, for the most part, small
change, said Zimring at Berkeley. ``For $1.50 of gun control,
(Democrats) want $1 million impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Columbine, the U.S. Senate passed a series of
modest gun control measures, including a ban on sales to minors and
a requirement of safety locks on handguns. But the measures haven't
budged from a House-Senate conference committee, which met only
once, in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, it's all politics,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, a
conservative Republican from Florida who has opposed previous gun
control measures. ``Both sides don't want to have a bill,'' he
said. ``They seem to want an election issue and not legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   With nothing to show after a year's worth of effort, the House
last week overwhelmingly passed legislation sponsored by McCollum
that would provide $100 million to states that impose mandatory
prison terms for criminals caught with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats dismiss the bill as minor legislation that will
do little to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say they have had far greater success on
the state and local level. In the past year, eight states have
passed gun control laws and three traditionally pro-gun states _
Colorado, Utah and Oregon _ have proposed initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors in New York, Colorado, Illinois and Ohio
who were considered conservatives on regulation have come out in
support of gun-control legislation. Meanwhile, 31 cities and
counties, including San Francisco, are pursuing lawsuits against
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed leader in the gun control movement has been
California, which passed five major laws after Columbine, including
the nation's most comprehensive assault weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the Colorado massacre, the Assembly narrowly approved
a measure that would limit the purchase of handguns to one a month.
Lawmakers rejected a similar bill two years before, but this time,
with the horror of Columbine still fresh in their minds, they
approved the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Gun advocates say that the key to the passage of the gun control
laws was not Columbine but the 1998 election of a Democratic
governor as well as a Democratic-controlled Senate and Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all stuff that they've been trying to get through for
years,'' said Gerald Upholt, manager of governmental affairs for
the California Rifle and Pistol Association, which had opposed each
of the laws.
</P>
<P>
   While those favoring gun control agree that Davis' support was
critical, they see this as an issue that crosses party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly that gun safety is a kid issue,'' said
Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, the Berkeley Democrat who co-sponsored a
safety locks bill. ``That's what Columbine said to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And where there are children, there are parents. So while the
usual political adversaries continue to spar, a powerful new
lobbying force has entered the gun debate.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day, May 14, sponsors of the Million Mom March
expect more than 150,000 people to descend on Washington, D.C., to
rally in favor of gun regulations. Backers say a total of 1 million
mothers and their families are expected to demonstrate at the
nation's capital and at satellite rallies in 30 cities, including
Oakland, Sacramento and Los Angeles. And not all of them will be
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the gun movement's Woodstock'' said Mary
Leigh Blek,cq  &LR;  an honorary chair of the march. Blek, a lifelong
Republican from Orange County, has been working for gun regulations
ever since her 21-year-old son, Matthew, was shot to death during a
robbery in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is a nonpartisan issue,'' said Blek, western
regional director of the Bell Campaign, a grass-roots group
striving for gun laws on the local, state and national level. She
said that many Republican women support gun control laws, unlike
many of the party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Million Mom March is going to show our power,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, gun advocates have had the power for years, and
they point to some legislation in the past year that shows they
still have considerable political might: a ban on cities and
counties suing the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has passed in 17 states and is pending in two
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people don't have a very strong belief that gun
control laws are effective in solving gun violence,'' said Jim
Manown, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax,
Va. ``I don't think any of these tragic incidents have resulted in
any change in public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said that support for the NRA has never been
stronger. The organization boasts a membership of 3.5 million, with
300,000 new members joining since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Mauser, Daniel's father, who has been working in support of a
Colorado initiative aimed at closing the loophole that allows those
who purchase guns at gun shows to avoid background checks, said he
initially was frustrated after state lawmakers failed to pass the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his job managing transit for a car-loving state
prepared him ``for the realities of being a David against
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's going to take to stop the gun
violence,'' he said. ``Obviously it's going to take a lot.''

GIULIANI AND MRS. CLINTON ARGUE ON DONATIONS AND ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, N.Y. _ Seeking to draw links between the candidates
and the donations they receive, the Clinton and Giuliani Senate
campaigns Wednesday accused each other of accepting soft-money
contributions from questionable donors.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton called on the Giuliani campaign to return
a $100,000 donation that was made to a soft-money committee
supporting his candidacy by a company that she referred to as ``No.
1 polluter in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign officials, meanwhile, questioned how a
soft-money committee supporting Clinton could have accepted a
$22,000 check from a Miami businesswoman who investigators said
once solicited a large Democratic campaign contribution from a man
who later pleaded guilty to smuggling heroin into the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign returned that contribution, from Vivian
Mannerud, on Tuesday. ``Some information came to my campaign's
attention and we immediately returned a donation that was
questionable,'' Clinton said, ``and I would ask the mayor if he
intends to keep $100,000 from the No. 1 polluter in America.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to a $100,000 check made to a soft-money
committee supporting Giuliani, the Giuliani Victory Committee, by
Renco Group, a New York company that owns a Utah company that
federal officials had identified as the top toxic chemical dumper
in the nation. The donation was then transferred to the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, which is also supporting
Giuliani's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say whether the check would be returned. ``They
haven't given a donation to my campaign,'' he said, emphasizing
that the money was going to the senatorial committee.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Giuliani campaign questioned how the Clinton
campaign could have accepted a soft-money contribution from
Mannerud. Congressional investigators found that in 1995, Mannerud
solicited a $20,000 contribution to the Democratic National
Committee from Jorge Cabrera, who later pleaded guilty to smuggling
6,000 pounds of heroin into the country. The contribution was
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign officials also noted that the Renco Group had
also donated to Democrats and quickly fired off a list of Clinton's
donors they found questionable, from Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, the
hip-hop impresario facing gun charges in New York, to Christie
Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's communications director, Howard Wolfson, called the
list a distraction. ``The issue is that the single biggest
contributor to Rudy Giuliani is the largest polluter in America,''
he said. ``That speaks for itself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The barbs that were traded over campaign contributions
threatened to overshadow Clinton's main theme of the day, the
environment, and the barbs the candidates traded over that.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with environmentalists in Huntington on Wednesday
at Coindre Hall, a former Gold Coast mansion that is now a park
overlooking Long Island Sound, Clinton cited a judge's 1999
decision holding New York City responsible for dumping pollutants
from its sewage plants into the sound, the East River and Jamaica
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly hope that the mayor and the city would do
what is necessary to end the illegal dumping in the sound and take
the steps that are required to protect the watershed,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if she won a seat in the Senate she would work to
pass legislation to spearhead a cleanup of the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Nolan, a spokeswoman for the Giuliani campaign,
retorted in a statement, ``Maybe Mrs. Clinton will blame the vast
right-wing conspiracy for killing the lobsters in Long Island
Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign, in turn, accused Clinton of representing
Tyson Foods, the Arkansas chicken company that was accused of
polluting neighboring bodies of water with its chicken waste.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laughed when she was told of the accusation, saying that
while her old firm, the Rose Law Firm, represented Tyson Foods, she
personally did not.

EXCERPTS FROM APPEALS COURT RULING BARRING BOY'S REMOVAL FROM THE
U.S.
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBA-BOY and CUBA-BOY-JUSTICE) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the ruling Wednesday by the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta that extended a court
order keeping Elian Gonzalez in the United States:
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez (``plaintiff''), a 6-year-old child from Cuba,
has made his way to the United States. Plaintiff, as an alien,
submitted an application for asylum to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. His father asked, in effect, that the
application be withdrawn. After an investigation, the INS _
deciding that plaintiff could not apply for asylum himself and that
under the circumstances, only his father could seek asylum on
plaintiff's behalf _ concluded that there was no reason not to
honor the father's request and, accordingly, refused to consider
plaintiff's application. Plaintiff then brought suit in Federal
District Court challenging on several grounds the INS's refusal to
consider his application. The district court rejected plaintiff's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff has appealed the district court's decision to this
court. His appeal is scheduled to be argued orally next month.
Plaintiff, however, now moves for an injunction ``to preclude
[plaintiff's) physical removal from the jurisdiction of the United
States during the pendency of this appeal.'' We conclude that
plaintiff is entitled to such an injunction and grant the motion.
</P>
<P>
   In considering a motion for injunction pending appeal, we
examine four factors: (1) whether the movant is likely to prevail
on the merits of his appeal; (2) whether, if we do not issue an
injunction, the movant will suffer irreparable harm; (3) whether,
if we issue an injunction, any other party will suffer substantial
harm; and (4) whether an injunction would serve the public
interest. Although the first factor is generally the most
important, the movant need not always show that he probably will
succeed on the merits of his appeal. Instead, where the ``balance
of the equities weighs heavily in favor of granting the
[injunction)'' the movant need only show a ``substantial case on
the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the balance of the equities weighs heavily in
favor of enjoining the removal of plaintiff from the United States
pending appeal. And plaintiff has made a ``substantial case on the
merits'' of his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Balance of the Equities''
</P>
<P>
   The equities, in this case, weigh heavily in favor of issuing an
injunction pending appeal. Apart from concern about what might
happen to this child if he is returned to Cuba (which we do not
address), if plaintiff leaves the United States during the pendency
of his appeal, his case will likely become moot. Our failure to
issue an injunction pending appeal, therefore, could strip the
court of jurisdiction over this case and deprive plaintiff forever
of something of great value: his day in a court of law. That
circumstance alone presents a significant risk of irreparable harm
to plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, we doubt that an injunction would harm the INS.
Plaintiff has been in the United States for nearly five months. The
INS refused to consider plaintiff's application for asylum more
than three months ago. The INS, however, has not sought to remove
plaintiff in the meantime from the United States. The suggestion
that an injunction pending appeal, prohibiting the removal of
plaintiff from the United States until plaintiff's expedited appeal
is decided on the merits, will harm the INS is not compelling. ...
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Substantial Case on the Merits''
</P>
<P>
   This case is mainly about statutory construction and the proper
exercise of executive discretion. Among other things, we must
ultimately decide what Congress meant when it said:
</P>
<P>
   Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who
arrives in the United States ... irrespective of such alien's
status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section or,
where applicable, Section 1225(b) of this title.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff argues that the INS's refusal even to consider his
application violates United States Code Section 1158(a). The INS
contends that, because plaintiff is a 6-year-old child, he is
incompetent to submit an application on his own behalf and that, on
the facts of this case, he must have his father submit the
application for him. Because his father did not do so, the INS
contends that plaintiff never actually applied for asylum and that,
therefore, no application exists for its consideration. Even
accepting as we do the principles of deference set out in Chevron
vs. Natural Resources Defense Council, we at this time have doubt,
in the light of the record and plaintiff's arguments on appeal,
about the correctness of the INS's interpretation of Section 1158.
</P>
<P>
   In considering an agency's interpretation of a statute, we first
must examine the plain meaning of the pertinent statutory language:
``If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the
matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to
the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.'' The statute in
this case seems pretty clear. Section 1158(a)(1) provides that
``any alien ... irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for
asylum.'' Plaintiff appears to come within the meaning of ``any
alien.'' And the statute plainly says that such an alien ``may
apply for asylum.'' We, therefore, question the proposition that,
as a matter of law, plaintiff (unless his father consents) cannot
exercise the statutory right to apply for asylum. ...
</P>
<P>
   The INS has not pointed to (nor have we found) statutory,
regulatory or guideline provisions which place an age-based
restriction on an alien's ability to apply for asylum. And we have
found no pre-existing requirement that a minor, in submitting an
asylum application, must act through the representative selected by
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it appear that plaintiff might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so. According
to the record, plaintiff _ although a young child _ has expressed a
wish that he not be returned to Cuba. He personally signed an
application for asylum. Plaintiff's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez,
notified the INS that plaintiff said he did not want to go back to
Cuba. And it appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the INS is correct that plaintiff needs an adult legal
representative for his asylum application, it is not clear that the
INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the only proper
representative, considered all of the relevant factors _
particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum. It does not appear that the INS ever spoke to or
interviewed plaintiff before making this determination. And Lazaro
Gonzalez, plaintiff's great-uncle, is no stranger to plaintiff. The
INS placed plaintiff in Lazaro's care upon plaintiff's arrival in
this country, and Lazaro is a blood relative. When Lazaro submitted
applications for asylum on plaintiff's behalf, Lazaro was the INS's
designated representative to take care of plaintiff and to ensure
his well-being. Lazaro's interests, to say the least, are not
obviously hostile to plaintiff's interests. So, for now, we remain
unconvinced that the asylum application submitted by Lazaro on
behalf of plaintiff necessarily was ineffectual under the law.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons and in these circumstances, we believe that
plaintiff has presented a substantial case on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion
</P>
<P>
   By its nature, this order sets out more questions than answers.
We have not attempted to address every point advanced by both
sides, but we have attempted to explain our decision to grant the
injunction. No one should feel confident in predicting the eventual
result in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The true legal merits of this case will be finally decided in
the future. More briefing is expected. We intend to hear oral
arguments. We need to think more and hard about this case for which
no sure and clear answers shine out today. Still, because of the
arguments presented as well as the potential inconsistencies of the
INS.s present position with the plain language of the statute and
with the INS's own earlier interpretations of the statute in INS
regulations and guidelines, and because of the equities in this
case, we conclude that plaintiff is entitled to an injunction
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it is ordered that: (1) plaintiff Elian Gonzalez, is
enjoined from departing or attempting to depart from the United
States; (2) any and all persons acting for, on behalf of, or in
concert with plaintiff, Elian Gonzalez, are enjoined from aiding or
assisting, or attempting to aid or assist in the removal of

AGE-RELATED PHILOSOPHIES ARE A FACTOR IN WORKPLACE LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Workers decry the loss of loyalty from
employers. Employers bemoan the lack of loyalty from employees.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is like that old ``Is it a breath mint or is it a
candy mint?'' commercial: Stop. You're both right. It's two, two,
two truths in one.
</P>
<P>
   No employer guarantees lifetime or even long-term employment.
Businesses downsize, outsource, merge, sell, reorganize, cut costs.
At the same time, workers keep their eyes open and resumes ready _
or suffer shocked self-pity when they're suddenly searching for
re-employment.
</P>
<P>
   This two, two, two truths in one job market underlies Carol
Kinsey Goman's consultations with corporate clients. The Berkeley,
Calif.-based author and behavioral-change expert considers the
loyalty factor when helping employers attract and retain employees.
</P>
<P>
   At a Kansas City Institute for Management Studies seminar, Goman
said employers needed to understand that workers have different
perceptions of loyalty, depending on their age and experience.
Those perceptions paint different backdrops for accepting and
adapting to workplace change. Her categories and broad
characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   The veterans: The born-before-1946 crowd has been through two
world wars, a stock market crash and a major economic depression.
They respect military-model authority. They save for a rainy day
and are accustomed to delayed rewards. They believe you're lucky to
have a job at all, so hold on to it and don't complain.
</P>
<P>
   The baby boomers: The postwar population bulge, born from 1946
to 1964, grew up with anti-war protests, quests for equal or civil
rights, and experimentation in drugs and sexual freedom. Their
sheer numbers made tough competition for jobs and for promotions.
They question authority but, in the end, believe that in return for
hard work and dedicated service, their employer will notice and
reward them with boosts up the career ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X: The group born from 1965 to 1979 came of age in a
video world where TV brought information to them fast, with fewer
words and more images. They grew up techno-savvy and are prime
picks in the computer-reliant job market. They saw vets and boomers
ousted, knew the ``paternal corporation'' was history, and
concentrated on building individual skills, expecting to transfer
easily from job to job. Loyalty goes to whatever project they're
personally working on at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The millennials: This Generation Y, or baby boom echo, born
after 1979, is the ``multitasking, twitch-speed'' generation.
Comfortable juggling many things at once and moving on quickly if
bored or dissatisfied, they expect constant, instant recognition
and rewards. Accustomed to helping their families make decisions
about buying computers and such, they expect a place at the
corporate table when decisions are made that affect them. They
don't demand handholding career guidance; they ``want the remote
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless organizations accept the overarching age-related
philosophies of their work forces, the two, two, two truths in one
head-butting about loyalty will continue, and everyone will profess
befuddlement about what's gone wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in 1996, the issue wasn't all that complicated.
If Madame Tussaud's of London brought its legendary wax museum to
the Big Apple, exactly what would New Yorkers want to see?
</P>
<P>
   But Manhattan focus groups provided answers that were
underwhelming at best, said Andrew Tansley, the English director of
the Tussaud's Group Ltd. Tansley would observe through a one-way
mirror as city residents mumbled politely about seeing a mix of
urban icons, historic figures, rock stars, politicians and sports
legends. But few city residents in the focus groups had actually
been to Tussaud's, only half had ever heard of it, and many said
that the American wax museums they had seen were awfully cheesy.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tansley would open a door and bring in Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it wasn't really Arnold. It was a life-size Tussaud wax
sculpture dressed in a tight white T-shirt and slacks. It had cost
$50,000 and had taken six months to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were gob-smacked by the uncanny likeness, and the
reaction was extraordinary,'' Tansley recalled. ``They said things
like, `Look at the tiny veins,' and, `Those eyes are really
creepy.' And that's exactly the tremendous sense of excitement
we're aiming to bring to New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, very much like the excitement Tansley will try to create
next week: at a press conference outside Tussaud's in Times Square,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will present to the world the $50,000 wax,
um, dummy for which he posed. (No, Hillary Rodham Clinton, his
opponent in the U.S. Senate race, is not yet ready for her close-up
with a wax sculptor.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is the beginning of a $2.5 million publicity blitz for
Madame Tussaud's New York. (In England, the surname is generally
pronounced tuh-SAWDZ, but Francophiles pronounce it to rhyme with
modes.)
</P>
<P>
   The new Tussaud's museum intends to bring the English
institution's fixation with fame to the new Times Square,
showcasing the company's patented high-camp amalgam of breathtaking
portrait artistry, creepy glitz and what can only be called a jolly
fascination with gruesome spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story $50 million wax palace is under construction at
234 W. 42nd St., between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, behind the
landmark facade of the old Harris Theater &UR; .  &LR; Tussaud's is aiming
for an opening date in October.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 200 planned wax-prone notables in the new
museum will be a Who's Who of celebrities appearing only in the New
York Tussaud's. They include Woody Allen, Maya Angelou, Josephine
Baker, Katie Couric, Joe DiMaggio, Amelia Earhart, Henry Ford, Bill
Gates, Wayne Gretzky, Ernest Hemingway, Matt Lauer, Annie
Leibovitz, Mickey Mantle, Joe Namath, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
Yoko Ono, Dorothy Parker, Gov. George Pataki, Gen. Colin Powell,
Christopher Reeve, Sitting Bull, Liz Smith, Donald Trump and Andy
Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair guess that few focus groups floated the names of
Sitting Bull or Dorothy Parker, and Andy Warhol's 15 minutes have
long since slipped through the glass. But Tussaud's generally goes
for a certain level of renown, ``those who have shaped history of
one sort or another,'' said Tansley _ a conviction that perhaps
explains why the Spice Girls will be present and accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the New York Tussaud's will also offer crowd-pleasing
wax images that appear in the London Tussaud's, including Diana,
Princess of Wales; the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Larry King, Nelson
Mandela, the Dalai Lama and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Tussaud's Group, which attracts revenues
estimated at $55 million a year, will not reveal its sensations
cheaply. Ticket prices will range from $12.75 to $19.95; visitors
are expected to stay an average of two hours.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After customers are beamed up to the top floor in two exterior
glass-walled elevators, they will be welcomed to Tussaud's by wax
sculptures grouped in a fantasy ``Opening Night Party'' for a
mythical Broadway show. Downstairs, a summit of world leaders will
be arrayed in a United Nations-ish room called the Gallery. An
adjacent exhibition, ``Behind the Scenes,'' will feature a
multimedia description of the monthslong creation of a likeness of
the television weatherman Al Roker.
</P>
<P>
   And for an extra fee, in an attraction called ``It Happened in
New York,'' visitors under a 40-foot dome will be transported on a
virtual hansom-cab ride to a series of iconic events in New York's
history, including Elvis Presley's first appearance on ``The Ed
Sullivan Show'' and the Broadway ticker-tape parade for the Apollo
11 moon voyagers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tony Peluso, Tussaud's American director, said that the New York
museum would not be a replica of the ones in London, Amsterdam or
Las Vegas. ``We don't want to be the same in any city, anywhere in
the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the grander ambition of Tussaud's is to import the
implacably weird spirit of the original. For all its strangeness,
the London Tussaud's has acquired a certain brummagem elegance
because of its relationship with the celebrities who pose for
portraits, including the Royals (every reigning British monarch
back to George III has sat for a museum sculptor). ``We hope to
create a similar cachet and tradition in New York City,'' Tansley
said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tussaud's is going for traffic as well: 6,000 to 7,000 people on
peak days, or 1.8 million visitors a year. But it may prove
difficult to transplant one of London's most popular tourist
attractions (it draws 2.7 million visitors a year) to a city where
it must compete with everything from Broadway shows to the Statue
of Liberty and the new Rose Center planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   Another daunting task for Tussaud's is ``to overcome the
negative association that Americans have with the poor-quality wax
museums here,'' said Jim Garber, an independent Los Angeles-based
consultant for entertainment attractions that include Disney World,
Universal Studios and the Six Flags amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tussaud name isn't known in the United States,'' Garber
said, ``and it will be a challenge to educate Americans about what
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tussaud's strengths are that ``their likenesses are done very
well, they have a legacy going back to Madame Tussaud, and they
encourage visitors to go right up to the wax figures and have their
pictures taken with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, with its new 49-year lease with a 50-year extension,
Tussaud's is bullish on America, and perhaps not without reason.
Since the 18th century, Tussaud's has made much of the artistry of
its wax images, created using the technique of the founding diva,
Madame Tussaud.
</P>
<P>
   Its likenesses are prepared by artisans who take 250 intricate
measurements of celebrities' body proportions and create the
sculptures from visual observation and photographic analysis. Each
face is built up from a 30-piece plaster mold, which is filled with
wax, then painted. The acrylic eyes are positioned from inside the
mask, and hair is inserted strand by strand.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Celebrities have offered vast sums for their own Tussaud's
portraits; such requests are rejected. Many celebrities, or
would-be celebrities, have volunteered themselves for waxdom, only
to be rejected by Tussaud's. The museum itself has been turned down
_ it won't say by whom _ most frequently by movie stars working too
hard on film locations to spare the three hours for a proper
sitting. Others try to stiff-arm the Tussaud's sculptors until they
have lost a few more pounds. Unlike other such museums, Tussaud's
prefers subjects to pose, although it has created sculptures from
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Marie Tussaud was sprung from imminent guillotining in
revolutionary Paris so she could create death masks of aristocrats,
including Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Napoleonic wars to England in 1802, she toured her
portrait museum on wagons throughout Britain for 33 years before
establishing a permanent London museum in 1835. Tussaud's has
occupied its current location near the Baker Street subway station
for 116 years.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will be spared the full gory London experience:
victims being garroted in a torture chamber, Marat being knifed in
his bath, Joan of Arc being burned at the stake, and the figure of
Vlad the Impaler with a victim's bloody head on a stake. Indeed,
the very phrase ``chamber of horrors'' was coined to describe the
grisly sights in Tussaud's basement, and the phrase has been
appropriated by Tussaud's ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned, though: in the new museum, there will be an
exhibition called ``Madame Tussaud's Story.'' It will show her
hobnobbing with Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon and Josephine, all of
whom she sculpted. And, as might be expected, customers will be
offered tableaux of the guillotine, and Madame hunting through
piles of bloody chopped-off heads so she can create her legendary
death masks, some of which will be on view.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tableaux depicting Madame Tussaud rising above
historical gore, Tansley said: ``This is not something that we made
up; this is actually what happened to the real woman who founded
our company. She was put in the Bastille and had her head shaved in
preparation to having her head chopped off.'' Spared thanks to her
experience as a sculptor, she died in London in 1850 at the age of
89.
</P>
<P>
   But those New Yorkers with more delicate constitutions will be
alerted. Tansley said that there would be a large sign outside the
guillotine room that will warn the squeamish, so, he said
helpfully, ``those who have no lust for blood can bypass this
completely.''

GAY MARRIAGE BALLOT PETITION FAILING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CHRISTOPHER HEREDIA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Two California brothers' uphill battle to
qualify a gay marriage ballot measure for the November general
election ballot is expected to fail Thursday, falling hundreds of
thousands of signatures short.
<P>
   And while that's no surprise after the passage of Proposition
22, which banned gay marriage in the state, many gay rights
advocates worry that legislative support for less sweeping domestic
partners bills may suffer because of the proposition's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have an impact,'' said Eric Astacaan, a lobbyist with
the gay rights advocacy group, California Alliance for Pride and
Equality. ``That's why we're trying to lobby members of the
Legislature to tell them that while people voted for Proposition
22, that was about marriage and this is about domestic partnership.
Even the pro-22 campaign pointed out that gay and lesbian
relationships should have equal protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, others are looking enviously upon Vermont where the
Senate Wednesday passed a bill creating ``civil unions,'' a legal
structure parallel to marriage for gay and lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the political spectrum in California, the
conservative Committee on Moral Concerns is working hard in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Committee ... opposes any steps toward equalizing domestic
partnership with marriage,'' said the group's executive director
Art Croney. ``It's misplaced compassion to affirm the most
dangerous lifestyle in America, which is the gay lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, some California lawmakers are seeking
incremental rights for gay partners. There are five domestic
partner bills covering everything from making medical decisions in
an emergency to inheriting property to making funeral arrangements
to the right to sue for wrongful death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step-by-step quest for liberty,'' said openly lesbian
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, who last year
authored a bill establishing a domestic partner registry for both
gay and straight couples whose members are 62 years of age or
older.
</P>
<P>
   The law also granted health benefits to the domestic partners of
state workers and hospital visitation rights to all registrants.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Migden has introduced a bill that would grant
domestic partners the right to consent to have his or her partner's
organs donated in the event of death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Knight Initiative's passage, Migden said she thinks
a majority of her colleagues in the Legislature will support the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think gay marriage is timely,'' Migden said. ``These
bills have to do with entirely different subject matter. They're
very mundane and straightforward, basic parity issues which are
largely uncontroversial.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly Minority Leader Scott Baugh, R-Huntington Beach,
said he can't predict the outcome. He hasn't studied the bills, but
differed with Migden's assesment.
</P>
<P>
   He said his general philosophy is to not grant ``special
privileges'' to gays.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Proposition 22, he said, ``may impact the
governor's decision, but not votes in the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Majority Leader Kevin Shelley, D-San Francisco, said
the governor's opposition to Proposition 22 and his nod last year
to the domestic partner registry may be an indication of his
support for the domestic partner bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not marriage,'' Shelley said. ``That's a significant
stretch. What Proposition 22 did was show that a majority of
Californians are not comfortable with gay marriage. What the polls
indicate is that they are supportive of strengthening domestic
partner rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition drive to qualify a gay marriage initiative hasn't
gotten much publicity or received the funds spent by the
Proposition 22 campaign, an estimated $6 million. It's been largely
Internet-driven and without much door-to-door campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Henning a single, 35-year-old San Francisco teacher, who
began the petition drive with his brother last year, conceded it's
a ``formidable effort'' to get the measure on the ballot, but
that's not stopping him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying it's the wrong timing, but ...
we're not trying to be pragmatic,'' Henning said. ``If we're not
successful this time, we'll be back again. This issue is very much
in the forefront of the minds of gay and lesbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Henning calls domestic partnership ``a poor second cousin to
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, his group, Californians for Same Sex Marriage,
had gathered nearly 100,000 of the 670,000 signatures needed. They
have until Thursday to complete their effort.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's Castro District one recent afternoon, some
said the petition drive is an exercise in futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a worthy endeavor,'' said Levi Stolove, a 22-year-old
teen center coordinator from San Francisco, ``but I think a lot of
work needs to be done to convince people that if heterosexuals can
get married, then gays should be able to as well.''

BOMBING SUSPECT ORDERS LAWYERS NOT TO ARGUE AGAINST DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A defendant in the bombing of a U.S. Embassy in
Africa has ordered his lawyers not to go to Washington next week to
argue against the death penalty with Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-`Owhali, has been charged
with helping carry out the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya in
August 1998. The government has described al-`Owhali as a would-be
suicide bomber who wanted to die in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that al-`Owhali rode as a passenger in
the truck that carried the bomb to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, and
that he later admitted to investigators that the bombing was
intended to be a ``martyrdom operation in which he did not expect
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-`Owhali's lawyers had been planning to appear before a
committee of Justice Department lawyers in Washington, in hopes of
persuading Attorney General Janet Reno not to seek al-`Owhali's
execution, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Al-`Owhali's request that his defense lawyers forgo the meeting
apparently so troubled them that they went before Judge Leonard B.
Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan last Friday, seeking
guidance on how to reconcile their ethical duties with their
client's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really primarily at a loss to know what our
obligations were,'' one lawyer, David I. Bruck, said in court,
explaining that al-`Owhali's request appeared to conflict with
their duty to represent his interests zealously.
</P>
<P>
   Sand, after receiving assurances that al-`Owhali was of sound
mind, said the request could be followed.
</P>
<P>
   Al-`Owhali, who has pleaded not guilty, is one of three
defendants in custody who could face the death penalty for their
roles in the attacks on the embassies in Kenya and in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. The two attacks killed more than 200 people and
wounded thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Under Justice Department rules, the death penalty decision
begins with local government prosecutors, in this case the office
of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in Manhattan. She and prosecutors on
her staff met last month with al-`Owhali's defense team, after
which she indicated that she would seek the death penalty. White
then sought formal permission from Reno, who has the final say.
</P>
<P>
   But after the defense lawyers were invited to appear before
Reno's staff, al-`Owhali told them not go, two of his lawyers told
Sand last week. The lawyers' attendance is not mandatory, and Reno
can act without hearing from them.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, Bruck and Leonard F. Joy, the federal defender for
New York, initially appeared before the judge in a closed hearing,
out of the presence of prosecutors and the public. Al-`Owhali was
also present.
</P>
<P>
   Such private meetings are sometimes held when the defense has a
particular issue to raise that could reveal defense strategies.
Later, a transcript was filed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Joy explained that the lawyers had planned to meet
with Justice Department officials to argue against the death
penalty, but said al-`Owhali ``has informed us that he does not
wish us to go down to that meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruck then explained the ethical quandary. ``We felt on the one
hand that we did not want to do something contrary to the wishes of
our client,'' he said. ``On the other, we are officers of the
court, and we felt that this is an integral part of the process in
a matter in which not only the defendant and the government, but
the court and the public as a whole has a very substantial
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruck told the judge that the defense lawyers had made an
earlier written submission to the government opposing capital
punishment, a document that has not been withdrawn. He said
al-`Owhali had told his lawyers why he did not want them to go to
the meeting, but he did not reveal the reasons in court. Al-`Owhali
did not speak at the hearing, the transcript shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sand asked, ``Is there any doubt in your mind as to your
client's mental capacity or the rationality of his instructions to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, your honor,'' Bruck said.
</P>
<P>
   Sand indicated that he saw no problem in the lawyers' following
their client's request. ``The question of whether the government
will seek the death penalty is one with respect to which the
defendant has a very great interest,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   A legal ethics expert, Stephen Gillers, professor of law at New
York University, said the lawyers acted ``entirely appropriately in
asking the judge to approve their decision to comply with their
client's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with gray areas,'' Gillers said, ``and the
gray areas involve death as one of the possibilities, you don't
want to guess wrong.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Transportation.com, an Overland Park, Kan.,
Internet company for shippers and the trucking industry, has named
former U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner as chairman
of its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who also served as chief of staff during the Bush
administration, said he agreed to work with Transportation.com
because technology is on the verge of changing the way freight is
moved, both in the United States and globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was comfortable they had a good business plan,'' Skinner
said, ``and they thought I could bring some real value.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said he was introduced to the Overland Park company by
EnerTech Capital Partners, one of the three firms that invested $30
million in the start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation.com is an online marketplace for shippers and
trucking firms. The company plans to match truckers with available
loads; provide tracking, maintenance and other information; and
help shippers cut prices. It also will offer an auction service for
used equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Corp. and two venture capital firms invested $30 million
to form Transportation.com earlier this year. About a dozen
customers are testing the system, which is expected to be launched
late this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation.com will give small and medium-size businesses
``the same type of technology and services available to companies
like General Electric and General Motors,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small and medium-size company has traditionally done its
own shipping, and it probably hasn't been the most efficient way to
do it,'' Skinner said. ``Right now, with business going globally
and just-in-time shipping requirements, the need for efficiency is
greater than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   James D. Ritchie, chief executive of Transportation.com, said he
was ``surprised and enthused'' when Skinner agreed to take the
chairman's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I think I can add value to your company. If you're
just looking for a spokesmodel, I'm not your guy,' '' Ritchie said.
``He's taking a hard look at a lot of things, asking, `How do you
really change the industry?' He's looking far out into the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   As secretary of transportation in the Bush administration,
Skinner oversaw a budget of $30 billion and 105,000 employees.
Later he served as president of Commonwealth Edison.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an individual of Sam Skinner's background to step out and
join the e-revolution going on in the transportation industry is
important for the industry as a whole,'' said Ting Piper, program
manager for e-logistics services with IDC, an Internet market
research company based in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Skinner sits on several corporate boards and is a
lawyer and co-chairman of Hopkins &AMP; Sutter, a Chicago law firm.

COWBOYS INTERESTED IN RODNEY PEETE (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys are showing an interest in recently
released Washington Redskins quarterback Rodney Peete, although
owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that the team will take a
wait-and-see attitude toward the 11-year veteran's availability
until after the April 28-30 minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys need to see how the pecking order behind Troy Aikman
shakes out. This minicamp will mark the first time coaches will get
a chance to see 31-year-old quarterback Paul Justin, who was signed
as an unrestricted free agent from the St. Louis Rams last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll sure take a look at \R Peete\S,'' said Stephen Jones,
Cowboys' director of player personnel. ``We had him before \R1994\S
and really liked him then. Our coaches will continue to evaluate
him and see if he could be a fit here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Peete, 34, hasn't been a full-time starter since tearing the
patella tendon in his right knee in Week 5 of the 1996 season with
Philadelphia. He has been mostly a backup each of the past three
seasons with the Eagles (1997-98) and Redskins (1999).
</P>
<P>
   When the Redskins signed Jeff George to back up starter Brad
Johnson, Peete became expendable and was released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, who has had 10 starts in five NFL seasons with three
teams, is considered the favorite to win the Cowboys' No. 2 job
because of his experience.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys will keep an eye on the situation because Peete,
who backed up Aikman in '94 (appearing in seven games with one
start) knows the offense that offensive coordinator Jack Reilly and
pass-offense consultant Ernie Zampese are bringing back to the
Cowboys this season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys pursue Peete, it would probably be for the
$440,000 league minimum for a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Peete's agent, Tom Condon, could not be reached for
comment.Star-Telegram yesterday.]
</P>
<P>
   In his NFL career, Peete has thrown for 13,686 yards and 61
touchdowns (compared with Justin's 2,614 yards and eight TDs).
Peete originally was drafted by Detroit, where he was a starter
most of his five seasons with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Quinn, 26, will be given a chance to compete with Justin
for the Cowboys' No. 2 QB job. Quinn, who has no NFL starts in
three seasons, held the No. 3 job last season although he didn't
appear in any games.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett, Aikman's longtime backup, defected to the New
York Giants in February via unrestricted free agency, leaving the
Cowboys without a seasoned No. 2 quarterback prior to their signing
Justin. \Nsubheds:Free agents sign The Cowboys signed three more
undrafted rookie free agents yesterday, bringing the total to 17 in
three days. They are Alabama State wide receiver Damon Hodge, who
is 6-foot-1 with 4.5-second speed in the 40; Troy State defensive
end Aaron Fields, 6-4, 243 pounds; and Utah State punter Micah
Knorr.

TWA BLAMES LARGER QUARTERLY LOSS IN PART ON SOARING FUEL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Trans World Airlines on Wednesday said higher
fuel prices contributed to a larger loss for the first quarter of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh consecutive quarterly operating loss for the
St. Louis-based airline.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's operating loss was $103.92 million for the three months
that ended March 31, compared with a $37.59 million loss in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, TWA executives said that the airline's financial
results began improving in March and that the turnaround was
expected to continue through the second quarter. One industry
analyst said that could lead to a better performance for the
struggling airline in the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, TWA's net loss was $76.12 million, or
$1.16 a share, on $809 million in revenue. During the same time
last year, TWA lost $21.56 million, or 42 cents a share, on $764.59
million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's fuel costs in the first quarter nearly doubled compared
with the same period last year, said William F. Compton, TWA's
president and chief executive officer. In addition, the company had
higher aircraft leasing expenses and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, which operates its main jet overhaul base at Kansas
City International Airport, also experienced lighter passenger
traffic in January because of year 2000 concerns, Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the quarterly loss would have been greater if
TWA had not begun replacing its older planes with a newer fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fuel costs would have been $29 million higher if we had
not started to renew the fleet in 1996 and accelerated (the
renewal) in 1999,'' Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that TWA was beginning to see productivity improvements
as its work force gradually continued to shrink through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   TWA also started seeing revenue improvement in March, which has
continued into this month, Compton noted. Regional jet service,
recently introduced into TWA's route structure, has begun to show
benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said TWA's first quarter was in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't stunningly good, but it wasn't exceedingly bad,''
said David W. Levine, contributing editor to PlaneBusiness, an
electronic financial newsletter on the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said TWA's yield, an industry measure of financial
performance, seemed to have improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring a substantial surprise, TWA could post a modest profit
in the second and third quarters,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's on-time performance, which has been the best among the
major carriers for most of the past year, also should begin to draw
more business travelers, Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a lag time, but we're getting close to where
people will start to take notice,'' he said. ``If they continue to
put up those on-time numbers, it will help.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA was unchanged at 1 7/8 in trading Wednesday on the American
Stock Exchange.

YANKEES' START BRINGS TO MIND THE WONDERS OF '98 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Even to the New York Yankees who experienced
it, the 1998 season is mythic in their minds. Unbelievable, they
say of winning 114 games during the regular season. Unreal, never
to be repeated. They might as well be talking about feats of
Hercules.
</P>
<P>
   They have played just 14 games in this season, but the plot
lines have an uncanny similarity to 1998, as if genes were
extracted from that team and injected into the first evolving cells
of these Yankees. Victories are drawn from the most remote parts of
this roster, just as in '98: Lance Johnson made a rare start
Wednesday and pitched in with four hits and two stolen bases, and
Clay Bellinger hit a tiebreaking home run in the top of the 10th
inning as the Yankees edged the Texas Rangers, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees win games that maybe they should not win.
Wednesday, Mariano Rivera blew his first save chance since July 16,
1999, surrendering a two-run homer in the ninth inning to Ivan
Rodriguez, and Bellinger bailed him out the very next inning. Most
notably, these Yankees, like the '98 Yankees, do not lose. They
have won eight consecutive games, their longest winning streak
since 1998, and they are 11-3 over all, the best record in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   The '98 Yankees had superlative starting pitching, and the
Yankees' rotation is evolving into a formidable force this year.
Orlando Hernandez has been dominant, David Cone is beginning to
pitch effectively again, and Wednesday, Roger Clemens had his first
strong outing, allowing two runs in the first seven innings before
a strained back forced him out of the game at the outset of the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was great,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, who does
not believe Clemens' injury will prevent him from making his next
scheduled start.
</P>
<P>
   Torre wanted to see Clemens throw more strikes Wednesday, get
ahead in the ball-strike count and exploit hitters. Clemens _ who
had been annoyed by suggestions that he was being tentative with
his fastball _ attacked the Rangers with his signature pitch
Wednesday. He fired strikes on the first pitch against 14 of the
first 18 batters he faced; his first 11 pitches were fastballs,
thrown 91 to 94 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy wind blew through this area Wednesday afternoon, and
Clemens began feeling stiff in the fifth inning, with the Yankees
ahead, 1-0. Johnson scored that first run and, after the Rangers
tied the score in the bottom of the sixth, he led off the seventh
with a double into the right-field corner. When the Rangers' Rick
Helling forgot to check Johnson at second, Johnson stole third and
scored on a groundout. In the eighth, Jorge Posada doubled and
swiped third base before Johnson singled him home. The Yankees led,
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens threw only 85 pitches in the first seven innings but, as
he warmed up for the eighth, Torre could see him struggling to get
loose. Clemens fell behind, two balls and no strikes, against the
leadoff batter, Chad Curtis. Torre went to the mound and relieved
Clemens, patting him on the back as he departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was fine, and I told him that,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed 12 walks in his first 18 innings this season, but
against the Rangers, Clemens permitted just one walk in the first
seven innings. ``That's the Roger Clemens we know,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson relieved Clemens and surrendered a run-scoring
double before Torre called for Rivera with one out in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Rafael Palmeiro was coming to bat, Torre would usually use
the left-hander Mike Stanton. But Palmeiro had two hits in two
at-bats against Stanton this season, a double and a homer. Knowing
that the Yankees have Thursday off, Torre called on Rivera and
asked him to get the last five outs.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera maintained the lead into the ninth inning, when Bernie
Williams increased the advantage to 4-2 with a remarkable home run.
Williams reached far over the plate, his weight shifted to his
front foot, and he drove a low pitch to straightaway center field,
over the wall. When Williams returned to the dugout, the coach Don
Zimmer squeezed Williams' left biceps and asked how in the heck he
could have hit that particular pitch so far.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera got two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning,
sandwiched around a double by Ruben Mateo. Rodriguez, the Rangers'
All-Star catcher, was inserted into the game as a pinch-hitter.
Rivera planned to throw him a fastball inside, and catcher Posada
set his target. Inside.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera's darting fastball broke over the outside corner
instead; Rodriguez leaned and drove the ball down the right-field
line. Paul O'Neill raced toward the corner, toward the foul pole,
looked up and saw the ball land just inside the yellow screen.
Rivera barely reacted, his vacuous stare never changing, even
though it was the first time he failed to convert a save chance in
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should've won in the ninth,'' he said later, ``but I blew
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied, 4-4, after nine. In 1998, the Yankees
expected to win in these situations, assumed they were going to
win. As they returned to the dugout Wednesday, Bellinger said
later, there was no sense of disappointment over Rivera's failure.
Somebody said aloud that it was time to get a run; another player
suggested two runs. Business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman threw a high fastball to Bellinger, and Bellinger
bashed it, breaking into a home run trot almost immediately as he
watched the ball depart. His teammates burst from the dugout to
greet him. Yankees 5, Rangers 4.
</P>
<P>
   Torre wanted Rivera to get another chance, hold another lead _
and Stanton had been struggling _ and so the closer pitched the
bottom of the 10th inning. His outing of two and two-thirds innings
was his longest in almost four years.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was shaking hands with teammates, observing another
victory, another sweep, and the Yankees headed for Toronto, looking
to build on their winning streak.  &QL;

INVESTOR RAISES QUESTIONS ON SOTHEBY'S BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Baron, the New York money manager whose funds
are the largest shareholders in Sotheby's Holdings Inc., has
questioned the auction house board's independence in a filing with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Baron funds have invested about $500 million in Sotheby's,
which is a target of a federal antitrust investigation, and the
filing may signal an effort by Baron to elect new directors to the
board, now dominated by people aligned with Sotheby's former
chairman, A. Alfred Taubman.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman resigned from the board Feb. 21 as a result of the
investigation, which people involved in the case say has focused in
part on him. He has denied wrongdoing. Taubman retains voting
control of Sotheby's through ownership of a majority of the Class B
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's Antitrust Division is looking into
whether Sotheby's and its rival auction house, Christie's,
conspired in 1992 and 1995 to fix commissions charged to buyers and
sellers and engaged in other collusion. Christie's has said it is
cooperating with the inquiry, and Sotheby's has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the independence of Sotheby's board were in
a filing by Baron with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
became public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The filing said Baron had hired an investment banker,
Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co., to give advice on the Sotheby's holdings
of his four funds. It did not mention an intention to sell, and
Baron has described himself as a passive, long-term investor in
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, Baron has had conversations with the
management and directors at Sotheby's that involved the board's
``composition and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing said Baron supported Sotheby's executive officers but
opened the possibility that he would seek to elect his own
directors,
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is to expand its board to 14 members from 10 at its
annual meeting on April 27 in London. Holders of Class B stock will
elect 10 members, and the additional members are to be elected by
the Class A stockholders. The Baron funds hold 55.2 percent of the
Class A stock.

KINGS WILL TEST LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Given their preference - albeit a quietly stated
preference - the Los Angeles Lakers would have taken a first-round
playoff series against the Seattle SuperSonics, a team they felt
they could sweep. Instead, they drew the always-pesky Sacramento
Kings, who never let them rest.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that's not such a bad way to start the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that this team has played well against us, we'll have
to play better to beat them,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``And
that's always a positive thing. You want to play your best
basketball at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to against the Kings, who although inconsistent are
deep and talented. The Lakers lost by 12 points to the Kings in
December, then won the last three meetings by an average of 3.7
points. Sacramento could easily have won any of them, and Jackson
called the Kings ``a team that's going to demand our best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they're going to be a team that's going to be
hard to control,'' Jackson said. ``They're a team of spurts, and
they break games open, or they run away from teams early in
ballgames, and we're just going to have to be prepared to play a
48-minute game and not rest on one quarter or what happens in a
half. And just play the ballgame, as we have found out. And we've
been able to come back from deficits and beat this team. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be tested at some level, and sometimes it's
good to be tested in the first round. They tested Utah (taking them
to five games) last year, gave them a little test in their series
and obviously grew into the respect that they deserved during that
playoff series.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiss his asterisk: Given the opportunity, Jackson did not waver
from his prior contention that San Antonio's championship last
season deserved an asterisk because of the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The comment, made two weeks ago, didn't go over well with the
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it caused some flare here in town,'' Jackson said,
``but you know, this is what it is. You don't have to hammer it
home. Everybody knows what kind of year it was here in the NBA last
year, a 50-game season. Roger Maris had an asterisked season (when
he hit 61 home runs), he played (162) games instead of 154.
Asterisk seasons are seasons that aren't the same. That's all.
There is a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: After giving him a one-week rest, the Lakers are
expected to activate Derek Fisher from the injured list today and
place him on the postseason roster. But Jackson wouldn't say it's a
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing given yet,'' he said. ``We're still looking
to see how he does.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fisher, nursing a bone spur in his right ankle, is activated,
rookie John Celestand will go back on the injured list.

HOW THE COLUMBINE SHOOTINGS CHANGED US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Columbine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year later, that word still has the power to disturb us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Littleton, Colo., two teen-age boys gunned down 12
classmates and a teacher in a rampage fueled by pent-up anger and
alienation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our first reaction was horror. But then the worries grew more
personal. Could this happen here? Are we doing everything we can to
make sure it doesn't? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shock of Columbine has receded, but Kansas City-area
parents, teachers and students still feel its shadow. Today, six
area residents talk about how the events of April 20, 1999, have
made them more vigilant. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The counselor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time they're teen-agers, it may be too late. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High School massacre made that clear, and the
recent shooting death of a Michigan first-grader underscored the
point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So now counselor Debbie Kern pushes her fourth- and fifth-grade
students to talk about what's bothering them. She teaches them how
to handle the peer pressure and teasing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do it here, we can't blame the middle school and
high school,'' said Kern, who works at Cottonwood Point Elementary
School in the Blue Valley district. ``There's got to be a pattern
somewhere before that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One strategy is to prepare students to cope without resorting to
violence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of her students, for example, worried about being stuffed
into lockers when they got older. So last week Kern took them to a
middle school. They measured the lockers and discovered how hard it
would be to cram someone inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long before Columbine, Kern had worked with the Stop Violence
Coalition Inc. in Kansas City, helping parents and teachers
recognize bullying. Demand for the program has skyrocketed since
the Littleton shootings, where the teen-age killers were said to
have been victims of bullying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National statistics show that 160,000 children stay home from
school every day because they fear classmates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Kern strives to reach children early. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to frighten them. Yet it's kind of a frightening
time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Through a student's eyes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No trench coats at school. More security cameras. New course
work about staying ``connected.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, high schools went on high alert after Columbine.
But for the ``different'' kids at school, the ones receiving more
scrutiny, the changes felt strange, even repressive. And sometimes
still do a year later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Hewitt, a 17-year-old from Gladstone who's a junior at Oak
Park High School, is drawn to Goth themes, industrial music and
black clothing. All things Goth became suspect in the early days
after Columbine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the tragedy, Hewitt distributed a flier at
school explaining that Goths were fascinated with the topic of
death but had no connection to racial intolerance or violence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying that just because we're all upset about this we
don't need to point fingers,'' said Hewitt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's Goth-ness isn't necessarily evident. She dresses ``in a
million and one ways'' besides black. She's an athlete and a rugby
player. And she floats fairly easily among the high school
subcultures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An impact of Columbine, she has noticed, is that the
``different'' students, feeling a bit besieged, have kept more to
themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And adults continue to size students up based on clothing, she
said. The trench coat ban makes no sense to her: ``I see a trench
coat as I see cargo pants; I mean, 14 pockets, how can you beat
that?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt realizes teachers and parents are trying to read the
warning signs. But to prevent something like Columbine, she said,
peers, teachers and parents need to look beyond the clothes young
people wear. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The officer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Prindle is a cop. His beat: Grandview High School. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Columbine, the school resource officer has delved deeper
into the lives of teens who are overly aggressive or prone to
violence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several times, he's heard from students that a classmate is near
the boiling point. Prindle and the principal let the student know
they're there to help. If needed, Prindle may send a student to a
counselor or even to family court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prindle always keeps an eye out for students who threaten or
tease others. He says it's smart business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take a little extra time in evaluating what we
think we're seeing,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prindle thinks schools need more than prevention. He plans to
show the school staff a training video, developed after Columbine
by Kansas City police, that outlines how police respond to mass
shootings and how teachers can minimize loss of life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before Columbine, Grandview school officials had decided to
set up a tip hot line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the tip line made its debut in October, most of the 15 to
20 calls have been about drugs or fights. Nothing worse. Next year,
Prindle hopes to give out gift certificates and other incentives to
call in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine is probably a good wake-up call with every school in
America,'' Prindle said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The student mediator &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two young men in high school, and one accuses the other of
swiping a dollar off his desk. Sharp words and glances. Bumps in
the hall. Threats about what tomorrow would bring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like such a small thing _ a missing dollar bill _ but
Leslie Patterson knew how disputes could escalate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to fight,'' said Patterson, an 18-year-old
peer mediator at Central High School in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Columbine for Patterson is that small slights have
a way of boiling up over time. In this clash, no one had mentioned
guns or knives _ yet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it made us realize, you never know what will affect
another student,'' Patterson said about the Littleton, Colo.,
shootings. ``You never know how and when somebody will react to
being bullied or talked about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patterson sat down with the feuding students to ask questions
and take notes. The accuser acknowledged he couldn't be sure who
took the dollar. Still, emotions were too high for a handshake.
Instead, the two agreed to steer clear of each other: no comments,
no gestures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They signed a contract and they stuck to it,'' said
Patterson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an outcome that makes Patterson proud. At least since
middle school, she's had a knack for bringing people together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a psychologist,'' she said. ``I like talking to
people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If she does pursue a career in counseling, Columbine will stick
with her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's opened a lot of people's eyes,'' she said.
``Students are capable of doing something like this because they
have so much bottled up inside, or because of something going on at
home, and they just explode.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A principal's view &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When principal John Laurie heard rumors about a gun at school,
he reacted swiftly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He ordered police dogs to search Shawnee Mission West High
School and directed staff members to question students. The rumors
turned out to be false. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools have always taken the threat of a gun seriously,''
said Laurie, who has been an administrator for 25 years. ``But
since Columbine, schools have more procedures and more options in
place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sometimes feels overwhelmed at the idea of trying to
keep his 1,950 students safe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students at Shawnee Mission West are much like the ones at
Columbine, Laurie thinks. They are culturally diverse, middle- to
upper-middle-income kids who strongly support their school's sports
teams and activities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like students everywhere, they have more exposure to
violence than kids of generations past. They can find it easily on
the Internet, in video games and in movies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fears bred by Columbine have prompted schools to be less
flexible when students cross the line. Suspensions for threats are
almost a certainty now, Laurie said, even for a ``good kid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, though, parents and students are more likely
now to report a problem at the first hint of something wrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``More kids are talking to teachers about things they notice
outside school,'' Laurie said. ``The kids have caught on that
talking about things helps make school a safer place.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A worried mom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ginefra naturally worries about her two daughters. But
Columbine has intensified those worries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She calls their school, Rosedale Middle in Kansas City, Kan.,
more often than before. The wail of sirens sometimes prompts her to
dial the school _ she knows the number by heart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And she frets until someone answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're almost afraid to hear what it is,'' Ginefra said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When someone let off pepper spray earlier this year, the
stay-at-home mom jumped in her '80s-model Jeep Cherokee and headed
to Rosedale to be with her daughters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Columbine, Ginefra said, the middle school has added metal
detectors. They annoy her children, but have been a relief to
parents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``(The kids) are there every day, but parents aren't there so
they worry more,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ginefra said the media have overblown coverage of school
violence since Columbine, and she wants to hear more about students
being educated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are kids out there making beautiful music with a bow and
strings,'' she said. ``I think people are ready for those kinds of
stories.'' &QL;

IN NEW JERSEY PROFILING CASE, DEBATE CENTERS ON DRIVER'S STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In the two years since two New Jersey State
Police officers wounded three unarmed men _ all members of minority
groups _ in a van on the New Jersey Turnpike, the case has set off
an intense policy debate about ways to prevent troopers from
targeting black and Latino drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the criminal case against the two officers advances,
defense lawyers have begun using the van driver's own words to
argue that, whatever discrimination problems may afflict the state
police force, the shooting was justified because the troopers
believed their lives were in danger when the van accelerated toward
them.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed this week, a defense lawyer revealed that
the van driver, Keshon Moore, told the grand jury that he might
have accidentally stepped on the gas pedal, causing the vehicle to
lurch toward the troopers. Moore made a similar statement to police
the night of the incident, according to Robert Galantucci, a lawyer
for Trooper John Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that `I can't blame anyone but myself, it was my
mistake,' '' Galantucci said in an interview Wednesday. ``To me, it
seems like an honest kid trying to tell the truth, and the fact
that he said it before he lawyered up makes it all the more
believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's lawyer, Peter Neufeld, said that his client's statement
on the night of the shooting was a symptom of survivor's guilt _
that Moore felt obliged to claim responsibility for the situation
because his three friends had been wounded and he had not. But
Neufeld insisted that Moore never told the grand jury he stepped on
the accelerator and argued that the expert witnesses who examined
the scene concluded that the van did not accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not Keshon Moore's position when he spoke to the grand
jury that he put his foot on the accelerator,'' Neufeld said. ``And
the experts testified that there was no evidence that the car ever
accelerated. It was moving approximately 4 mph. So whatever guilt
he might have felt that night, whatever he might have said, it is
really not relevant.'' He added, ``I defy any Police Department
anywhere to give an example of a case in which, simply because a
van was moving backward at a couple miles an hour, lives may have
been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's statement, however, has clearly become a central part of
the troopers' defense strategy. Hogan and his partner, James Kenna,
both face charges of attempted murder for the shooting on the night
of April 23, 1998, when they stopped the van as it drove southbound
near Exit 7A in Cranbury.
</P>
<P>
   Galantucci contends that Moore's statements bolster the
troopers' report that the van accelerated, and he has asked that
Judge Andrew Smithson of Mercer County Superior Court Judge dismiss
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man, in a moment of honesty, admitted that he made
the mistake that set everything in motion,'' he said. ``When you
put yourself in the position of what these officers knew at the
moment that van was heading toward them, it's clear they were
justified. The law doesn't demand perfection of people. It only
demands that what these troopers did was reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Special Prosecutor James J. Gerrow is scheduled to file his
response to the motions next month and has declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever weight the legal system eventually gives to Moore's
statements about the incident, the shooting has already changed the
way the New Jersey State Police operates.
</P>
<P>
   Although all three of the wounded men survived, the severity of
their injuries and the fact that officers fired 11 shots set off a
blaze of headlines and brought angry protests by civil rights
leaders who said that racial profiling had been a common occurrence
on New Jersey highways for years.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and two of his passengers are black; the third passenger
is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, whose administration for years disputed a
judge's ruling in 1996 that found evidence of profiling, eventually
ordered her attorney general to investigate the department.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also led to the ouster of Col. Carl A. Williams,
the state police superintendent. The governor forced Williams to
resign after a newspaper published his assertions that blacks and
Latinos were primarily to blame for the state's drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   And in April 1999, Whitman became the first state official in
New Jersey to acknowledge that some troopers did indeed engage in
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, after the U.S. Justice Department completed a
three-year investigation, the state entered a consent decree that
allowed a federal judge to appoint a monitor to ensure that the
state deterred racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal investigators said they found evidence that
some troopers, including Hogan and Kenna, intentionally
misidentified the race of the drivers in their written reports, to
conceal the race of the people they stopped. Those allegations have
led to criminal charges of filing false records against the
troopers. They have pleaded not guilty.

 &HT;    Braves' offense wakes up
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With John Rocker's return came bullpen heroics Tuesday
night. So why not some offensive firepower to follow Wednesday as
Brian Jordan returned to the lineup for the first time since
Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Putting up their highest run total of the season, the Braves
broke out with a 10-1 victory over the Phillies, for their third
win in a row, Tom Glavine's third in a row and the 190th of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won the game on a bases-loaded two-run single from
Javy Lopez in the sixth inning and proceeded to rub it in with a
six-run eighth, five of which were scored before the Phillies
bullpen had recorded an out.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez added a two-run home run in the seventh to match his
career-high with four RBIs. Andruw Jones scored three runs and
homered for the third time this season. Andres Galarraga collected
three hits and drove in a pair of runs to raise his team-high RBI
total to 13. Glavine got in on the act with a single, his third hit
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate Glavine's going, he'll be at 200 in no time.
Fittingly, he got off to a nostalgic start, one of those where he
loaded the bases in the first inning. He got out of his jam _
allowing one run on a Rico Brogna groundout _ when he struck out
Mickey Morandini, but not before he had expended 34 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed one runner past first base from then on until he was
through with seven innings, and that came with the aid of a Walt
Weiss error.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones started the game-turning sixth-inning rally with a
single up the middle after Randy Wolf hit Jordan and Galarraga.
Lopez, who was facing Wolf for the first time Wednesday night,
bounced a single up the middle off him two pitches into his at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones and Lopez had bounced double plays their first
trips to the plate, making that 12 double plays for the Braves in
the past five games. But by the second time through, the Braves had
shaken those tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   They are 6-2 at Turner Field this season and winners of four of
their past five after being swept three games in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant did his best to keep the Braves offense in check,
playing an acrobatic left field to take two more hits away from the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   After robbing Chipper Jones of an RBI hit Tuesday night, he was
back at it Wednesday making two awkward-looking catches in the
fifth.

TROUT FISHING MADE EASY FOR ROOKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL A. ANASTASI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You've wanted to fish. You have no idea how.
</P>
<P>
   This story's for you.
</P>
<P>
   Know the difference between an improved clinch knot, a Palomar
knot and a forget-me-not? Read no further.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever kept nightcrawlers in your refrigerator? Do you
even know that nightcrawlers are !ital!worms?!off! Answer yes, and
there's nothing here for you.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell a treble hook from a treble clef? A rod from A-Rod?
</P>
<P>
   Stop, stop, stop.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story for those who've never been but always wanted to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Trout season opens April 29 in the Eastern Sierra, and it's
expected to be the best opener in years. You will catch fish
because anyone can catch fish on this day. Al Davis will limit out.
Donald Sterling will limit out. Susan Lucci will limit out, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trout fishing is the easiest fishing, yet among the most
enjoyable. The Eastern Sierra - the place our water comes from - is
fantastically gorgeous. You don't need a lot of money. You don't
need a lot of time. You can drive there in time to eat your next
meal. Yes, there are a bazillion people but there are a bazillion
fish and plenty of space.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one weekend, even the most-urban corporate warrior
among you can imagine what it might have been like to be a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   What do I need?: For starters, a fishing license (fee: $28.10),
available at most sporting-goods stores. In California, your
license must be visible as you fish; you can buy a nifty holder
that you can pin to your shirt. And you can keep no more than five
trout a day. There are fishing cops, called game wardens, who will
give you a very expensive ticket if you don't follow fishing rules.
A copy of the regulations is available at the same place you buy
your license.
</P>
<P>
   And then: A rod and reel. If you're over 12, don't buy a
spincasting outfit. You want spinning gear, a rod that releases
line using your index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Buy the cheapest rod you can that doesn't have line already spun
on the reel. You're not advanced enough yet to appreciate the
difference from a more-expensive outfit, but the pre-spun reels
tend to cause a lot of problems for anglers who don't have a lot of
practice casting.
</P>
<P>
   Casting?: Do I need an agent?!off! You do need a little
practice, maybe 10 minutes to master the basic over-handed throw.
Go online to www.gofishing.org for instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?: Now buy your ``stuff.'' Every angler has way more
stuff than he actually needs or uses, but that's part of the
unwritten code of angling that you will learn soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to attract fish: lures, which one casts and
reels in to simulate something swimming in the water (an insect or
very small fish, for example) and bait, which lies still. There's
artificial bait like PowerBait, the most popular brand of trout
attractant, and organic bait, such as worms and salmon eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere like the Eastern Sierra, they all work roughly
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why's that?: Because the state's Department of Fish and Game
raises and then ``plants'' millions of trout in the Eastern Sierra
every year. It puts more than 400,000 trout in Crowley Lake alone.
They're hungry.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of bait?: Get a jar of PowerBait (green is a
favorite), a jar of pink salmon eggs and a cup of nightcrawlers.
Start with the PowerBait and go from there.
</P>
<P>
   And lures?: When you're comfortable with bait fishing, you can
try casting lures. It can be more rewarding and engaging, but it's
easier to mess up. Buy these trout staples: Thomas Buoyant, Rooster
Tail, Super Duper, Kastmaster and Rapala.
</P>
<P>
   How do I attach it?: You need to know how to tie a basic knot,
the Palomar being the easiest (illustration this page; you can also
buy knot-tying pamphlets at sporting goods stores). The lure or
hook attaches via what's called a swivel snap. Buy a package of
those, too.
</P>
<P>
   With baits, you'll need to use a leader. Basically, you attach a
small weight to the end of your line. From that, you attach a
3-foot-or-so line with the hook attached to the end. The weight
will fall to the bottom of the water, and the bait will float up.
</P>
<P>
   That's a drag: Now, put 4-pound line on your reel (4-pound test,
in angling parlance). What's 4-pound line? That means you should be
able to land a fish weighing up to 4 pounds before it breaks,
though that's not really true. Skilled anglers can land much
heavier fish.
</P>
<P>
   Now set your drag (ask for help on this if you can't figure it
out) to 1 pound. The drag controls the tension on the line. Imagine
a game of tug-o-war: 10 guys on one side and one on the other (the
one being the fish) is a heavy drag, two guys on one side and one
on the other is a light drag.
</P>
<P>
   The proper way to set your drag is to hang a 1-pound weight to
your line; when it starts the reel spinning, you're there.
</P>
<P>
   Why does that matter?: Lighter line means less line that's
visible to fish; also the lighter the line and the lighter the
drag, the better the fish's fight.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you want the fish to fight? Because that's the fun of
fishing. If you want only to pull the fish out of the water easily,
go to Ralphs.
</P>
<P>
   What do I wear?: Whatever you want, but the key is to be
prepared for everything. It can be sunny and 85 degrees in L.A. and
snowing in the Eastern Sierra. It also can be sunny and 85 degrees
there. Be prepared for snow, rain and sunshine. Bring sunscreen.
Skin-burning UV rays bounce off the snow and water; it can be 45
degrees while you're being seriously burned.
</P>
<P>
   Where do I go?: The Eastern Sierra is a straight shot up Highway
395, which is off the Antelope Valley Freeway (14). If you don't
know where to go, head for Crowley Lake. It's the most accessible,
most well-stocked and largest fishery. Figure six hours to drive
there, and figure plenty of CHP presence.
</P>
<P>
   I'm there, now what?: Toss in your line with PowerBait, and
wait. You will feel your line tug when a trout is nibbling. When
the pole bounces, ``set'' your hook; that is, hook the fish. Do
that easiest by yanking upward. Remember this is a trout, not a
shark; you don't need to yank too hard.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing: Give a spot 15 minutes; if you don't have
anything, move on. PowerBait !ital!will!off! work if there's fish,
generally. Still no luck? Switch baits and lures. You never know
the mood of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   I've got one: Play the fish. Reel gently and steadily. If the
fish fights, let it go. Wait until it tires and reel again. Keep
pressure on the line. If the fish swims right, point your rod left
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Fish aren't stupid: Fish do have eyes. If you make a commotion
as you approach, they will probably swim to somewhere where things
appear calmer. Skilled anglers actually sneak up to their spots
because they know big fish don't get that way by sticking around
when there's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But some people are: It is most definitely uncool to intrude
upon someone else's fishing space - defined here as the distance
one can cast on all sides. If that person is catching fish after
fish, and you're not, that's too bad. Get there earlier next time.
</P>
<P>
   Need a bribe?: Mammoth Mountain has a small, yet respectable
outlet mall. And spring skiing is great, with a 7- to 10-foot base
at Mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   And lastly: Fishing is like anything else: It takes a little
knowledge and practice. Give yourself some time.

TROUT FISHING MADE EASY FOR ROOKIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You've wanted to fish. You have no idea how.
</P>
<P>
   This story's for you.
</P>
<P>
   Know the difference between an improved clinch knot, a Palomar
knot and a forget-me-not? Read no further.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever kept nightcrawlers in your refrigerator? Do you
even know that nightcrawlers are !ital!worms?!off! Answer yes, and
there's nothing here for you.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell a treble hook from a treble clef? A rod from A-Rod?
</P>
<P>
   Stop, stop, stop.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story for those who've never been but always wanted to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Trout season opens April 29 in the Eastern Sierra, and it's
expected to be the best opener in years. You will catch fish
because anyone can catch fish on this day. Al Davis will limit out.
Donald Sterling will limit out. Susan Lucci will limit out, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trout fishing is the easiest fishing, yet among the most
enjoyable. The Eastern Sierra - the place our water comes from - is
fantastically gorgeous. You don't need a lot of money. You don't
need a lot of time. You can drive there in time to eat your next
meal. Yes, there are a bazillion people but there are a bazillion
fish and plenty of space.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one weekend, even the most-urban corporate warrior
among you can imagine what it might have been like to be a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   What do I need?: For starters, a fishing license (fee: $28.10),
available at most sporting-goods stores. In California, your
license must be visible as you fish; you can buy a nifty holder
that you can pin to your shirt. And you can keep no more than five
trout a day. There are fishing cops, called game wardens, who will
give you a very expensive ticket if you don't follow fishing rules.
A copy of the regulations is available at the same place you buy
your license.
</P>
<P>
   And then: A rod and reel. If you're over 12, don't buy a
spincasting outfit. You want spinning gear, a rod that releases
line using your index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Buy the cheapest rod you can that doesn't have line already spun
on the reel. You're not advanced enough yet to appreciate the
difference from a more-expensive outfit, but the pre-spun reels
tend to cause a lot of problems for anglers who don't have a lot of
practice casting.
</P>
<P>
   Casting?: Do I need an agent?!off! You do need a little
practice, maybe 10 minutes to master the basic over-handed throw.
Go online to www.gofishing.org for instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?: Now buy your ``stuff.'' Every angler has way more
stuff than he actually needs or uses, but that's part of the
unwritten code of angling that you will learn soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to attract fish: lures, which one casts and
reels in to simulate something swimming in the water (an insect or
very small fish, for example) and bait, which lies still. There's
artificial bait like PowerBait, the most popular brand of trout
attractant, and organic bait, such as worms and salmon eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere like the Eastern Sierra, they all work roughly
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why's that?: Because the state's Department of Fish and Game
raises and then ``plants'' millions of trout in the Eastern Sierra
every year. It puts more than 400,000 trout in Crowley Lake alone.
They're hungry.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of bait?: Get a jar of PowerBait (green is a
favorite), a jar of pink salmon eggs and a cup of nightcrawlers.
Start with the PowerBait and go from there.
</P>
<P>
   And lures?: When you're comfortable with bait fishing, you can
try casting lures. It can be more rewarding and engaging, but it's
easier to mess up. Buy these trout staples: Thomas Buoyant, Rooster
Tail, Super Duper, Kastmaster and Rapala.
</P>
<P>
   How do I attach it?: You need to know how to tie a basic knot,
the Palomar being the easiest (illustration this page; you can also
buy knot-tying pamphlets at sporting goods stores). The lure or
hook attaches via what's called a swivel snap. Buy a package of
those, too.
</P>
<P>
   With baits, you'll need to use a leader. Basically, you attach a
small weight to the end of your line. From that, you attach a
3-foot-or-so line with the hook attached to the end. The weight
will fall to the bottom of the water, and the bait will float up.
</P>
<P>
   That's a drag: Now, put 4-pound line on your reel (4-pound test,
in angling parlance). What's 4-pound line? That means you should be
able to land a fish weighing up to 4 pounds before it breaks,
though that's not really true. Skilled anglers can land much
heavier fish.
</P>
<P>
   Now set your drag (ask for help on this if you can't figure it
out) to 1 pound. The drag controls the tension on the line. Imagine
a game of tug-o-war: 10 guys on one side and one on the other (the
one being the fish) is a heavy drag, two guys on one side and one
on the other is a light drag.
</P>
<P>
   The proper way to set your drag is to hang a 1-pound weight to
your line; when it starts the reel spinning, you're there.
</P>
<P>
   Why does that matter?: Lighter line means less line that's
visible to fish; also the lighter the line and the lighter the
drag, the better the fish's fight.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you want the fish to fight? Because that's the fun of
fishing. If you want only to pull the fish out of the water easily,
go to Ralphs.
</P>
<P>
   What do I wear?: Whatever you want, but the key is to be
prepared for everything. It can be sunny and 85 degrees in L.A. and
snowing in the Eastern Sierra. It also can be sunny and 85 degrees
there. Be prepared for snow, rain and sunshine. Bring sunscreen.
Skin-burning UV rays bounce off the snow and water; it can be 45
degrees while you're being seriously burned.
</P>
<P>
   Where do I go?: The Eastern Sierra is a straight shot up Highway
395, which is off the Antelope Valley Freeway (14). If you don't
know where to go, head for Crowley Lake. It's the most accessible,
most well-stocked and largest fishery. Figure six hours to drive
there, and figure plenty of CHP presence.
</P>
<P>
   I'm there, now what?: Toss in your line with PowerBait, and
wait. You will feel your line tug when a trout is nibbling. When
the pole bounces, ``set'' your hook; that is, hook the fish. Do
that easiest by yanking upward. Remember this is a trout, not a
shark; you don't need to yank too hard.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing: Give a spot 15 minutes; if you don't have
anything, move on. PowerBait !ital!will!off! work if there's fish,
generally. Still no luck? Switch baits and lures. You never know
the mood of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   I've got one: Play the fish. Reel gently and steadily. If the
fish fights, let it go. Wait until it tires and reel again. Keep
pressure on the line. If the fish swims right, point your rod left
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Fish aren't stupid: Fish do have eyes. If you make a commotion
as you approach, they will probably swim to somewhere where things
appear calmer. Skilled anglers actually sneak up to their spots
because they know big fish don't get that way by sticking around
when there's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But some people are: It is most definitely uncool to intrude
upon someone else's fishing space - defined here as the distance
one can cast on all sides. If that person is catching fish after
fish, and you're not, that's too bad. Get there earlier next time.
</P>
<P>
   Need a bribe?: Mammoth Mountain has a small, yet respectable
outlet mall. And spring skiing is great, with a 7- to 10-foot base
at Mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   And lastly: Fishing is like anything else: It takes a little
knowledge and practice. Give yourself some time.

AGE-RELATED PHILOSOPHIES ARE A FACTOR IN WORKPLACE LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
 SUB-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Workers decry the loss of loyalty from
employers. Employers bemoan the lack of loyalty from employees.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is like that old ``Is it a breath mint or is it a
candy mint?'' commercial: Stop. You're both right. It's two, two,
two truths in one.
</P>
<P>
   No employer guarantees lifetime or even long-term employment.
Businesses downsize, outsource, merge, sell, reorganize, cut costs.
At the same time, workers keep their eyes open and resumes ready _
or suffer shocked self-pity when they're suddenly searching for
re-employment.
</P>
<P>
   This two, two, two truths in one job market underlies Carol
Kinsey Goman's consultations with corporate clients. The Berkeley,
Calif.-based author and behavioral-change expert considers the
loyalty factor when helping employers attract and retain employees.
</P>
<P>
   At a Kansas City Institute for Management Studies seminar, Goman
said employers needed to understand that workers have different
perceptions of loyalty, depending on their age and experience.
Those perceptions paint different backdrops for accepting and
adapting to workplace change. Her categories and broad
characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   The veterans: The born-before-1946 crowd has been through at
least one world war and possibly a stock market crash and a major
economic depression. They respect military-model authority. They
save for a rainy day and are accustomed to delayed rewards. They
believe you're lucky to have a job at all, so hold on to it and
don't complain.
</P>
<P>
   The baby boomers: The postwar population bulge, born from 1946
to 1964, grew up with anti-war protests, quests for equal or civil
rights, and experimentation in drugs and sexual freedom. Their
sheer numbers made tough competition for jobs and for promotions.
They question authority but, in the end, believe that in return for
hard work and dedicated service, their employer will notice and
reward them with boosts up the career ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X: The group born from 1965 to 1979 came of age in a
video world where TV brought information to them fast, with fewer
words and more images. They grew up techno-savvy and are prime
picks in the computer-reliant job market. They saw vets and boomers
ousted, knew the ``paternal corporation'' was history, and
concentrated on building individual skills, expecting to transfer
easily from job to job. Loyalty goes to whatever project they're
personally working on at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The millennials: This Generation Y, or baby boom echo, born
after 1979, is the ``multitasking, twitch-speed'' generation.
Comfortable juggling many things at once and moving on quickly if
bored or dissatisfied, they expect constant, instant recognition
and rewards. Accustomed to helping their families make decisions
about buying computers and such, they expect a place at the
corporate table when decisions are made that affect them. They
don't demand handholding career guidance; they ``want the remote
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless organizations accept the overarching age-related
philosophies of their work forces, the two, two, two truths in one
head-butting about loyalty will continue, and everyone will profess
befuddlement about what's gone wrong.

PLANNING KEY TO CHILDREN'S ENJOYMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL A. ANASTASI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His first fishing trip with dad is seared in his
memory and so, he imagined, would be the first trip with his own
boys.
</P>
<P>
   He had all the gear ready. At home, as excitement for their trip
built, he taught them how to use it. He packed their rain clothes,
snow clothes, sunny clothes. He had the sun block, the bug spray,
the skin moisturizer and the first-aid kit. He pre-prepared the
lures, the power bait, the nightcrawlers. He had hot chocolate,
cold soda, a gallon of water, juice boxes and enough food for a
week - plus snacks.
</P>
<P>
   They awoke at 3 a.m. to stake their spot at Crowley Lake, to be
there when the fireworks signaled the beginning of last year's
Eastern Sierra trout season.
</P>
<P>
   Ka-boom!
</P>
<P>
   And then the trip exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, the 5-year-old twins were bored and
wanted to go home. By 5 o'clock that afternoon, he was driving back
to Los Angeles, bitter but perhaps wiser as he pondered a three-day
weekend that wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing with kids presents a unique challenge that, for the
unprepared angler, can ruin any trip. Do it right, though, and you
have opened the gateway to a lifetime of memories and fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids,'' said Oxnard's Kirk Prouse, a professional angler and
guide, ``don't give a hoot what they're catching as long as they're
catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced anglers believe there's nothing more important. For
the young child, who can start fishing between the ages of 4 and 6
depending on his or her temperament, fishing means action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got to take them somewhere where you have a high
percentage of catching fish,'' said Craig Stockton, freshwater
manager of J&AMP;T Tackle in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes trout fishing in the Eastern Sierra so
attractive. With literally millions of trout planted by the
Department of Fish and Game, and the fish extraordinarily hungry
after a winter of growing, Tom Sawyer could catch his limit with a
hook, worm and bamboo pole.
</P>
<P>
   However, when you fish with small children, you must first
understand that the point of the trip is to fish with the small
children. If you're after one to take to the taxidermist, leave the
4-year-old at home.
</P>
<P>
   Engineer Joe Cox of Oxnard takes his kids fishing because he's
looking for quality time in the outdoors. His son and daughter are
small now, but he knows he can establish a lifelong activity that
they can share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone fishing for four hours and thrown my reel for 10
minutes,'' he said. ``All of your attention has got to be on the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pyles of the Camarillo Fishing Club, for whose family
fishing the opener at Crowley Lake is an annual tradition, said
adults also must be prepared to deal with a child's short attention
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my boys were small and they started to get tired of
fishing, I'd whip out some Army men for them to play with. That'd
keep them occupied for a half-hour. After that, I'd pull out a
coloring book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick was to have alternate activities available and
ready. I'd also throw out their line with some bait and usually it
wouldn't take long for a fish to bite. They are thrilled to catch
that fish and after they catch one they'll be all excited about
fishing for another half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyles made it a point to talk about the outdoors with his sons
during their trips as well, pointing out deer, birds and other
wildlife a point echoed by Stockton. That, too, keeps the child
engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it a point to discuss fishing ethics,'' Stockton said.
``I like to get kids into the catch-and-release ethic, to teach
them to take only what they're willing to eat that day instead of
taking trout out of that fishery, throwing them in some foil and in
the freezer and then in the trash three months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teach kids that there are other people out there who want to
catch fish as well.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR KIDS &QL; 
Some pointers for enjoying a successful fishing trip with small
children:
</P>
<P>
   Keep it simple: Spincasting outfits are best because they are
easier to operate, thus leading to fewer problems such as tangled
line for mom or dad to fix. (Spincasting reels are those that are
mounted on top of a rod's handle and releases line by pushing a
button on the reel).
</P>
<P>
   Keep things ready: Your child can't wait to start fishing once
you're at your spot, so don't keep him waiting by having to rig
your gear. Do that at home. Review lures, knots and baiting hooks
at home as well because he or she will want to help when you're on
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it safe: Pick a spot where there's lots of bank to
maneuver. A kid just isn't going to have a good time if he or she
is confined to a small space.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it live: Kids love live-bait fishing because, well, things
like worms are squishy and gooey.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it slow: Kids will want to reel fast - way too fast to
effectively catch fish. So teach them to reel slowly. One method:
Cast, count to 3, let the lure sink, reel; cast, count to 4 and so
on. That will keep them focused and, when a fish strikes, you and
the child will know how deep.
</P>
<P>
   Keep spares: Assume you and your child are going to get wet. You
can prevent a ruined trip with a change of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your perspective: If you litter, if you take more than your
limit, if you encroach on others' fishing spots, that's exactly
what you will teach the youngster to do.

 EXCERPTS FROM McCAIN'S REMARKS ON CONFEDERATE FLAG  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbia, S.C. _ Following are excerpts from a speech by Sen.
John McCain on Wednesday in which he apologized for not having
denounced the flying of the Confederate battle flag atop the state
Capitol, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I made several mistakes in my campaign. I regret them, but I can
live with their consequences because I believe them to have been
simple errors in judgment and not an unprincipled act. Only once, I
believe, did I act in an unprincipled way. But once is enough, and
I want to tell the people of South Carolina and all Americans that
I sincerely regret breaking my promise to always tell you the
truth. ...
</P>
<P>
   My ancestors fought for the Confederacy, and I am sure that
many, maybe all of them, fought with courage and with faith that
they were serving a cause greater than themselves. But I don't
believe their service, however distinguished, needs to be
commemorated in a way that offends, that deeply hurts, people whose
ancestors were once denied their freedom by my ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those ancestors of mine might have fought honorably, they might
have fought to uphold a principle they believed was just. But they
fought to sever the union of our great nation, a cause that would
have terribly harmed America, perhaps irreparably, and, for a time
at least, perpetuated the grave injustice of slavery. They fought
on the wrong side of American history. That, my friends, is how I
personally feel about the Confederate battle flag. That is the
honest answer I never gave to a fair question. . . .
</P>
<P>
   As I admitted, I should have done this earlier, when an honest
answer could have affected me personally. I did not do so for one
reason alone. I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win
the South Carolina primary. So, I chose to compromise my
principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth. ...
</P>
<P>
   I do not intend for this apology to help me evade criticism for
my failure. I will be criticized by all sides for my late act of
contrition. I accept it, all of it. I deserve it. Honesty is easy
after the fact, when my own interests are no longer involved. I
don't seek absolution. Like anyone else, I can only try to resist
future temptations to abandon principle for expediency, and hope
that in the end, my character is judged from the totality of my
life, and not by its flaws alone.

KNICKS MUST ADJUST TO NEW PLAYOFF RHYTHM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the past, the game film junkie in Jeff Van Gundy
thrived on the pattern of the first-round playoff series. Until
this season, coaches like Van Gundy could retreat with their teams
to a minicamp, spend five days putting their opponents through a
time-lapse breakdown and inspect their every tick before Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   After the blueprints were finished, the series would unfold in
games played about every other day. There was a rhythm to the
spacing of the games, an even tempo fans could latch onto easily.
</P>
<P>
   This season, that groove is being disrupted by a television
schedule that will begin the best-of-5 first-round series this
weekend on three- to four-days' notice. The schedule will include
gaps between games that could reach three days and stretch the
series over 13 days. The New York Knicks were expected to play Game
1 against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the four-day break because I thought it was good for
the buildup to the games _ or series _ for everybody,'' Van Gundy
said before his team's practically meaningless season finale, a
112-85 loss to the Boston Celtics, at the Fleet Center on Wednesday
night. ``Again, it's understandable why they're doing it. They're
trying to boost TV ratings. We all benefit from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new schedule was part of a plan by Turner Sports to grab
higher ratings for TNT and TBS. Television executives said the new
strategy would eliminate doubleheaders that put the cable networks
in competition with each other. But with games spaced so far apart,
there is a chance that fans who have short attention spans will
miss the drama that used to build between tightly scheduled games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a little slippage,'' Van Gundy said. ``I
don't know about momentum from the teams, but in the interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the series begins between the third-seeded Knicks and the
sixth-seeded Raptors, there will be a challenge for players to keep
fresh. Historically, Patrick Ewing has been particularly
ineffective on three days' rest. On five such occasions this
season, Ewing has shot 37 percent in games after he has had too
much time to lose his rhythm. Latrell Sprewell has seen a similar
drop in his productivity, shooting 39 percent with three or more
days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series begins, the Knicks will be pressed for time.
In two days, Van Gundy must devise a strategy to dilute the impact
Vince Carter has had on the Knicks this season. In four games,
three of which ended in double-digit victories for the Raptors,
Carter averaged 32 points and shot 60.2 percent against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For ourselves, being the team who will have to do most of the
adjusting, the more time we have the better off it is,'' Van Gundy
said. ``But you know what? We're just going to have to play well.
And I believe we will play well.''
</P>
<P>
   All season, Van Gundy has played musical chairs with his
defenders, alternating his Carter coverage with Sprewell, Larry
Johnson and Marcus Camby. With a little game film, Van Gundy will
try to come up with another solution.
</P>
<P>
   If he does find the golden answer, there could be another
scheduling glitch to face. For any team that happens to sweep its
first-round opponent, the players could be sitting around for a
week while their next opponent finishes its series.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like an unlikely situation for the Knicks to deal with
considering their daunting opponent. With Thursday off, the task
for Van Gundy and his staff to prepare the Knicks will begin on
Friday with practices twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ideal,'' Van Gundy said. ``But that's the
way it is. It's for the benefit of TV. Whatever the schedule is,
that's how we have to play. We'd like to have more time on the
front part, but that's not how it is.''  &QL;

JEFF GORDON DESERVES A ROUSING ROUND OF CHEERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years on the receiving end of a relentless chorus of boos
has taught Jeff Gordon one thing.
</P>
<P>
   You were right, NASCAR fans.
</P>
<P>
   He deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody likes a winner,'' Gordon said Sunday at
Talladega Superspeedway, ``but nobody likes somebody that wins too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   That self-effacing observation was delivered on the occasion of
Gordon's landmark 50th career Winston Cup victory. Equally
important, Gordon's run to the checkered flag in the DieHard 500
broke a 13-race winless streak that began on Oct. 11 and matched
the longest drought of his Cup tenure.
</P>
<P>
   For new crew chief Robbie Loomis and the revamped ``Rainbow
Warriors'' pit crew, the non-winning streak stood at only eight as
they lined up for the second restrictor plate race of 2000.
Qualifying did little to indicate that Sunday would mark Gordon's
triumphant return, as he started 36th in the 43-car field. A former
three-time series champion, Gordon stood a so-what 12th in points
on Sunday morning after finally scoring his first top-five finish
(fourth) of 2000 at Martinsville Speedway a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Boo this Jeff Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   Made about as much sense as booing Robby Gordon. Or Michael
Waltrip. Or Ricky Craven.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? Because this certainly wasn't the same Gordon who
won a record-tying 13 Cup races and his third championship in 1998,
with crew chief Ray Evernham calling the shots from high atop Mount
Sinai. Nor apparently was it the same Gordon who won a mere seven
races in 1999, the last two with Brian Whitesell running the team
as Evernham's hand-picked replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Boo Gordon when he's down? Where's the sport in that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says it's much easier at the top,'' said Gordon,
whose nose dive began when he failed to finish higher than 10th
during the final five races of 1999. ``Sometimes that's true, but a
lot of people try to tear you down when you're at the top. I can
tell you when you get knocked down a notch, it's very tough. And I
think you just earn a little more respect, especially in this
garage area and from the fans, when you're not winning and you
slide some wins in there.''
</P>
<P>
   As the victories piled up from 1995 to 1999 and the boos
proliferated, Gordon seemed immune _ smiling and waving through
every catcall. His demeanor did not go unnoticed in the garage
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered why they were booing him, because it wasn't
like Jeff had ever done anything to anyone,'' said Dale Jarrett,
the popular and reigning Cup champion. ``He was just doing his job.
He was in a very enviable position ... because we would have all
liked to have had that opportunity to dominate like that.''
</P>
<P>
   True. True. But Gordon heard you, NASCAR fans.
</P>
<P>
   And you were right.
</P>
<P>
   He deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the boos started coming, I'd sit back and say, `I don't
blame 'em,' '' said Gordon, who denied Mike Skinner of his first
Cup victory by approximately two car-lengths at Talladega. ``You
win 13 races in a season or 10 races in a season and it's unheard
of ... and I was just as baffled with it myself as other people
were. I was sitting there being one of these fans, sitting out here
in the grandstands and knowing exactly why at times they'd pull
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was especially true during 1998, when Gordon tied NASCAR
legend Richard Petty's single-season victory mark of 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I took them \Rvictories\S for granted,'' said
Gordon, synonymous with the No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``I think the whole time we knew how special of a season we were
having, but I've got to be honest with you. When you pull into
Victory Lane the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th time, it's not the same
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it the same feeling that Gordon, Loomis and team manager
Whitesell experienced on Sunday, when they raised themselves out of
mediocrity as the season's record-setting ninth different winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that just one win is going to turn things
around for us, but I think it's definitely going to be a boost,''
said Gordon, anticipating the tour's visit to the California
Speedway on April 30. ``I think this has been a great test for all
of us. It's really been a test for our faith in one another, our
faith in God, and I think we've done good up against this test.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for a round of cheers.
</P>
<P>
   So give it up, NASCAR fans.
</P>
<P>
   He deserves it.
Indy-car team quickly regroups after tragedy
</P>
<P>
   When Robby McGehee joined Treadway Racing for the 2000 Indy-car
season, he did so as teammate and understudy to Sam Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   But the crash in practice in January that left Schmidt paralyzed
has changed all that. McGehee, 26, now occupies the No. 1 seat on a
team that is capable of winning the season's next two races _ at
Las Vegas and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Treadway Racing has, in fact, won the last two Indy Racing
Northern Light Series events run at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, site
of Saturday's Vegas Indy 300. Schmidt scored his first series
victory at his home track last September, thrusting himself into
the thick of a championship chase that ultimately was won by
Plano's Greg Ray at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, two-time Indy 500 champion Arie Luyendyk
notched the final victory of his career on the 1.5-mile trioval.
Luyendyk last drove for car owner Fred Treadway at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway in May, where an accident while in the lead cheated
the Dutchman out of his dream of retiring as a three-time Indy 500
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that same race saw McGehee _ in his series debut _
finish fifth for Conti Racing en route to being chosen Rookie of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Schmidt nor McGehee combined could equal the savvy
brought to the team by Luyendyk, they loomed as a young, aggressive
and articulate combination. But Schmidt's crash at Homestead-Miami
Speedway changed all that, for McGehee and crew chief Skip Faul.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with Sam ... we don't have to talk about how bad
that is,'' said McGehee, who has nine series races on his resume.
``I raced with Sam in 1996 in Formula 2000. He's had more years in
Indy-car, but our overall experience is similar. I was looking
forward to working with Sam because I knew him and he always gave
me great advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it \Rthe crash\S makes every race car driver
reconsider what they're doing for a living, and do I want to do
this as a career? But the passion is still there. He had the same
passion I have. We have to chug along with Sam on the sidelines and
pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   McGehee said he spent the first two races of 2000 adjusting to
the fact that his No. 5 Mall.com/Energizer G Force-Aurora is a car
that can keep going and going.
</P>
<P>
   Faul, Luyendyk's longtime chief wrench, said he and Schmidt went
through a similar learning curve during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about this time that it started to click,'' Faul said.
``So the honeymoon is over and Robby knows what he's got to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely got the ambition and aggressiveness to be a
good race car driver. We've got to channel it a little bit. But we
know he's got good car control, and gives good chassis setup
information. And when he gets in the race, he's a go-getter. Those
add up to being a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:FRACTION ALERT \Nsubheds:Plate remains in place
NASCAR's one-day aerodynamic experiment at the Talladega
Superspeedway on Monday came wrapped with this disclaimer:
carburetor restrictor plates never came off the two cars tested.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Chevrolet Monte Carlo provided by Richard Childress
Racing and a Ford Taurus from Roush Racing, NASCAR officials tried
a number of aero tweaks to slow the cars down via downforce.
Changes included using a 65-degree rear spoiler, raising the front
valance from 31/2 inches to 6 inches, and adding a 1-inch wicker
bill to the roofs near the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, the Winston Cup Series director, reiterated that
the plates remained in place during the approximately 50 laps run.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some of the things we tried,'' Nelson said, ``we were
able to increase them \Rplates\S a quarter-inch more than what we
had during Sunday's race at Talladega.'' Cars ran the DieHard 500
with a seven-eighths-inch restrictor plate for the first time this
season. \Nsubheds:NHRA five-for-five NASCAR's Winston Cup Series
has produced a record nine different winners in as many races this
season.
</P>
<P>
   A similar scenario is playing out in the National Hot Rod
Association's Top Fuel ranks. The first five national events have
produced five different winners: Gary Scelzi (Pomona), Tony
Schumacher (Phoenix), Doug Kalitta (Gainesville), Kenny Bernstein
(Las Vegas) and Larry Dixon (Baytown).
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, the reigning champion, has forged a 66-point lead
over two-time champion Scelzi with a run of consistency. Schumacher
has advanced to four finals in five starts in the Exide Batteries
Dragster, missing out only at The Strip at Las Vegas.
\Nsubheds:Tracy off, running With top-three finishes in the first
two races of 2000, perennial CART bad-boy Paul Tracy is enjoying
the fastest start of his 10-year FedEx Championship Series career.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, of Team Kool Green, finished third in the season-opener
at Homestead, Fla., and posted his 16th career victory in the Long
Beach Grand Prix last Sunday. In seven previous years as a
full-season Championship Auto Racing Teams competitor, Tracy never
had posted back-to-back scoring finishes in his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy has an eight-point championship lead (34-26) over Jimmy
Vasser of Target/Chip Ganassi Racing heading into the Rio 200 at
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on April 30. It is the first time the
Canadian has led the points chase since 1997. \Nsubheds:TMS

STARTING PITCHING GIVING RANGERS A CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rick Helling has a simple credo, sort of a
starting pitcher's mantra, that he takes to the mound with him for
every outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is give the team a chance to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did his part against the New York Yankees yesterday at The
Ballpark in Arlington, surrendering two runs on seven hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, didn't win. They were beaten yet again by
the New York Yankees, this time, 5-4, in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   They lost for the fourth consecutive game, beginning Sunday in
Cleveland and continuing with a three-game sweep by the Yankees at
home.
</P>
<P>
   But in three of the four games the starting pitcher accomplished
the basic goal, giving the team a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   The starters' earned-run average in the four games was 3.10.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza pitched 71/3 shutout innings against the Indians
on Sunday, but the Rangers lost, 2-1, when closer John Wetteland
gave up two homers in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver allowed two runs in eight innings against the
Yankees on Monday, a game the Rangers lost in 11 innings, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   And Helling pitched effectively yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The worst outing in the four games was by Kenny Rogers, who
struggled against the Yankees on Tuesday, allowing six runs on nine
hits. But at least he was able to work into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of the intent of the off-season, to strengthen
our rotation and take some wear and tear off the bullpen,'' Helling
said. ``It's an indication of what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   That indeed was the idea when the Rangers signed Rogers and
Oliver as free agents and traded for Justin Thompson, who is
scheduled to make a rehabilitation start tonight at Double-A Tulsa
and could be close to joining the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that our starting pitching was going to be a strength,
and it should get even stronger with Justin Thompson coming back,''
manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   It's something new for a Rangers team.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a four-game losing streak occurs when the starting
pitchers get hammered and the offense can't keep up. This one
happened because the hitters didn't do enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying our pitching will carry us early, and it
shows,'' Rangers first baseman-designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
said. ``We had a chance to win every game. If we execute
offensively, we win.''

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Crossing the tram tracks that cut the cobbled
streets, and traversing the iron and glass arcaded gallerias that
canopy the 19th-century shopping arcades like grand hotel palms, a
visitor to Milan and its annual furniture fair encountered an
unsettling fact: that the 20th century is now the past, too.
</P>
<P>
   The future has arrived. But have we? Is a candy-striped plastic
chair what we have to show for the last 1,000 years?
</P>
<P>
   At the 2-million-square-foot Salone, the world's largest
exhibition for contemporary design, as well as at two large tandem
events and 320 gallery shows taking place simultaneously in the
city designers ignored the future, embraced the future or, in a few
select instances, took a sledgehammer to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch partnership Do Create, in collaboration with Droog
Design, showed a steel cube that the buyer bashes into a cove of a
chair in a kind of vicious do-it-yourself: consumer frustration
with existing choice as a tool for change. The sledgehammer comes
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening everywhere now, what's interesting, is the
whole crossover of media _ sound, film, theater, art, furniture,''
said the artist Robert Wilson, whose installation ``Anna's Room''
was part of an exhibition of meditations on interiors by artists.
``I had a retrospective at the Centre Pompidou 10 years ago, and I
worked with all the departments _ architecture and design, painting
and sculpture, audio and video. Times have changed. It's all
incredibly mixed now.''
</P>
<P>
   The British artist Rachel Whiteread, who was included in the
Brooklyn Museum's ``Sensation'' show, exhibited an upholstered
daybed, her first, for the English retailer SCP Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   There was the stylish status quo: Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec,
two brothers from Brittany, introduced a wafer-thin lounge chair
upholstered in felt with a spring-loaded attached ottoman that
would be easy to see in psychiatrists' offices during the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   But the true prototypes proposed not new materials or shapes,
but models for environments, from the technological to the ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in making new typologies of furnishing,'' said
Matali Crasset, a French designer who exhibited plaid plastic
shopping bags, popular in immigrant neighborhoods in Paris, foam
filled to make cheap, versatile tables and chairs. ``Why not take
the objects around with you, and make your own proposals for
design?'' Crasset said. (The Italian company Edra, which
commissioned them, will sell them, complete with handles.)
</P>
<P>
   Snowcrash, a young Finnish company, showed
voice-and-music-activated wall and ceiling lighting in flat panels
and soft clouds that permit a space to interact in a conversational
style with its inhabitants by modulating its colors and forms.
Andreas Murray, the president of Snowcrash, said he thought high
technologies like LED display, which are now inexpensive, and young
consumers' comfort with computers would help shift the design of
homes from traditional furniture to mood-responsive atmospheres for
work or play: a kind of functional fun.
</P>
<P>
   Other young designers lowered their sights to the floor with
lamps that rested like pets, yoga-mat rugs and legless inner-tube
seating. Like furniture afloat, they freed the constraints of space
by disregarding walls. At Alterpoint, an exhibition in the city,
Anthony Tammaro, 29, an American student at Domus Academy in Milan,
showed latex, rubber and plastic lamps that he said were designed
``to curl up next to, with a book.'' The lamps look like portable
fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Lindfors, 37, a Finnish designer whose Housemix
exhibition included a soup-to-nuts range of domestic solutions,
from architecture to toothpaste, said he thought designers had a
renewed responsibility to ``the everyday.'' Lindfors' Qubico house
was erected in less than a week, developed by a Finnish company
that manufactures modular wood ``timbers'' integrating wiring and
plumbing. Lindfors' Abaqus stacking chair is recyclable: both
plywood and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeru Uchida, a Japanese designer, presented simple wooden
wall cabinets with sliding lacquered-metal doors that involved the
user in a small ceremony of poetic display as with the shoji
screens of a traditional Japanese teahouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 20 century depended on machinery and mass production,''
Uchida said. ``In the 21st century, designers should realize things
more basic to our life styles. We need to focus on spirit _
interiors that can release the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The future, at its brashest, showed up at the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donatella Versace! Donatella Versace!'' wailed the young man
with the brunet bowl-of-noodles hair as he staggered out of the
Ford Motor Co. party at Fendi, struck by his celebrity sighting. He
collapsed in the street at midnight. It was like the last five
minutes of a Verdi opera.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ex-factory, several thousand guests from around the
globe pushed and posed, drinking shots of straight liquor served in
test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   At the eye of the cyclone, like the revolving vortex of a drain,
was a huge turntable rotating a bright bug-green automobile: the
O21C, Ford's Jetsons-like prototype for pushing Generation Ys pedal
to the metal. Marc Newson, the shag-haired New Zealand designer who
designed it, rode the turntable with his creation. Wearing a
multicolored, party-animal-skin frock coat, he cavorted for
television cameras with a woman in fake diamond cuffs, satin
hip-hugger trousers and Telly Savalas-style gold Gucci aviator
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe we're here to see a car,'' said a redhead in
Prada to a redhead in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, watching Newson swing by.
</P>
<P>
   Design is the new corporate club drug, being used to sell
excitement in products _ fruit-gel laptops, titanium snowboards,
single-malt Scotches in Swedish jiggers _ to the young, affluent
and advertised-to.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. ``Design is the DNA for a whole group of people who
want to live a type of lifestyle, and see it mirrored in everything
they own,'' said Jay Mays, the vice president of design at Ford,
who hired Newson. The O21C, a kind of super-model T, has yet to get
the green light for manufacture, though ``what was an extremely
weird car a year ago,'' Mays added, ``looks pretty mainstream
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which left the 39-year-old April trade event in a desperate
disco sweat. It smelled like middle-aged panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milan's gotten too big for it's own good,'' said Tom Dixon, a
designer and ex-outsider, who is now directing the design program
at the Habitat chain. Dixon walked into the party for G7, a New
York group sponsored by Totem, where martinis and champagne were
being served, wearing a matted mock-teddy-bear-fur coat to keep his
rebel credentials on view. ``If you had seen this stuff in
isolation in Prague, you'd go `Oh, wow,'' he said, speaking of the
deadness induced by Milan's scale.
</P>
<P>
   Two women circled a violet plastic inflatable lounge chair, as a
man seated in it tipped over to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you don't want to get too close to
with a cigarette,'' the woman who was smoking said, raising her
glass.
</P>
<P>
   For young designers and young companies eager for corporate
matchmaking, is Milan still the best place to be looking for love?
</P>
<P>
   ``Milan was, is, and will always be the center of design,'' said
Philippe Starck, the French designer, at a press breakfast with his
new wife. ``Is Hollywood the place for the movies?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But to a world quickened and acquainted by the Internet, is that
increasingly irrelevant?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, absolutely,'' said Murray of Snowcrash, who is gunning
for contracts with Apple and its universal iMac audience, not the
traditional design cognoscenti whose taste and trends are
established by Italian showrooms like Cappellini. ``Why produce our
things as they did in the 1950s, when we live in the 21st century?
Beautiful things that communicate with who? Ten thousand, 50,000
people in the world? It's nice to be here, looking at what others
are doing, but for us, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas
would be a better place for our next exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Engesvik, 29, showing with Norway Says, a Finnish
collective, at the Salone Satellite, an exhibition of experimental
design, said, ``We're young and we're big-mouthed, but we have to
be that.'' He had found generational similarities, not national
disparities, with other young designers from as far as Singapore
and Tokyo. ``Our thoughts are so similar, when it comes to what
design is about,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Engesvik designed a briefcase-like, wall-mounted desk that
attracted the attention of Raymond Kennedy, general manager for
Herman Miller for the Home. ``Design for the last two or three
decades has been so excluding, and so expensive,'' Engesvik said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``designing products that are easy to produce,
that don't require expensive new tools'' was the real problem on
the drawing board, not creating new styles. And, he said,
accessibility to design must improve. ``It's very popular to talk
about the Web, but existing structures are not flexible, or dynamic
enough,'' Engesvik said. ``Every young designer I've talked to
wants to make the leap, out of the existing system.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, will give the parties?

DESPITE CHANGES, NEW YORK BALLOT OBSTACLES PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ While state lawmakers may sweep away New York's
notoriously tough rules for letting candidates onto Republican
presidential primary ballots, state law still puts an array of
obstacles in the way of people who would run for lesser offices, in
any party.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators and good-government groups say it is still far
too difficult for insurgent candidates, without the backing of
party organizations, to go through the painstaking process of
gathering the signatures needed to get on primary ballots for
statewide office or for seats in Congress and the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incumbency protection system,'' said Rachel Leon,
executive director of the New York state branch of Common Cause.
``The problem now is that we have party bosses still in charge,
instead of voters, in deciding who gets to run for office in this
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature changed the rules in
1996, eliminating some of the law's most picayune requirements,
like a provision that demanded that each petition list each
signer's Assembly district and local election district number _
information that few people know. Critics say those changes were
laudable but did not go far enough. The number of candidates whose
petitions are challenged in court by their opponents has not
declined since that change.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Republican-led state Senate approved a bill,
proposed by the Republican governor, that would allow major
candidates to get on a Republican presidential primary ballot
automatically, much like the rules for Democratic presidential
primaries. The Democratic leaders of the Assembly have not said
what they will do with the bill, but they are not expected to stand
in the way of the Republicans' changing their own system.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other Republican leaders embraced the change
after their efforts to keep Sen. John McCain off the March 7
presidential primary ballot backfired. The episode proved
politically damaging for the state's top Republicans, who were seen
as unfairly manipulating the process, and in the end, a federal
judge ordered that McCain be allowed on the ballot. He lost the
primary to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed changes do not affect any contests except
Republican presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   For primaries for statewide offices like governor or U.S.
senator, candidates can get on the ballot with the support of 25
percent of the delegates at a state party convention. In recent
years, Democratic Party leaders have stretched the rules to help
all serious candidates reach 25 percent, but the Republicans have
occasionally used the rule to knock out people who would challenge
the party favorite.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide candidate who does not get 25 percent support from a
convention can still get on the Republican or Democratic primary
ballot by gathering at least 15,000 signatures of voters registered
in that party over a six-week period, including at least 100 in
each of 16 of the state's congressional districts. For minor-party
candidates, the law requires the signatures of 5 percent of their
party's registered voters statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for congressional or legislative seats have no choice
but to go the petition route. Major-party candidates for Congress
must gather 1,250 signatures from voters in their parties and in
their districts, candidates for state Senate need 1,000, and
candidates for the Assembly need 500. Minor-party candidates need 5
percent of their party's voters in that district.
</P>
<P>
   The signature requirements mean a candidate needs a large team
of people doing the collecting _ an easy thing for an incumbent or
someone with the backing of the party machinery, but hard for an
outsider. And there is a daunting set of rules by which the
signatures must be collected, including one that requires that
voters list their addresses by city or town, not by the villages or
postal zones that they might normally use.
</P>
<P>
   Each party has at its disposal a cadre of lawyers who are expert
at going to court to challenge signatures, or even whole petitions.
Candidates routinely collect three times as many signatures as are
legally required, to ward off such challenges.

BLACKJACK SOFTWARE MAY EVEN THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In casinos, the house has the advantage. If you don't believe
it, look around. They didn't build palaces like these by giving
away free drinks and big jackpots all the time, but by grinding
down players little by little.
</P>
<P>
   But at some games, the players have a slightly better advantage
of winning, or _ for the gambling realists _ not losing as much.
When bets are placed correctly, the house has only a slight edge at
the craps table. And blackjack tables offer a fairly level playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackjack 6-7-8'' is a program that seeks to help players make
that field even more level. The program, which costs about $60 and
is for Windows, is the outgrowth of Hal Marcus' 1971 visit to Las
Vegas. It was a trip to the bookstore _ rather than a blackjack
table _ that really started Marcus, a computer programmer, on his
way to eventually cofounding Stickysoft Corp. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On that trip, Marcus purchased Edward O. Thorp's ``Beat the
Dealer,'' a blackjack system developed by a mathematics professor
at the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Marcus learned that players could do better at the
blackjack tables if they would follow certain betting strategies _
some of which seemed to run against common sense. For instance,
Thorp's strategy is to double the bet when the player has an
ace-seven showing and the dealer has a three.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Marcus purchased his first personal computer, and four
years later wrote a blackjack program to test various strategies.
Although the program was graphically crude by today's standards, he
found people who played it were fascinated by it. He also found
that most of the people who played it made decisions based on
hunches.
</P>
<P>
   And thus ``Blackjack 6-7-8'' was born. It allows players to play
at a blackjack table just like in a casino. However, it can also be
told to provide hints during game play and teach players to make
the proper decisions that will give them an edge over the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one plays alone at a blackjack table, the computer will
supply up to six computer controlled players to play, using one to
25 decks, with rules that can be customized to fit any casino in
the world. The human player can also control the actions of some or
all of the other players at the table rather than letting the
computer do the work.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure the program can really help improve your
blackjack game, put your theory to the test: Set up the computer
players to use various strategies, then run simulated hands _ up to
2 billion of them _ to find out how the systems worked.
</P>
<P>
   While users play their hands, the program tracks how many
decisions were made correctly and helps players find where they may
be able to beat the dealer by acting differently given the same set
of cards.
</P>
<P>
   A training section allows players to concentrate on specific
hands. There are no other players, and the hands aren't finished _
only the choices count. That way, players can train in an area of
weakness, go to the playing area, then track their decisions to see
if they've improved.
</P>
<P>
   The program teaches betting strategy as well as playing strategy
and can be set to alert the player if either of those strategies is
violated during play. For players who want to try counting cards,
the program can display a running count and true count as well as
the number of cards left in the shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Nice features, good graphics, simple play and sophisticated
teaching make this a top-notch piece of simulation software.
</P>

<P>
   PARIS _ The question has intrigued historians for 200 years. Was
the disease-riddled little boy who died in 1795 after years alone
in a prison cell really the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette?
</P>
<P>
   Or had royalists managed, at the height of the French
Revolution, to spirit the young heir from harm after his parents
were sent to the guillotine?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, two scientists said they could offer proof that the
10-year-old was indeed Louis XVII. He had endured two years in
Temple prison, where he was left unattended and in the dark for
long stretches, with skin tumors, scabies and increasing signs of
madness.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, after examining all that remains of the boy _ a
dried heart _ said they had been able to match the boy's DNA with
that of other members of the royal family, including DNA taken from
a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of 200 years of uncertainty,'' said Philippe
Delorme, a historian who had pressed for the test and helped
announced the results. ``It is a very exciting day for historians.
It puts to an end a mystery that has absorbed so many of us. Now we
have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, more than 500 books have been written about
the young dauphin, and many theories emerged about his possible
escape and presumed exile.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mark Twain could not resist tweaking the issue. In ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' Huck tells Tom about ``the little
boy dolphin'' who might have been king but was shut up in jail and
may have died there, though others said the boy might have gotten
away to America. In 1905, speculation on the subject was so intense
that a monthly review was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the young prince's death, rumors circulated that
he had been spirited out in a bathtub and that the dead boy was a
substitute. Would-be heirs have popped up all over Europe claiming
to be the true descendants of the Bourbon line.
</P>
<P>
   One such man, Charles-Guillaume Naundorff, was so convincing
that the government of the Netherlands allowed him to be buried
there in 1845 under a tombstone indicating he was the true heir to
the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the royal family say dozens more claim to be direct
descendants, though few have been as public with their claims.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the scientists said they were all impostors. They
said they had been able to extract three samples of mitochondrial
DNA from the heart and compare them with samples from locks of hair
taken from Marie Antoinette, two of her sisters and samples from
two living maternal relatives, Queen Anna of Romania and her
brother Andre. In all cases, they said, they had found
``identical'' sequences.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, both specialists in human genetics, Jean-Jacques
Cassiman of the University of Louvain in Belgium and Bernd
Brinkmann of the University of Muenster in Germany, said they had
found enough matching DNA to determine that Marie Antoinette was
the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new evidence will end all conspiracy theories in the
rarified world of royal intrigue remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the news conference announcing the results, some members
of the audience questioned whether the scientists could be
considered truly independent, given that they were paid by the
royal family trust. Others speculated whether the dead boy might
not have been another son of Marie Antoinette that no one knew
about.
</P>
<P>
   But royal-gazing does not really interest the French much. The
French Revolution and its many aftershocks wiped out a great many
members of the royal family and stripped most of their wealth.
Since the last reigning king, Louis-Philippe, was removed from
office in the revolution of 1848, there has been much feuding over
who is the real heir to the throne, but very little effort to
restore anyone to it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, the duke of Beauffremont, who heads the Memorial
of France at St.-Denis, the private organization that oversees the
royal graves and paid for the DNA tests, said that he was grateful
that science had provided an answer and that he would now push for
a proper burial for the boy's remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see him placed between his mother and his
father, which would be very fitting,'' the duke said. He said last
December that he had decided to have the heart tested because the
question of the boy's death just would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman was at first unsure that any DNA testing could be
accomplished because the heart was in such bad shape. The story of
how it survived is a crazy saga that can hardly be a scientist's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   It was never meant to be preserved. But one of the doctors
present at the child's autopsy decided to keep it as a memento. The
doctor, Philippe-Jean Pelletan, stole it and wrapped it in his
handkerchief when no one was looking. At home, he put it in a glass
vial filled with alcohol, but the liquid evaporated and the heart
dried up, hard as a stone. A few years later, one of the doctor's
assistants stole it. When he died, his widow returned it to the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the monarchy was briefly returned to power in 1815,
the doctor apparently tried to return the heart to Louis XVIII, who
wanted nothing to do with it. So, just before Pelletan died, he
decided to entrust it to the archbishop of Paris. But in 1831 the
archbishop's palace came under attack during civil disorders, and a
printer named Lescroart tried to save the relic and the paperwork
that proved its authenticity in the hopes of giving it back to the
doctor's son for safekeeping. But he got caught in the mayhem, and
as he wrestled with a national guardsman, the crystal urn
containing the heart was smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, when all was quiet, Lescroart came back with
Pelletan's son and they found the heart lying among shards of
glass, some engraved with royal fleurs-de-lis. The son kept the
heart until his death. In his will, he bequeathed it to members of
one of the branches of France's royal family, who kept it in their
chateau for more than eight decades. In 1975, it was put into the
custody of the Memorial for France at St.-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their doubts, both Cassiman and Brinkmann were able
to get an adequate sample of DNA by cutting tiny slices from the
heart with razor blades. The DNA samples were not perfect, both
scientists said, but they were complete enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman has tried before to answer royal mysteries. In 1998, he
tried to compare the DNA from Naundorff to that from Marie
Antoinette's hair and her sister's hair found in a locket belonging
to their mother. In his findings in the European Journal of Human
Genetics, he said it was highly unlikely Naundorff was related to
the young queen, whose Austrian blood line and fancy ways helped
ignite the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Delorme, who has written two books on the young prince's life,
said the DNA results were a form of justice for the child. ``Until
now, his death was stolen,'' he said. ``It was not admitted that he
died in such a horrible way.''

WHITE HOUSE APPEARS TO HESITATE ON DAM-BREACHING ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Clinton administration appears to be ducking the
most contentious issue in the salmon-rescue debate _ dam breaching
_ until after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to restore Southeast Washington's Snake
River by disabling four dams ``will not _ and should not _ be made
on my watch,'' Clinton's Interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, told
Washington Sen. Slade Gorton earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the National Marine Fisheries Service said it
will not make a recommendation in late spring, as previously
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a high-ranking Army Corps of Engineers official said
in congressional testimony last week that postponing a decision on
the dams until after the election ``is a distinct possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Corps spokeswoman promised a tentative
recommendation ``in the October-November time frame,'' leaving
enough wiggle room that the announcement could come after Vice
President Al Gore faces Texas George W. Bush on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers was to show the Clinton administration's
hand last December, but the agency unexpectedly balked and made no
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, The Washington Times reported that the Corps had
been prepared to recommend leaving the dams in place, but senior
officials in the Department of Defense ordered that recommendation
erased. A Senate task force has begun an investigation, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's greatly disturbing,'' said Gorton spokeswoman Cynthia
Bergman, who accused the administration of ``suppressing scientific
evidence to further their political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 22 memorandum obtained by the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, Joseph Westphal, assistant secretary of the
Army, decreed that ``The Army does not at this time have a
preferred alternative'' on dam-breaching. He ordered two chapters
of the corps' draft recommendation removed.
</P>
<P>
   The four dams on the lower Snake turned what was once a
free-flowing, cool river into a series of warm, somewhat stagnant
ponds, thus killing salmon as they migrate to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But the dams bring economic benefits: low-cost transportation to
market for goods such as wheat and timber products and about 5
percent of the Northwest's electricity. One dam provides water for
13 farms.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams _ punching holes in their earthen flanks to
allow the river to flow freely _ would make the river too shallow
for barges. More-expensive truck or railroads would be required.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, Indian tribes, and sport and commercial
fishermen are virtually unanimous in calling for the dams' demise.
Lining up in the dams' defense are agriculture interests, most
Southeast Washington residents and high-ranking Northwest
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging picture of the administration's handling of this
critical decision is one of disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand
is doing,'' said Chris Zimmer of Save Our Wild Salmon, an
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Although a cost-benefit analysis apparently swayed the Corps
away from dam-breaching, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regional
administrator called breaching ``a no-brainer'' when biology is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   And a third agency involved, the National Marine Fisheries
Service, has abandoned plans to issue a recommendation in May or
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely we would make a decision this year,''
said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the fisheries service. ``We
simply don't have enough science.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had promised, as a result of a lawsuit
filed by environmentalists in the mid-1990s, to make a decision in
1999. Then the fisheries service planned a recommendation by late
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman compared federal scientists to emergency-room doctors. In
some cases, they face a patient so badly hurt they must make
instant decisions without waiting for diagnostic work such as blood
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in that situation now,'' he said. ``We have time to
let the patient recover enough so that when we do make our
decision, it's going to be the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet if the dams must be breached in order to
avoid extinction. ... There may be some other way, and it's too
risky a decision to make without knowing if there is another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, meanwhile, are getting a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administration officials I talked to bristled at the notion
that they are punting,'' said Scott Bosse of Idaho Rivers United.
Still, he said, ``This administration over the last 7{ years has
such a pitiful history of delaying any meaningful action that it's
hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough issue for Gore, who has been silent on the
dam-breaching issue. Gore has presented himself as the
administration's leading environmentalist, but he needs the labor
vote to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Labor solidly backs the dams. And the Washington State Labor
Council, AFL-CIO, represents about 460,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this divide between two core constituencies, Gore
apparently has decided not to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's got the nomination without taking this position,'' said
Bruce Lovelin of the Columbia River Alliance, which represents
dam-dependent businesses. ``Why the hell's he going to take this
position now? He's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovelin said he wonders what might happen if Bush _ who is
foursquare against breaching _ triumphs in November. Might there be
a ``rush to judgment'' in the final days of a Clinton presidency?
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor could change in the election: Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's senior senator, the most powerful congressional
opponent of dam-breaching, has been targeted by Democrats, who view
him as vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gorton convenes what has been called a ``salmon
summit'' at the Redmond, Wash., VFW Hall, to hear from local and
state officials and tribal leaders on salmon-recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this week, Gorton made it clear he will not waiver
on the issue. ``As long as I'm a U.S. senator, no proposal to
breach Snake River dams will pass in Congress.''

COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: INTERNET CALLS MAY BE FREE, BUT THEY'RE NOT
AS  GOOD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: &LR;  I've heard that you can use your PC to make free &LR; 
 &LR; long-distance calls to any telephone. Is that true, and if so, &LR; 
 &LR; how can I do it? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: To quote Madeline Kahn from ``Blazing Saddles,'' ``It's twu!
It's twu!'' A company called Dialpad.com ( &LR; www.dialpad.com &LR; ) is
offering just such a service for calls in the United States. And
there's no software to download _ it's all done with Java over the
Internet. You can also use the market leader, Net2Phone, but it
will cost you 1 cent per minute and you'll have to download special
software. In either case, you'll need a headset with a microphone _
which you can pick up at a computer store for less than $30.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the caveat. Don't expect an Internet phone call to be as
good as a regular phone call. Even if you have a high-speed
connection, you're likely to experience at least a little latency _
a delay between the time someone says something at one end and it's
heard at the other. That can be disconcerting enough to make you go
back to your phone. But you know what they say _ you get what you
pay for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Expanding the Cell
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Is there a way to enter text in an Excel cell without the type
spilling past the right border of the cell in one long line?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Sure. Right-click the cell and choose Format Cells from the
context menu. Tab over to Alignment, and in the Text control
section, check the box labeled Wrap text. Then click OK. Any text
you enter in the cell will stay inside it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Video Memory
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My PC at home is unable to play some of the more
graphics-intensive CDs like the new Disney Toy Story 2 Action Game.
The reason I was given was my video card has only 2 megabytes of
memory, and the game requires 4Mb. Does this mean I need a new
video card? If so, where can I get one, and can I install it
myself? My system runs on a Pentium II chip and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Video memory is just like regular computer memory. Every time
you think you have enough, somebody comes up with software that
gobbles up more. Many of today's shoot-'em-up action games can use
16 megs of video memory or more. Now to your problem. You may have
a video card in your PC, or the video may be embedded on the
computer's motherboard. Either way, it may be possible to simply
add video memory, so the first thing to do is contact the PC-maker
about that.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not possible to upgrade the video you already have, then
it's time to buy a new 3-D card _ which you can easily install
yourself. Before you go shopping, though, open up your PC to make
sure there's a place to put the card. You'll need an open PCI or
AGP expansion slot. The PCI slots are the white ones, which all
newer PCs have. The AGP slot is smaller, usually black, and it's
located just above the PCI slots. You may or may not have an AGP
slot. If you do, get an AGP card, because the AGP slot is designed
for high-speed graphics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Automatic Reply
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I've seen an automatic reply forwarded to me when I e-mail
someone who's on vacation or out of the office. How do I get my
computer to do the same thing when someone e-mails me and I am away
on vacation? I have a small home office. I have Office 2000, but I
can't seem to find this on any of the pull downs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The automatic response you've been seeing is generated by the
mail server at the person's company. Since you don't have a mail
server of your own (you use your ISP's server), you can't do the
same thing from home.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a DSL line or cable modem, however, there's an
alternative option. Set up a mail ``rule'' in Outlook or Outlook
Express that will send an automatic reply (which you can create) to
every incoming message (you'll find the rules options in the Tools
menu of both programs).
</P>
<P>
   For this to work, you'll have to leave your computer on all the
time you're gone with the e-mail software running. The software
should already be set to check for new mail regularly. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  For users of the AOL /Netscape Instant Messenger: End your chat
session by pressing the Control key and the number 1. It will bring
a smile to the face of the person at the other end.

 HP REINVENTING THE PRINTING WORLD  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Continuing its yearlong campaign to reposition
itself as a hip Internet player, Hewlett-Packard on Wednesday
announced a series of alliances, appliances and initiatives
designed to transform the $40 billion desktop printing business
into a $100 billion ``Internet ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   That plan, Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina told a San
Francisco press briefing Wednesday, involves changing home and
office printers from ``simple beige boxes'' into ``information
appliances.'' Their value, she said, will be measured not by their
print speeds but by the services they deliver, such as printing
stamps and tickets, automatically generating customized newspapers
and outputting documents sent over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The network, Fiorina said, is bringing about a fundamental shift
across the printing industry. Today, documents are printed
centrally, then distributed in physical form. In the emerging
Internet age, they'll be distributed in electronic form, then
printed locally, in the recipient's home or office.
</P>
<P>
   To foster this transformation, she said, HP is working on
technologies that will enable users to print directly from devices
such as cell phones, pocket organizers, digital cameras and even
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   HP's stake in this transformation? Since it controls more than
half the worldwide market for desktop printers and supplies, it
stands to reap rich rewards as more printing shifts from
traditional commercial printing to the desktop. Fiorina said HP
holds the No. 1 position in every part of the printer business in
which it competes.
</P>
<P>
   While margins are increasingly tight on both laser and inkjet
printers, the market for ``consumables'' _ ink, toner cartridges
and paper _ remains ``enormously profitable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   HP also hopes to leverage its leadership in the printing market
into increased sales of servers, software and professional services
to companies providing print-related products and services.
</P>
<P>
   It announced new partnerships with several such startups,
including NewsPaperDirect, which helps hotels and cruise liners
offer their guests locally printed versions of newspapers from
around the world; Stamps.com and EncrypTix, sibling companies that
offer secure printing of documents such as tickets, stamps,
traveler's checks and gift certificates; printCafe, which auctions
and brokers commercial printing contracts; and ImageTag, which
attaches bar-coded stickers to companies' documents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Palo Alto, Calif.'s HP said it has made an equity
investment and taken a seat on the board of Mimeo.com, a New York
company that offers overnight printing and binding and guaranteed
delivery of documents sent over the Net to its facility in Memphis,
Tenn., adjoining FedEx's hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing really earth-shattering,'' said Jim Lundy,
Gartner Group research director, ``but it's a new strategy and a
good one.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more concrete announcements of the day, FedEx
announced a new version of its free interNetShip software that lets
users print their own shipping labels on HP inkjet printers.
Previously, the program required a laser printer.

 APPLE OUTSHINES ESTIMATES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Crediting strong sales of its professional
products and a continuing influx of new users for its iMac models,
Apple on Wednesday announced second-quarter results that handily
topped analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino, Calif., computer-maker's revenues for the three
months ended April 1 were $1.94 billion, up 27 percent from $1.53
million in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter totaled $233 million ($1.28 per
share). In the same period last year, earnings were $135 million
(84 cents). This year's figure, however, included a $73 million
after-tax gain (40 cents) from the sale of shares in ARM Holdings,
a British chip designer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Excluding the investment windfall, Apple earned $160 million
(88 cents). Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
forecast earnings of 81 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding nonrecurring items from net income for both this year
and last, earnings were up 72 percent in all and 47 percent on a
per-share basis.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose shares are up roughly tenfold since January
1998, also announced plans for a 2-for-1 stock split, its first in
13 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading before Apple released its results, the
company's shares fell $5.75, to $121.13. But in after-hours trading
after the announcement, the price jumped to as much as $127.81.
During the most-recent quarter, Apple said, it sold 1,043,000
computers, a year-over-year increase of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 were Power Mac G4s, the high-performance systems
the company markets mainly to graphics, publishing and multimedia
professionals, and 100,000 were PowerBooks, Apple's high-end
laptop, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said during a
conference call after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Non-U.S. sales accounted for 51 percent of revenues for the
quarter, Apple said. Gross margins climbed from 25.9 percent in the
first quarter to 28.2 percent. Anderson credited the increase to
lower freight charges (because the company didn't have to resort to
the rush shipments it used to meet holiday demand), lower RAM
prices and a product mix that included more high-end, higher-margin
models.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also reported that 28 percent of iMac buyers, according
to company-sponsored surveys, were purchasing their first computer,
while 17 percent previously owned a Windows system. Before the
easy-to-use iMac, Apple had trouble attracting new users. For
several years, most of its sales had been to its base of loyal
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be skeptical about Apple's long-term ability to win
over Wintel (Windows-Intel) users,'' said analyst Kurtis King of
Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. ``But I've come around
_ they simply offer a better product than the competition, and
they've shown the ability to take substantial market share.''
</P>
<P>
   King said he's maintaining a ``strong buy'' recommendation on
Apple's stock and increasing his target price for it to $150.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ State Sen. Mark A. MacDonald, a strapping beef
farmer and social studies teacher, knows he may have cost himself
his legislative job Wednesday when he voted with a majority of his
colleagues to approve marriage-like civil unions for gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had voted against civil unions, MacDonald said, how was he
going to explain it to his junior high students? ``That I voted the
way I did so I could get re-elected?'' he said. And ``to have the
voters think I was a good fellow and ignore all the testimony they
paid me to listen to?''
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking bill, which offers marriage benefits for gay
couples, gained final approval in the Vermont Senate on Wednesday
in a 19-11 vote. Two of the chamber's 13 Republicans joined all of
its 17 Democrats in passing the measure. It must now negotiate one
last hurdle next week in the House of Representatives, which
approved an almost identical bill last month, before it goes to
Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, for his promised signature. It would
then take effect this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure would be an American first. But it is all
the more striking in that so many Vermont lawmakers, like
MacDonald, a Democrat, have repeatedly voted in support of civil
unions despite indications from public opinion polls, phone calls,
letters and town meeting votes that they are bucking their
constituents' will and risking their seats in this fall's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see senators in tears _ they know this vote may well be
their last,'' said Sen. Peter Shumlin, the president pro tem, to
whom MacDonald gave an emotional, football-player hug after a
preliminary vote Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a vote that required more courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual seats and the slim Democratic majority in both
chambers are at stake, Shumlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked very hard to be in the majority,'' he said. ``I
recognize that today's action jeopardized that, and I know my
fellow senators recognize we jeopardize that. But there's a time
when you have to stand up for what you believe in, and this is
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing up, for some lawmakers, has required extra courage:
Several members of the House have reported recent vandalism to
their cars, which they believe is connected to their votes on civil
union. Some lawmakers say they have asked to give up their
legislators' license plates for regular ones because they are tired
of obscene gestures and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers have also described being appalled at the mail
and phone calls they have received from opponents of civil union,
who say that the legislators are working for the devil and will go
to hell and should forget about being re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Those lawmakers also take pains to say that such hostile
messages are few in number and that most of the gay marriage debate
has been conducted civilly.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases the threats appear to have backfired by
convincing lawmakers of the depth and breadth of anti-gay feeling
here, persuading them to vote for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said that hostile messages and phone calls made
them think: If this is what it is like for me, what have gays and
lesbians had to endure their whole lives?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Nancy I. Chard, a Democrat, said Wednesday that she had
complained about the nasty mail and calls to a colleague, a House
member who had come out of a cancer survivors support meeting to
find all her car windows smashed. Her friend's response, Chard
said, was that she was grateful for such messages ``because for
just a few minutes, when I read those letters, I'm able to honestly
walk in the shoes of another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Chard, asked Wednesday if she risked losing her seat with her
vote, said, ``All of us do, but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who oppose civil unions have received calls and
letters calling them bigots and homophobes, some say, even though
they are only trying to follow the will of their voters or their
own moral and religious convictions. But they do not worry aloud
about risking their seats, for which they are paid about $500 a
week for every week the Gen- eral Assembly is in session, usu- ally
about 16 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   No public opinion poll run by a neutral organization has asked
specifically whether Vermonters support civil unions, but the vast
majority of towns that discussed the issue in meetings last month
opposed the idea, and past polls showed that a majority, although a
shrinking one, opposed gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, a Burlington Free Press poll found Vermonters about
equally divided over the state Supreme Court's decision in December
that same-sex couples deserved the same protections as heterosexual
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of civil unions _ like the Roman Catholic bishop of
Burlington, who called this ``a very sad day for the majority of
Vermonters'' _ have called repeatedly for a constitutional
amendment that would be voted on by the public, or at least a
nonbinding referendum to give the population a chance to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Richard W. Sears Jr., a Democrat and the chairman of
the judiciary committee, was asked whether he thought his vote in
favor of civil unions had placed his seat in jeopardy, he replied
instantly, ``Oh, yes, sure, no question about that.''

 POCKET PCs PERFORM COMPUTERLIKE FUNCTIONS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Less is more'' has never been a part of
Microsoft's philosophy, and to judge by the handheld ``Pocket PCs''
the software giant and its hardware partners rolled out Wednesday,
it still isn't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the new gadgets reflect just the opposite approach to
product design.
</P>
<P>
   Palm, the current leader in the handheld-organizer market, has
earned that position by focusing on such Zen-like values as
simplicity, low price and long battery life. But instead of
competing on those fronts, Microsoft and friends _ chiefly, in this
context, Casio, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard _ have fallen back on
the same strategy that has served them so well in the PC arena:
trying to outmuscle the opposition with hardware horsepower and
software features.
</P>
<P>
   In those terms, they've clearly succeeded: The new devices, like
the HP Jornada 545 I've been trying out for the past 10 days, are
amazingly versatile. Microsoft isn't just kidding in calling them
``Pocket PCs.'' Although the Jornada is a shade bigger and, at 9
ounces, noticeably heavier than even the largest competing products
from Palm, it still fits easily in a pocket or purse.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Pocket PC won't run actual PC programs, the new
platform is designed to handle most of the tasks most users do on
full-size desktop or notebook systems _ not just tracking personal
information like names, addresses and appointments, but also
surfing the Web, sending and receiving e-mail, reading and editing
or even creating Word and Excel documents, playing MP3 music and
even editing digital snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   With a list of capabilities that long, the Pocket PC is bound to
be Microsoft's strongest challenge yet to Palm's grip on the
handheld category. But all that power comes at a price, not just in
dollars ($499 list, in the case of the Jornada 545) but also in
complexity, even though Microsoft has made a valiant effort to
streamline its handheld software.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Jornada 545 is a Hitachi processor running at 133
megahertz _ a contemptible number compared with today's PC
processors, but fast enough to make the Pocket PC's stripped-down
software pretty snappy. There's no hard drive _ the operating
system and core applications are stored permanently in 16 megabytes
of read-only memory, while additional programs and data you create
or download are stored in 16 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Specs
</P>
<P>
   The color touch-screen measures about 2.2 by 3 inches, with a
resolution of 240 by 320 pixels. Unlike Palm and Casio, which use
active-matrix displays in their color models, HP opted for the
passive-matrix variety, which costs less and saves battery life but
is also markedly less bright and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at its default settings, the Jornada screen is rather
dim and marred by ``shadows'' of on-screen objects. I managed to
eliminate those problems, but only by overriding the defaults to
increase the brightness, thereby taking an extra bite out of
battery life.
</P>
<P>
   The battery is a lithium-ion pack that's supposed to last
through eight hours of continuous use or about two weeks of normal
intermittent use, according to HP _ about the same as other color
models.
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll probably want to bring a charger along if
you're planning to use the device heavily when traveling _ you
can't just pop in new removable batteries. But it shouldn't be an
issue most of the time, because most users are likely to keep the
device in its docking cradle when working at their desks, and the
batteries are automatically recharged in the cradle.
</P>
<P>
   For connecting to a PC, the Jornada comes with a docking cradle
that requires a Universal Serial Bus connection. Fortunately for
those who have older machines that lack USB ports, for users of
Windows 95 and NT (which don't support USB), and for travelers who
don't want to carry the cradle, HP is also including, at least for
now, a cable that connects the Jornada to an old-fashioned serial
port.
</P>
<P>
   Other hardware features include a built-in microphone, making it
possible to use the device for recording voice notes, and both a
built-in speaker and a stereo earphone jack plus a set of earphones
_ handy if you use the device to play digital music. There's also
an infrared port that's supposed to provide wireless connections to
many notebook PCs, printers and cell phones _ more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Palm handhelds, Pocket PCs have an industry-standard
expansion slot, so it's easy to add extra memory, a modem or a
network adapter. None of those is included, but I tried a 56K modem
from Pretec Electronics and an Ethernet card from Socket
Communications; both were easy to install and worked well.
</P>
<P>
   I had one serious hardware problem with the Jornada: On three
different occasions, it suddenly presented me with urgent
low-battery warnings even though it was sitting in its cradle and,
by all appearances, connected to an AC outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Later, just as mysteriously, the system resumed charging, but at
this point, it's working only intermittently. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   Software Galore
</P>
<P>
   The software that runs the Pocket PC is actually a new version
of the operating system formerly known as Windows CE. Microsoft,
however, has dropped that moniker, apparently judging that it's too
tarnished by the failure of previous CE releases.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable, and I reckon few will miss the CE name,
but it's too bad Bill Gates or Steve Ballmer couldn't come up with
more concise replacement than the ungainly _ and misleading _
``Windows Powered'' label Pocket PC devices carry.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the underlying OS, the device's 16-megabyte ROM
includes stripped-down ``pocket'' versions of many of Microsoft's
Windows applications: Outlook (for contacts, appointments, notes
and e-mail); Internet Explorer (for browsing the Web itself when
connected to the Internet and pages stored on the device when
offline); the Windows Media Player (capable of playing MP3 files as
well as Microsoft's own digital music format); and Microsoft Money,
Word and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   Also built in is a program called Microsoft Reader, which is
intended for reading electronic books. It uses Clear Type, a new
display technology Microsoft has been touting as a revolutionary
advance in screen legibility. But I read through one of the sample
books that comes with it _ ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' _ and
didn't find the text any sharper than on other screens. I doubt
even the most gung-ho of technology enthusiasts will ever enjoy
reading a book on a 2-inch-by-3-inch display.
</P>
<P>
   HP also provides some useful utilities of its own, and the
CD-ROMs that accompany the Jornada offer a slew of additional
titles you can load if you want. The list includes Microsoft Pocket
Streets (for viewing maps downloaded from your PC); Microsoft
Transcriber (a cursive handwriting recognizer, if you're not
satisfied with the software keyboard and excellent printing
recognizer that are built in); a mini-application that retrieves
AOL Mail (when you're online, of course); a digital image-editing
program; and Yahoo Messenger, an instant-messaging and
news-retrieval tool (again, useless without an Internet
connection).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are three packages that run on your PC:
ActiveSync 3.1, which does a good job managing data exchange and
synchronization; Microsoft Outlook 2000 (the full retail version);
and MusicMatch Jukebox 4.4 (a top-rated program for creating and
organizing MP3 music).
</P>
<P>
   I tried most of this software, if only briefly, and with the
exception of Transcriber, which evoked memories of early Apple
Newtons, it all worked as advertised. Microsoft has thoroughly
remodeled its user interface, getting rid of many of the features
that cluttered up previous versions of Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the new interface is much more efficient, but it
could still use a fair amount of tweaking. In a few cases Bill
Gates' minions went too far in removing buttons _ when a reminder
about a calendar event appears on screen, for example, there's no
way to jump directly to the associated item in Pocket Outlook to
check on the details.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, Microsoft didn't simplify enough: Quitting a
running program to free up memory, for example, requires seven
clicks.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem: The 16 megabytes of RAM that come standard in
the Jornada 545 are nowhere near adequate, at least for those who
want to take advantage of the full range of Pocket PC's
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can add more memory in the form of a CompactFlash
card, but you'll have to remove it anytime you want to plug in, for
instance, a modem. If you really want to use more than the basic,
built-in Pocket PC applications, you'd probably be better off
waiting for the Jornada 548, a version with 32 megabytes of
built-in RAM that HP expects to ship in a few months. That one,
though, will set you back a hefty $599.
</P>
<P>
   Synching Up
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of Window CE had pretty pathetic
data-synchronization software, compared with the Palm Desktop.
ActiveSync 3.1, however, works very well, once you get your
connections set up. I had no problem using the serial cable, but to
my surprise, the USB cradle gave me some trouble _ I wasn't
completely surprised that I couldn't get it to work with my desktop
Windows 98 PC, since I'd had the same problem last fall with a
Handspring Visor, but I was amazed that I couldn't get it going
(even after spending hours reinstalling devices and drivers) with
an HP OmniBook laptop.
</P>
<P>
   As for the infrared port, trying to use it proved a full-scale
nightmare. Part of the problem is that most laptops, even though
equipped with IR ports, leave them disabled by default; you have to
go into the PC BIOS to enable it. And since the manuals mentioned
nothing about that, and Windows 98 kept claiming that the problem
was a software error, it took me a while to figure out that the
BIOS was the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, fixing it wasn't easy _ I spent more than 45 minutes
on the phone with a senior HP support technician before we arrived
at a combination of settings that let me connect the Jornada and
the OmniBook. And I never did manage to get the IR ports on two
Compaq laptops to work, even with the settings that solved the
problem on the OmniBook.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh owners don't have to worry about any of this:
Microsoft has never produced a Mac version of its handheld
connectivity software, so you can't hook up a Pocket PC even if you
have a USB Mac or a PowerBook with infrared.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom Line
</P>
<P>
   I've been using a palm-size Windows CE device _ a Cassiopeia
E-100 from Casio _ for nearly a year, with a lot of satisfaction,
and I had high hopes that the Pocket PC would be a significant
improvement. I am impressed with the new platform's potential, but
given the high price of the current units and the numerous rough
edges and glitches I ran into, I plan to stick with what I have.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly puzzling to me is that none of the Pocket PCs
announced so far includes a modem or, better yet, a wireless radio.
A pocket-size device that included Internet Explorer, Outlook
e-mail, AOL Mail and Yahoo Messenger would be pretty compelling if
it came, at a reasonable price, with the hardware you need to take
advantage of those programs.

 CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE POINTED TO MAFIABOY  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK AND CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Using evidence uncovered in California,
investigators have arrested a 15-year-old Canadian boy in
connection with a high-profile attack against CNN's Web site, one
of several popular sites hit in February.
</P>
<P>
   The teen, known by the handle ``Mafiaboy,'' was originally
fingered two months ago by Michael Lyle, a Palo Alto, Calif.,
computer security consultant, who said the youth had boasted in an
Internet chat room about plans to hit the Web sites of CNN and
Menlo Park, Calif.-based E-Trade shortly before those sites were
temporarily shut down. He was arrested over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators tracked him down by following clues left
behind at two computers at the University of California in Santa
Barbara, one of which was used in the attack against CNN's Web
site, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle, co-founder and chief technology officer at Recourse
Technologies, said one of the computer's logs, which records all
activity on the machine, contained an address at Sympatico, a
Canadian Internet service provider. Kevin Schmidt, a network
programmer at the university who first detected the break-in, said
accounting logs and other files ``pointed to several sites in the
U.S. and Canada.'' Presumably, investigators could then obtain
subpoenas to check the logs at each of those other sites for
additional clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say (the UC Santa Barbara logs) pointed to him
explicitly and directly,'' Schmidt said yesterday, but ``we had
information that did point in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who announced the arrest at a
news conference in Montreal on Wednesday, so far have charged the
juvenile only with attacking CNN. The Mounties said that Mafiaboy
jammed CNN and 1,200 sites it hosts for four hours. But authorities
said they are investigating whether he might be responsible for
hitting other sites.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a dozen commercial sites, including Yahoo,
E-Trade and eBay, were attacked over a span of three days in
February.
</P>
<P>
   All of the sites were hit by so-called ``distributed denial of
service'' attacks, in which Internet users use dozens of powerful
computers to swamp a Web site with phony requests for data, keeping
real users from getting through.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts doubted Mafiaboy could have been responsible for
all of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems incomprehensible to me that one 15-year-old could
have done all that,'' said William Eyres, a security management
expert who has worked with police and Congress on hacking problems
in the past. ``That's an awful lot of work and coordination.''
</P>
<P>
   Security experts also said the vandals used different methods to
knock out some of the Web sites. Mafiaboy, for instance, used a
software program called Tribe Flood Network, which is widely
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyle said the people behind the initial attack on Yahoo used
custom-designed software and several more sophisticated methods.
Apparently, they also left fewer clues, which could help explain
why they haven't been arrested. ``Mafiaboy was a copycat,'' Lyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet hackers, including one who goes by the name of
Coolio, also reportedly bragged that they were involved in the
attacks. Police arrested Coolio, a 17-year-old teen, last month for
defacing several Web sites, including an anti-drug site in Los
Angeles and one run by a computer security firm. But the teen,
Dennis F. Moran, said he was only joking when he confessed in an
Internet chat room that he was responsible for shutting down Yahoo
and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Mounties said they tracked down Mafiaboy's location less
than a week after CNN was hit, and knew the identity of the boy two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the teen could be sentenced to serve up to two
years in prison, although juveniles charged with hacking are
normally just asked to make restitution and are put on probation.
He could also be prohibited from using a computer.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN spokeswoman declined to comment on the arrest. But Richard
Power, editorial director for the Computer Security Institute, an
association of security professionals in San Francisco, estimated
that the attacks on all the Web sites, including shopping sites
like Amazon and eBay, may have cost them as much as $10 million in
lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the attacks, the White House and others called on
Web sites to increase security. The FBI even distributed software
to help spot programs that could be used in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But security experts acknowledged that Web sites are still
vulnerable, in part because denial of service attacks are so hard
to fend off. Attackers typically use dozens of computers, and often
forge the return addresses of traffic, making it difficult for Web
sites to quickly identify where the fake traffic is coming from and
shut it off.
</P>
<P>
   And although major Web sites are always beefing up their
security, hackers are working just as quickly to identify new
flaws. ``The same kind of thing could happen tomorrow,'' said
Marketta Silvera, head of Alameda security firm Pilot Network
Services. Hacking ``techniques evolve around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and other security experts plan to speak
at a ``town hall'' meeting in San Francisco today to raise
awareness about the possible threat from cyberterrorists and
foreign governments, including China and Russia, who are investing
in electronic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It illustrates the severity of the problem,'' said Jeffrey
Hunker, a National Security adviser and senior White House adviser.
``Here you have a single individual who disrupted CNN and several
other sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum, which will be hosted by ZDNet at their main office,
will be broadcast on the company's Web site ( &LR; www.zdnet.com &LR; )
starting at 10 a.m.

 PG&AMP;E'S ECO-FRIENDLY IMAGE FALLS ON ITS FACE  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ PG&AMP;E Corp., parent of San Francisco's Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., worked hard at the company's annual shareholder
meeting Wednesday to depict itself as a champion of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the energy business, you're in the environment
business,'' Bob Glynn, PG&AMP;E's chief executive, told the two dozen
or so shareholders who turned up for the meeting _ the company's
first to be held outside the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   A firm commitment to safeguarding the environment, he said, ``is
how I sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Local environmentalists weren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he sleeps at night,'' said Lori Ehrlich,
co-founder of Salem Power Plant HealthLink, a grassroots
organization working to clean up two Massachusetts facilities
purchased by PG&AMP;E in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get any unrehearsed answers to our questions,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing was just corporate whitewashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although PG&AMP;E officials insisted that there was no connection
between the decision to move the shareholder meeting outside of San
Francisco and negative publicity surrounding the Julia Roberts
movie ``Erin Brockovich,'' many of those in the crowd were not so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a shareholder, you don't always know what the company is
doing,'' said John Tierney. ``They tell you words that are soothing
to the ears, but who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is the environment,'' said Melvin Thornhill,
who has held PG&AMP;E stock for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said before the meeting that he was there ``to listen and see
what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't much. Taking the podium, Glynn praised PG&AMP;E's
financial performance and service record, and stressed that ``our
environmental commitment and performance were strong in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was optimistic that PG&AMP;E's earnings per share will
rise by as much as 10 percent in the future and emphasized that
``shareholder value is our metric.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings Results
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E will report its latest quarterly results Thursday. The
company said last month that it lost $611 million ($1.67 per share)
in the final quarter of 1999. That compares with a profit of $196
million (51 cents) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the metric of shareholder value was
discussed by board members as they dined Tuesday night on sea bass,
salad and a tasty-looking poached-pear dessert in a private dining
room at the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, site of this year's
shareholder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn did not answer directly when asked during the meeting by
one shareholder, John Cheveddon, a regular attendee at PG&AMP;E's
annual get-togethers, how much it cost to fly the company's top
brass to Boston and put them up for about a week at the Four
Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may have been unintentional, PG&AMP;E clearly had the
deck stacked in its favor yesterday. The number of board members,
executives and company employees in the ballroom far exceeded the
shareholders in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Most seats in the audience were empty until PG&AMP;E staff members
began quickly filling them as the presentation commenced.
</P>
<P>
   The company seemed to be expecting trouble. Police and hotel
security personnel were on guard in the lobby, and a small army of
beefy men wearing earphones roamed the meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of East Coast shareholders who braved cold, rainy
weather to attend had to submit to thorough security checks before
entering the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came from the airport and I didn't have to go through
anything like that,'' said one annoyed shareholder, Nancy Goulart.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came off without a hitch, though, and it was clear
from Glynn's relaxed demeanor during the question-and-answer period
that he had prepared well before arriving in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Arthur Burns took Glynn to task for ``a disconnect
between the environmental subjects you spoke about and what's been
going on in Massachusetts for the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Terming PG&AMP;E's environmental record ``a disaster,'' Burns said
cases of cancer, leukemia and asthma among neighbors of PG&AMP;E's
local plants are higher than in other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn replied: ``We want to have all our facilities to be in
full compliance with all the regulations that apply to them.''
</P>
<P>
   This is something of a mantra among PG&AMP;E officials. Lisa
Franklin, the company's chief spokesman in the Northeast, said
earlier that PG&AMP;E's plants ``operate under a comprehensive system
of authorizations. We operate in complete accordance with those
authorizations.''
</P>
<P>
   And during an interview with The Chronicle after the shareholder
meeting, Glynn declined to elaborate on how his company's
environmental record goes beyond mere compliance with regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compliance is the foundation upon which everything else is
built,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't Seen the Movie
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had not yet seen ``Erin Brockovich,'' which
tells the story of how PG&AMP;E reached a $333 million settlement with
residents of the Southern California town of Hinkley after toxic
chemicals from a PG&AMP;E plant poisoned their water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn said it wasn't high on his list of things to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was, I would have seen it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Brockovich was forced to cancel plans to attend
the shareholder meeting because of ear troubles that prevented her
from flying from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But her assistant, Chrissy Albice, did show up and asked Glynn
what steps PG&AMP;E is taking to prevent toxic leaks in other towns
where the company has facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn replied that PG&AMP;E has a strong ethics policy in place as
well as regular environmental audits and a toll-free number that
employees can call to report problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ethics policy,'' he said, ``says we must comply with all
laws and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn said he was unable to respond to a lawsuit announced
Tuesday by Boston's Conservation Law Foundation because he had not
yet seen the group's notification letter.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, to be filed in federal court, will demand that PG&AMP;E
take steps to clean up operations at its plants in Salem Harbor and
at Brayton Point in Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the two oil- and coal-burning plants plants are
responsible for contaminating the groundwater with a variety of
toxic chemicals and exposing surrounding communities to potentially
harmful airborne pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Invitation to Talk
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder Lisa Evans, a former attorney with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, invited Glynn to sit down with her
and other local residents to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn said he appreciated the offer but pointedly did not say
whether he would accept the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He completely blew us off,'' Evans said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Thornhill, the longtime shareholder who had wanted to
hear what PG&AMP;E would say about its environmental troubles, was
similarly disappointed as the meeting finally adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't answered the questions,'' the retired college
professor said of Glynn. ``I don't feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 45 years, in fact, Thornhill said he's
thinking about selling his shares in the company.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Champagne and exhilaration washed along the street in
Little Havana Wednesday, as a federal appeals court not only
extended an order that will keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the
United States until the court hears the full appeal of his case,
but also criticized the way government officials had handled his
request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, on Wednesday
barred anyone from taking Elian out of the country until the court
hears the child's case on May 11, and, in pointed language,
suggested that his Miami relatives' efforts to have his request for
asylum heard in court should not have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in a legal sense, only a ruling on an emergency
injunction to keep the child in this country for a few more weeks,
but the language seemed to chastise the government for asserting
that only the boy's father was legally entitled to speak for him.
Elian's father lives in Cuba and came to this country early this
month to take the boy back with him.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ensures that questions of who rightfully speaks for
the boy and whether he is entitled to apply for asylum will be
fully aired.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of court concluded unanimously that they
``doubt that protecting a party's day in court, when he has an
appeal of arguable merit, is contrary to the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling lent credence to the Miami family's argument that the
small boy is a bona fide candidate for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But in their conclusion, the judges wrote that the ``true legal
merits of this case will be finally decided in the future,''
adding, ``We need to think more and hard about this case for which
no sure and clear answers shine out today.''
</P>
<P>
   The government could try to have the stay lifted by the full
circuit court or a Supreme Court justice, or take no action until
the hearing in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to pray,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, who defied a federal order last week to give up the
boy and bring him to an airport for eventual reunification with his
Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Miami house, demonstrators celebrated with geysers of
champagne and quiet prayers over clenched rosaries. The festivities
continued into the night, bringing dis- ruptions of traffic into
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for the Cuban people,'' said Francisca G.
Espinosa, 68, a retiree who lives in Miami Beach. It was unclear if
she was referring to Cubans on this side of the Florida Straits,
the other side or to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not answer a key question: who should have
custody of Elian while the legal process plays out.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service have insisted that Elian be reunited with his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who is waiting for his child at a Cuban diplomat's
house outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding that issue, Attorney General Janet Reno said, the
court left her the option of removing the boy from his uncle's home
_ as she has threatened to do for days. But Wednesday night, it
remained unclear whether she would take such a step, and officials
inside the department indicated they had been surprised by the
court's decision and were confused about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's order does not preclude me from placing Elian in
his father's care while he is in the United States,'' Reno said, as
she stepped off a plane in Oklahoma City, where she had gone to
attend a memorial service for victims of the bombing of the federal
building there five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five months after the boy was found floating on an inner
tube off the coast of Florida in a failed crossing from Cuba that
drowned his mother and 10 others, Elian remained encircled
Wednesday night by demonstrators at the house in Miami, many of
whom have said they will simply not allow the boy to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``We are going to take and consider all our options
and take the course of action that we deem appropriate under the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the reunion of father and son seemed assured. In
March, a U.S. district court judge in Miami upheld an Immigration
and Naturalization Service order to return Elian to his father
without a formal hearing on Elian's request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the INS have said only the boy's
father can speak for him, stressing that common sense dictates that
a 6-year-old cannot understand the complex issue of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court in Atlanta seemed critical of how both
agencies have treated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it appear that plaintiff might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so,'' wrote the
panel, referring to a request for asylum signed by Elian.
``According to the record, plaintiff, although a young child, has
expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes. It is not clear that the
INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the only proper
representative, considered all of the relevant factors,
particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel went on to write that, under the Immigration Service's
own guidelines, a minor can, under some circumstances, apply for
asylum even against ``the express wishes of his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said the ruling allows the Miami family to continue to
turn the boy against his father in what he has referred to as
brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government does not act immediately to remove Elian
from the care of Lazaro Gonzalez and return him to his father, it
will bear responsibility for the harm that continues to be
inflicted on Juan Miguel's beloved son,'' said Craig.
</P>

   ``Not only has Elian remained in the custody and control of his
Miami relatives, his situation has deteriorated,'' said Craig. Last
week, family members in Miami videotaped Elian in what appeared to
be a coached message to his father, in which the boy said he wanted
to remain in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was another setback for the federal government in a
case that saw the attorney general travel to Miami to try to work
out a deal to reunite the father and son.
</P>
<P>
   That trip that ended with Lazaro Gonzalez saying that if federal
officials wanted the boy, the would have to come into his home,
encircled by supporters, and take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the legal right to remove him, but politically
speaking, it puts his removal very much in question,'' said Pamela
Falk, a professor of international law at the City University of
New York who has argued cases similar to Elian's.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other political experts said the ruling may also
bode well for the family's full appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision scolds the INS for not considering Elian's
interest, and scolds them for not ever speaking to Elian,'' she
said. ``This decision gives a great boost to the possibility of the
success of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the family wins the appeal, it only means that the
boy's asylum request returns to Immigration, and Reno is,
ultimately, in charge of that agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the boy just goes back to Reno,'' Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the fight in Miami goes on to keep the child in the
house and away from a father that many people here see as an agent,
or a puppet, of the Fidel Castro government.

   Lawyers for the family seemed hopeful that they, and an army of
Cuban Americans, could keep the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted,'' said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for the
relatives. ``Had the boy been taken out of the country and we had
won the appeal, what would we have won?''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, said Garcia-Pedrosa, would never have come back from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the house on Northwest Second Street, demonstrators let down
their vigil long enough to joyously celebrate one more victory over
the U. S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a small step, but it is in the right
direction,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has led the demonstration
outside the house since the standoff began five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted ``Fidel, crazy man, you have little time
left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is working,'' said Miguel Saavedra, president of
Vigilia Mambisa, an exile group in Miami. He uncorked a bottle of
champagne, soaking several people. ``Justice in the U.S. is
working. Everyone is so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Miami is happy. Overhead, a plane droned by
trailing a banner that said ``SEND ELIAN HOME _ The Taxpayers.''
The banner was apparently in reference to the millions of dollars
the standoff, and the demand for added police and other municipal
services, is costing Miami and Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   And, one reporter was stabbed with a ball-point pen by an
agitated demonstrator.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing seemed to dampen the mood among Cuban Americans
here, who see the return of Elian to Cuba as a victory for Castro.
They either discount or ignore the wishes of relatives there for
the boy's return, and view their pleas for his return as communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a little kid,'' said James B. Exposito, 16, a
freshman at Miami High School. ``Over there he doesn't have
nothing. He won't have the love of his family there. They take care
of him here. Everybody will take care of him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the home, a non-Cuban vendor from New York sold T-shirts
with the words ``Elian Lives in America Now'' for $10, or two for
$15.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade mayor, Alex Penelas, who drew criticism from
around the country last month when he openly sided with
demonstrators and said he would not use the county's police to
assist in removing Elian from the home, encouraged the
demonstrators to rally around the house, but ``to do so in a
peaceful manner and not infringe on the rights of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health experts have said that the crowds and noise
and tension that surround the house are harming the boy, who plays
in the yard under the glare of strobe lights. Juan Miguel Gonzalez
has said the Miami relatives are emotionally abusing his son by
filling his head with lies.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowds say they simply cannot let him go, and that this
fight is, even five months old, really just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this ruling, we think it is plain that this is
in fact a very serious appeal,'' said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for
the family. ``And at the same time, no one should make predictions
on the ultimate outcome based on this order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, who has chain-smoked in his yard until the
early morning, keeping his own vigil, walked late Wednesday
afternoon to a neighborhood store. He bought a carton of Marlboros,
and went home to Miami's seemingly never-ending story.
