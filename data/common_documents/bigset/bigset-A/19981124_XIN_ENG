<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner: Rail Liberalization Not on Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union
official comforted railway workers who went on strike on Monday by
saying that rail liberalization is not on the agenda for the next
European council of transport ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The only item for discussion next Monday is a package of
essentially technical measures that are designed to enhance the
efficiency and the quality of rail freight and harmonize the
technical side of rail operations to ensure that international
rail services can compete on an equal footing," said Neil Kinnock,
EU commissioner responsible for transportation.
</P>
<P>
Railway workers from six EU member states went on a 24-hour
strike from Monday to protest against a decision to liberalize
rail freight market, which the strikers claimed would be made at
next Monday's European council of transport ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock said that it was well understood that the huge loss in
railway's share of the freight transport market has to be reversed
if railway is to survive as a significant transport means.
</P>
<P>
In the 15-nation EU, the rail's share of freight transport fell
from 32 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 1996, according to
statistics of the European Commission, the executive body of the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials warned that without change there will be
no rail transport in much of the union by the year 2012 and the
job loss will be devastating.
</P>
<P>
Half a million jobs have been lost in European railway industry
in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock attributed the job loss to the absence of strategies
that are designed to revitalize the railway industry.
</P>
<P>
The rail's share of passenger traffic also dropped from 10
percent in 1970 to six percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock said the only means of keeping jobs in the railway
industry in the short, medium and long term lies in ensuring that
rail services for freight transport appeal to customer needs, and
railway reforms create competitive conditions in which the railway
industry can prosper.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesperson said that there seemed to be a
confusion between competitiveness and liberalization, and that the
commission does not deal with the issue of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The railway workers are striking to protest against pay
conditions, personnel shortages and liberalization-related job
cuts.

<HEADLINE> One-Quarter of World Population to Suffer Water Scarcity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- One-quarter of the world's
population will suffer severe water scarcity within the next 25
years, and this will pose the single greatest threat to food
security, human health and natural ecosystems of the next century,
say scientists at the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 countries with 40 percent of the world's population are
already experiencing water shortages, 1.3 billion people lack
clean water in the developing countries and 2 billion people do
not have adequate sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Development experts say that water scarcity, not shortage of
land, will be the main future constraint to agriculture production
in developing countries. Slightly more than 1 billion people live
in arid regions that will face absolute water scarcity by 2025,
which means that they will not have sufficient water resources to
maintain 1990 levels of per capita food production from irrigated
agriculture, even at higher levels of irrigation efficiency, while
meeting reasonable water needs for domestic, industrial and
environmental purposes.
</P>
<P>
Experts say new technologies and better management can help to
avert water shortages in the next century that are expected to
affect some of the world's major breadbaskets.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Proposes to Cut U.S. Nuclear Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon has quietly
recommended that the United States consider unilateral cuts in
nuclear arsenal, because of weakening security threats and growing
budget constraints, the New York Times reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed cuts would reduce the U.S. arsenal below the 6,000
nuclear warheads allowed by the first strategic arms reduction
treaty, or START I, senior Clinton administration officials told
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The second arms treaty, START II, signed by the U.S. and Russia
in 1993, would cut their arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500
warheads. But the Russian Parliament has refused to approve it.
</P>
<P>
The Times said that the Pentagon believes that the unilateral
reduction would have no effect on the America's ability to deter a
nuclear adversary.
</P>
<P>
Because of the delay over START II, the Pentagon faces paying
hundreds of millions of dollars to maintain and soon to rebuild
nuclear weapons that the U.S. has agreed to scrap.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has spent 95 million U.S. dollars more over the
past two years than it would have if START II had taken effect,
the Times said. Next year it would cost 100 million dollars more,
and the year after next, 1 billion dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Navy may have to pay more than 5 billion dollars between
now and 2003 to refuel nuclear reactors and install new missiles
on four Trident submarines that would otherwise dismantled, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon in April submitted to Congress a highly classified
report outlining nine proposals for reducing the strategic arsenal
unilaterally, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official told the Times neither U.S.
President Bill Clinton nor Secretary of Defense William Cohen has
made a decision on the Pentagon's recommendations and would not do
so until Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament completes its
latest deliberations on START II.

ATHENS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of Greece's young
drug addicts had increased sharply in the past five years,
according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was conducted by Greece's mental health
institute, showed that the use of illegal narcotic substances, and
particularly hashish, had more than doubled among the student
population since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 percent of male students and 10 percent of female ones
aged 17-18 had tried narcotic substances while the rates of those
aged 18-24 were 32 percent for males and 12 percent for females.

Experts warned that although drug use was more prevalent among
men, women seemed to be closing the gap over the past years.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Back Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 British business
leaders have signed a statement urging the government to join the
European single currency soon after it is established.
</P>
<P>
They warned that staying out indefinitely "would pose a serious
threat to our future prosperity and to our influence in the
world."
</P>
<P>
The statement, published in the Financial Times Monday, said,
"Britain's best economic interest is likely to involve joining
soon after EMU is established, and the best policy for Britain is
one based on the assumption that we will join."
</P>
<P>
The signatories include the chairmen or chief executives of
companies with a total turnover of more than 200 billion pounds
(320 billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to about 25 percent of UK
Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of BUPA, Bryan Nicholson, who coordinated the
statement, said, "The vast majority of British firms want Britain
to join a successful single currency because it will mean a much
more stable economic future for Britain."
</P>
<P>
"They see membership of the single currency as vital to
Britain's future prosperity and influence," he added.
</P>
<P>
The statement reinforces evidence, including a poll by Mori,
that most businessmen favor joining the single currency.
</P>
<P>
A debate at the Confederation of British Industry conference
earlier this month also found 90 percent of delegates thought the
UK would join Euro.

<HEADLINE> Big Countries Urged to Further Improve Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday
expressed the hope that big countries should continuously improve
their relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders made the appeal in a Sino-Russian joint
statement released after their informal meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the post-cold war era, in recent years in particular, they
said, the notable improvement of relations among big countries has
become an important positive factor in the development of
interlational situation.
</P>
<P>
To establish a new world economic and political order, not only
the trend should be maintained and strengthened, but also efforts
should be made to create conditions that will keep big countries
from expanding their existing military and political blocs or
setting up new ones, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Big countries should stop confrontation and containment in any
forms, and abandon the intention to carve up spheres of influence
in any regions, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the present-day world, it said, there exist no problems of
principle among big countries, which cannot be settled through
dialogues on a equal footing, as long as they observe the spirit
of partnership and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents believed that the nuclear disarmament
process should continue.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening
the treaty on the limitation of anti-ballistic missile systems,
saying it was, and still is one of the corner stones in ensuring
the strategic stability of the world.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also held that the economic vitalization of
developing countries and the strengthening of their constructive
role in international affairs are crucial to the promotion of
peace and prosperity of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the commitment of their respective countries to
deepening cooperation with developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They also called on advanced countries to help developing
countries more actively with their economic development.

<HEADLINE> British Farmers Welcome Ending of Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- British farmers Monday welcomed
the European Union's decision to end the ban on British beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
Ben Gill, president of Britain's National Farmers' Union, said
the long-awaited news would bring a tremendous sense of relief to
livestock farmers who had lived with the ban, imposed nearly three
years ago over mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a huge psychological boost for farmers with the
desperation of recent times turning into cheers of jubilation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Les Armstrong, from the National Farmers' Union, said the
future looked more certain for British beef farmers.
</P>
<P>
"It is progress, they have accepted that what we have done is
right, that it has made British beef the safest and they are
prepared to move on from there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meat and Livestock Commission Marketing Director Gwynne Howells
said lost ground had to be regained and foreign consumers had to
be convinced that UK-reared beef was safe, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
"The confidence of consumers and of the industry in those
countries will need to be built step by step.
</P>
<P>
"And the approach in different countries may well be different.
We'll have a different approach to Germany, for example, than we
would to Spain," Howells said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Brown, speaking from the National Primestock Show in
Staffordshire, central England, said lifting the ban would not
mean Britain would be able to sell lorryloads of beef overnight.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "At least it's the opening of the door. We've got
to start from scratch again, very slowly, but the confidence is
here. We've got the challenge again as farmers. We shall take it
up. I think you've heard of the British spirit, and the farmers
represent it."
</P>
<P>
The worldwide export ban was imposed in March 1996 in response
to the announcement of a suspected link between BSE in cattle and
the human equivalent of the disease, CJD.
</P>
<P>
Since the block was introduced, British farmers have lost an
export market worth an annual 650 million pounds (1.08 billion
U.S. dollars). Some of them have gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
The government-backed Meat and Livestock Commission is now
ready to distribute tens of thousands of promotional leaflets.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet, entitled British Beef Returns, details the huge
changes the industry has gone through in an attempt to satisfy
European preconditions for re-entering the export market.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Concerned with Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China Monday voiced
concern over the situation in Kosovo, South Asia and the Korean
Peninsula, which they fear would disrupt the process to establish
a just and reliable international order.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the meeting between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the two
leaders described them as the most serious and upgrading conflicts
which may pose practical threats to the international community.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo situation, the two countries agreed that to seek
a political solution is the top priority.
</P>
<P>
They said only on the basis of respecting Yugoslavia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the legitimate rights and
interests of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo region, and observing
the United Nations Charter and established principles of the
international law, can a solution acceptable to all the
conflicting sides be found.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in South Asia, Russia and China reiterated the
significance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and urged all the countries
which have not signed the two treaties to sign them.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the South Asian countries to resume political
talks, which could help solve unsettled problems, safeguard and
enhance regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China also believed that the crisis in Afghanistan
cannot be settled through force. The only way to peace is to set
up a representative government which can fully take into
consideration the legitimate rights and interests of various
ethnic, religious and political groups in the Afghan society.
</P>
<P>
They also said the United Nations and all the countries which
hope to see the stable situation restored in Afghanistan have the
responsibility to urge the conflicting sides to stop military
actions against each other and begin talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined the importance of the settlement of
the Korean Peninsula issue to achieve stability in the
Asia-Pacific region. Any form of talks between the northern and
southern sides, which can be accepted by both, will be conducive
to the settlement, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It also said increased talks, trust and cooperation in the
frame of the Association of South East Asian Nations forum will
help promote peace, stability and security in the region.

<HEADLINE> IWMI Develops World Water, Climate Atlas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Water
Management Institute (IWMI) has developed the World Water and
Climate Atlas, according to a press release issued here Monday by
the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.
</P>
<P>
The IWMI is one of 16 CGIAR centers.
</P>
<P>
The World Water and Climate Atlas is a computerized tool that
allows scientists, agronomists, specialists in agriculture,
irrigation and weather, and farmers to zero in on their region of
the globe and extract key water and climate data visually.
</P>
<P>
The atlas will display and map the temperature, precipitation
and other parameters for single months, crop seasons or annual
periods.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an enormous quantity of additional information on
population densities, river basins, vegetative indices, and other
factors can also be visually displayed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
The IWMI says the goal of the atlas is to provide a
computer-based atlas of world climate and related water and
natural resources data in a format that could be quickly and
easily used in geographic information systems studies.
</P>
<P>
The atlas is said to have various applications including:
identifying areas suitable for rainfed agriculture; providing
inputs for hydrological modeling of river basins; extracting
climate information to determine crop potential and helping
conserve water and estimating demand globally, nationally and by
river basins.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Refuses to Join Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak said on Monday that he has no plan to
form a national unity government with the ruling Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Barak made it clear during the consultations with the Knesset
(parliament) members of his party in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he would contact Knesset members of other
parties in a bid to put forward early general elections instead of
forming a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
His pronounced the position after a report of local daily
Haaretz said on Monday that the opposition leader intended to
join a unity government.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources close to Barak as saying that he
would consent to talking to Netanyahu about a unity government if
the premier asked him publicly.
</P>
<P>
But the sources emphasized that Barak does not trust Netanyahu
and believes it would be impossible to work with him.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu signed a land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians last month, the right-wing in his coalition has
threatened to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members noted that the aftermath of the deal has
made expanding the coalition and forming a unity government with
Labor a must. Otherwise, the government would be controlled by
small right-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu reportedly viewed a unity government only as a
last resort to hold off early elections, fearing that if he
approached Barak over the issue he would be abandoned finally by
the right-wing, the religious parties and Labor.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Military Option Open on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said Monday military option remains open if Iraq
fails to comply fully with United Nations weapons inspectors,
including turning over documents they requested on chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We have in place in the Gulf enough capability to carry out
any military options the president might decide would be
required," Cohen said at a Pentagon press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Just a week after a military is averted against Iraq, Baghdad
said over the weekend that documents demanded by the U.N. do not
exist.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said "a lot of questions have to be asked and answered"
about the most recent standoff to determine whether Iraq actually
has balked at cooperating.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) conducting the inspections, has done "exactly the right
thing" in requesting the documents because of repeated confusing
statements the Iraqis have made about their capabilities since the
Gulf War, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that the inspections of suspected weapons sites
also must continue.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Iraq can avoid air strikes simply by claiming
certain documents don't exist, Cohen declined to say what would
set off a new military offensive.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "I think it is up to Iraq to fully cooperate
with UNSCOM. A failure to do so certainly leaves open the option
of whether or not the president would order a military option in
the future."

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks 1.2 Billion U.S. Dollars for Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel has asked the United
States for 1.2 billion U.S. dollars to finance its redeployment
from parts of the West Bank, and the United States gave a "quite
positive response," an Israeli embassy official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman made the request Sunday
at a meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat
and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk, said the official
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The aid, pledged in principle when Israel and the Palestinians
signed the Wye River agreement last month, is on top of the 3
billion U.S. dollars a year Israel receives from Washington.
</P>
<P>
It will go to relocate military bases as well as for more
controversial projects such as bypass roads allowing Jewish
settlers to circumvent Palestinian-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the three-stage Israeli redeployment,
carried out last Friday, brought Palestinian rule to the doorstep
of several Jewish settlements in the area.
</P>
<P>
Neeman has left Washington and is spending Monday in New York,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank territory while Palestine will carry out
a plan to ensure security for Israel.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Police Officers Urged to Inspect Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Inspector-General of Ugandan
Police John Cossy Odomel Monday urged senior police officers in
the east African country to inspect police stations and posts
often so that policemen can maintain alertness and disciple.
</P>
<P>
Odomel made the remarks here Monday afternoon when touring the
Nsambya Police Barracks, the biggest of its kind in sub-Saharan
region.
</P>
<P>
Some policemen on duty are vulnerable to attacks from
terrorists and criminals because they are either drunk or engaged
in group discussion, the police boss told a police gathering.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Police Spokesman Bob Ngobi and some other
senior officers from the Police Headquarters and Kampala Region,
the inspector-general toured the barracks which house over 10,000
police staff and their family members.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi told Xinhua Monday morning in a telephone interview that
the tour was part of the routine inspection by the police boss
who should know the living and working conditions of the
policemen and hear their grievances.
</P>
<P>
Odomel is expected to tour 10 police stations and posts in the
capital city this week.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's GDP Records Negative Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's real gross
domestic product (GDP) contracted 2.3 percent annually during the
third quarter of the year, compared with a 0.3 percent growth in the
second quarter, figures released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA)
on Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
The figures surprised even the most pessimistic economists, falling
far beyond the market consensus of a minus 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the sharpest decline in GDP since a 2.9 percent fall in the
first quarter of 1994, just prior to the first all-race elections in
April 1994.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter decrease is mainly due to a 5.2 percent
annualized decline in manufacturing, with five of the 10 main sectors
showing a decline. Agriculture, forestry and fishing fell 19.5
percent in the quarter, mining and quarrying 2.1 percent and
construction 4.2 percent, all contributing to the slowdown in GDP
growth.
</P>
<P>
These decreases were partially neutralized by positive quarterly
annualized growth in the community services sector (1.7 percent), the
transport and communication sector (1.4 percent) and the finance and
real estate sector (1.2 percent).

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Costs UK Lives, Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Mad cow disease has been a
nightmare to Britain -- costing the country 4 billion pounds (6.6
billion U.S. dollars) and 30 lives, with farming industry in deep
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown says the cost of clearing up
the disease will reach 4 billion pounds by 2001.
</P>
<P>
"BSE has been nothing short of a disaster," Brown said Friday
in his Newcastle, north-east England, constituency. "A disaster
for consumers, for farmers and for the national interest."
</P>
<P>
Thirty people have already died of a new strain of the human
version of BSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), believed to have
come from their eating contaminated beef products.
</P>
<P>
Britain has faced massive bills for compensation to farmers,
who have been forced to slaughter 2.6 million animals -- cattle
that have been in contact with the disease or that are old enough
to have eaten contaminated feed before it was banned.
</P>
<P>
In addition, farmers have been given extra payments to make up
for a slump in the beef market, which was worth some 650 million
pounds (1.08 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has also plagued Britain's relations with its
European neighbors and begged serious questions about the
government's overseeing of the politically influential food
industry.
</P>
<P>
Power generation companies could yet get in on the act. They
may burn some of the 257,000 tons of meat and bone meal that have
accumulated in stores in their power stations at a possible cost
of 70 million pounds (116.8 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Senior Iranian officials on
Monday assured Russia that Iran will use nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes and will pose no harm to any countries.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made by Iranian Majlis (Islamic Consultative
Assembly) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and First Deputy Speaker
Hassan Rouhani in their separate meetings with visiting Russian
Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov.
</P>
<P>
It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a member of the Nuclear
Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons,
Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to complete the
construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran,
defying pressures of the United States, which has repeatedly
attempted to convince Russia not to cooperate on the project.
</P>
<P>
Washington warned that any kind of nuclear assistance to Iran
could aid Iran's alleged nuclear weapons plans, but Russia argued
that the plant is purely for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Nouri criticized the United States for its opposition to
Tehran-Moscow nuclear cooperation, saying that Washington is
against, through every possible means, those countries which
resist its expansionist goals.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker complained Washington's double standard in
the nuclear non-proliferation issue.
</P>
<P>
No objection has been made to Israel, which has acquired
nuclear weapons but refused to join the international disarmament
convention, because of U.S. support for that regime, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with Tehran-Moscow relations, Nouri
said the two countries should strive for further expansion of
their ties.
</P>
<P>
He named oil, gas, plane manufacturing and technical fields as
suitable grounds for Iran and Russia to promote their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Adamov, Rouhani said Iran is for a Middle
East free of nuclear weapons within the framework of the NPT,
expressing the hope that the agreements between the two countries
will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Adamov briefed Iranian officials on Russia's measures to
complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Since Russia is sure that Iran will use atomic energy for
peaceful purposes, it resists pressures from a third country to
cut cooperation with Iran, the Russian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Adamov, who arrived here on Saturday, said that Russian
political and parliamentary officials are firmly determined to
expand multi-faceted cooperation with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Opium, Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Monday that its
security forces confiscated one tonne of opium in the southern
province of Fars during the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the provincial security forces Brigadier General
Yousef Reza Abolfathi said that the haul was mainly seized in
northern and northeastern parts of the province, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Several international drug smugglers were also arrested during
the operations, Abolfathi added.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also seized some 857 kilograms of various
illicit drugs in Birjand, northeastern Khorasan province during
the past two weeks, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Birjand security forces Colonel Mohammadreza
Tamandi said on Sunday that 198 narcotic traffickers were arrested
in the province and handed over to judiciary officials.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that nearly two tonnes of illicit drugs were
confiscated and 600 traffickers were arrested by Birjand security
forces since the beginning of this Iranian calendar year (March
21, 1998 - March 20, 1999).
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has been a serious social problem for Iran
since the country is one of the main routes for international
smugglers to transfer drugs from west Asia to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which imposes the
death penalty on anyone caught possessing five kilograms of opium
or 30 grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Iran's anti-drug headquarters Mohammad Fallah said
on Sunday that Iran has confiscated 110 tonnes of various
narcotics since the beginning of this Iranian calendar year.
</P>
<P>
About 2,575 Iranian law enforcement personnel have lost their
lives in the anti-drug campaign since 1979, he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Saudi Arabia To Set Up Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia initialed
an agreement here on Monday for the establishment of a free trade
zone.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for gradual exemption from taxes and
customs tariffs on goods produced in the zone by 2004, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But a number of agricultural products, vehicles and textiles
are exceptions to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the agreement, Egyptian Undersecretary of
Trade and Supply Sayed Abdul-Komsan said the two countries have
agreed to continue talks on the technicalities for the
establishment of the free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Komsan said the agreement will help boost trade relations
between non-governmental organizations of the two countries and
the exchanges of expertise in addition to the training of Saudi
technical personnel.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also aims at the establishment of an Arab free
trade zone, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, whose trade with the other Arab countries stands at less
than 10 percent of its total foreign trade, is keen on promoting
free trade in the Arab world. It is close to signing free trade
agreements separately with Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> U.S. NGO to Help Rural Angolan Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. non-governmental
organization (NGO) Winrck signed an agreement here Monday with
the Angolan government to help implement a development project
for Angolan rural women.
</P>
<P>
According to a government resource, the agreement between
Winrck and the Angolan Ministry of Promotion for Families and
Women was aimed at helping rural women in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. NGO will provide farming technology and seeds of
improved variety to the Angolan women so that they can boost
production, reduce poverty and raise their own social status.
</P>
<P>
For the first phase of the implementation of the agreement,
Winrck will provide one million U.S. Dollars and study a
micro-credit project in the coffee planting areas in Angola's
northern Uige Province.
</P>
<P>
The mini agricultural loan project was targeted at improving
the living standard of the rural women and helping diversify the
economy in the coffee districts.
</P>
<P>
As written in the agreement, each Angolan woman can get a
credit worth some 690 Dollars and can choose one or two business
items such as cow raising and vegetable planting. The loan
should be repaid in three years.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 Angolan women have already benefited from the
micro-credit project since it was put into trial operation.
</P>
<P>
The funds for the project mainly come from the public and
private financial institutions in Angola, and those provided by
the foreign NGOs are welcome.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Russian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov here Monday afternoon
and discussed bilateral ties, international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said his talks with President Boris Yeltsin went on well,
and the two sides would jointly release two statements and a press
communique on the wide-ranging consensus they have reached.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said exchange of visits by Russian and Chinese leaders
has pushed ahead bilateral relations forcefully.
</P>
<P>
He believed Jiang's ongoing visit would be an important
milestone in the development of the Russian-Chinese relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Chinese and Russian heads of state vowed two years
ago to build a strategic partnership, and the decision since has
proven to be a historic one.
</P>
<P>
As it is non-aligned, non-confrontational and not targeting any
third country, the Chinese president said, the new Sino-Russian
relationship complies fully with the current and long-term
interests of the two peoples, and accords with the evolving trend
of international relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Russian relationship is moving forward smoothly along
a pre-determined track. China is willing to work together with
Russia to move bilateral cooperation in every field into the new
century," the Chinese president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang held that there are great potentials for expanding trade
and economic cooperation between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that as both of our countries are
changing toward market economies, we should abide by rules of the
market under the current new conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both governments should create favorable environment for
businesses of the two countries to work together, and encourage
cooperation on provincial basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believed "there also exists a promising future for
cooperation in the high-tech sector," adding that with unremitting
efforts, economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
would be enhanced over time.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has attached great importance to
the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is scheduled to visit Russia in
spring next year to hold the fourth regular meeting between
premiers of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes the sub-committees of the two sides make
preparation for the meeting as early as possible to make it
fruitful, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said smooth development of bilateral relations is very
important, and it not only concerns the future of the two
countries, but also peace and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
Russia highly values its strategic partnership with China, and
is satisfied with the development of friendly cooperation between
the two countries, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia has adopted a positive attitude toward the
development of bilateral economic and trade relations, and it
would take measures to boost cooperation and exchange of personnel
in economy and trade, energy, aviation and military technology.
</P>
<P>
Primakov hoped the two governments would reach accords on these
fields during Zhu's visit next spring.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reiterated Russia's commitment to the one-China
policy, saying that Russia's stand on the issue of Taiwan was firm
in the past, and it still is and will not be changed in the future.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Jiang said the world is undergoing
fundamental changes and the trend of multipolarization is evolving.
</P>
<P>
"China holds that it is the cornerstone for the healthy
development of the multipolarization that all countries should
follow strictly the goals and principles of the United Nations
Charter, and act strictly in line with international norms and the
five principles of peaceful co-existence in developing relations
with other countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also the guarantee for establishing a just and
reasonable new order of international politics and economy, and
for safeguarding the world peace and stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
The diversity of the world is not only reflected in politics
and cultures, but also in economies, Jiang said, adding that
economic globalization does not mean in the least that every
country should follow the same development path.
</P>
<P>
Noting that economic globalization can promote international
economic exchanges and cooperation, he called for alert against
negative effects it could bring along.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia financial crisis has caused severe losses to
countries affected, and it has hit the world economy," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has demonstrated that countries, especially
developing countries, are facing new challenges in securing their
economic stability, guarding against financial risks and
maintaining economic security," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to further adjust and improve the existing
international economic and financial order, especially by
strengthening regulatory mechanisms to check against excessive
speculation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also noted that China is firmly against meddling into
other countries' internal affairs and imposing wishes on others in
international relations.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Expects Quick End to Standstill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Monday that he does not expect the present
standstill in efforts to settle the Cyprus problem will continue
for long.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a conference, titled Cyprus: a Regional
Business Center, held in London, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we are at the moment at a situation of
standstill, which I do not expect to last for very long,"
Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the present impasse was created after Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash attempted unilaterally to change the
basis of negotiations, which were laid down by the high level
agreements of 1977 and 1979 based on Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions provided that a solution in Cyprus "must be
based on a bicommunal, bizonal federal republic, with one single
sovereignty, single international personality and a single
citizenship," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Denktash wants to create a very loose
confederation with two separate sovereign states, one with Turkey
and the other with Greece.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose this idea because it abolishes the independence of
Cyprus and creates a Turkish protectorate in the north and a
Greek protectorate in the south," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
However, he underlined that this attempt by the Turkish side to
delay the negotiating process has not found any international
response neither from the European Union (EU), nor from the
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council or the Non-Aligned
Movement countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island,
whose north is controlled by Turkish Cypriots and north dominated
by Greek Cypriots, under a bizonal, bicommunal federation
formula. But no tangible results have been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Clerides reiterated, "it is our policy and we have declared it
that we are seeking a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem
through the good offices of the U.N. Secretary-General (Kofi
Annan) as provided by Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that these positions have the support of the
Security Council, the EU and the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore there is no reason to worry about the events
which will take place in the near future or in the future
of Cyprus," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
The London conference, organized by the Cyprus Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, and the Confederation of British Industry,
aimed at encouraging investments in Cyprus.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Monday that as China and Russia are exploring new areas
of cooperation, there lies a promising future for their local
governments to work together.
</P>
<P>
In meeting Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the Russian Federal
Council, the upper house of parliament, Jiang said Chinese
provinces and Russian regions are no longer satisfied with just
talking about friendship, rather, they have started to explore
practical ways of mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Truly active local cooperation will make the steps of bilateral
cooperation more sound and its foundations more solid, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev expressed his warm welcome to Jiang's visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his China tour last year, Stroyev said Russia and
China built friendly relations of mutual respect long ago and that
Jiang's ongoing visit would further promote such relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, here since Sunday evening on a four-day visit, held an
informal summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the
Central Clinical Hospital earlier Monday. Yeltsin was hospitalized
for pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the Sino-Russian strategic
partnership has evolved smoothly since it was forged in 1996 and
is now steady steps ahead into the new century.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that his trip to Novosibirsk in west central Russia on
Tuesday will enable the government and people of Novosibirsk to
know more about China and further promote local exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Continue to Seize West Bank Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers continued to
seize lands in the West Bank Monday in the attempt to prevent them
being transferred to the Palestinians by Israel as called upon by
a recent land-for-peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Settlers from Elon Moreh settlement in Samaria, in the northern
part of the West Bank, established a new outpost on a nearby
hilltop, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Driving a bus which was used as mobile house with a generator to
provide electricity, they vowed to stay on the hilltop for some
time, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The civil administration of the Israeli army in the West Bank
said the settlers' move was illegal and they should be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest in a string of land-grabbing activities by
Jewish settlers in the West Bank which intensified before and
after Israel started the first stage of a three-phase troop
redeployment last Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Jewish settlers from another settlement in Samaria
took over and planted an Israeli flag atop a deserted railway
station at the Palestinian town of Sabastiya, where the settlement
campaign in the West Bank was first launched in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
They refused to leave until Israel's Defense Ministry promised
to "seriously consider" allowing a permanent Jewish presence there.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authority allowed them to establish a religious
school, a museum, and a center for the study of the settlement
movement at the railway station, the settlers said.
</P>
<P>
Fresh tensions in the West Bank were also ignited by Israel's
expropriation of Palestinian lands to build bypass roads for Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Israel planned to complete a dozen new roads, half of them
already under construction, in the West Bank by the end of the
further troop withdrawal early next year.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that these roads are a security lifeline for Jewish
settlers living in West Bank communities, which will become
isolated after Israeli pullout that will leave 40 percent of the
West Bank under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinians said the bypass road is aimed at destroying
geographical continuity of Palestinian territories and thus
defeating hopes for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Also in the West Bank Monday, Israeli soldiers patrolling
outside a Palestinian town near Hebron fired rubber bullets at
Palestinian stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said 15 Palestinian students were injured
in the clashes. Two Palestinian policemen were also hurt when
they tried to break up the confrontation.

to expand trade with Kuwait, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Fight Hunger Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of
Agriculture and Cooperatives William Kusila Monday urged African
states to join hands in fighting hunger.
</P>
<P>
Kusila made the remarks while opening a two-day conference for
the Coalition of African Organization for Food Security, Trade
and Sustainable Development (COASAD) in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of hunger and starvation on our continent can be
and must be overcome provided we put in place appropriate
institutions to serve as instruments to accomplish our
objectives," said the Tanzanian minister.
</P>
<P>
The idea to form COASAD was hatched in 1996 at the World Food
Summit and the World Forum of Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs) in Rome to tackle problems of hunger, malnutrition and
poverty which are prevalent in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The Rome assembly brought together 112 African organizations
from 25 African countries, and Tanzania was elected as the
coordinator of the COASAD initiative in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
"COASAD has to be able to come up with sound strategies to
break the poverty and hunger gridlock and translate our common
dreams and visions into real life processes that can secure food
security at household, community, national and continental
levels," said Kusila.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference held in New Africa Hotel, member
organizations will hold a constitutional conference and after
deliberations adopt the constitution and thereby officially form
COASAD.
</P>
<P>
Following the conference, a newly-formed COASAD will open its
meeting to public participation and discussion of the key issues
of sustainable food security and trade Wednesday.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin said here Monday that the two
countries will optimize the mechanism of regular exchange of
visits between their leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released after their sixth summit, the two

dialogue at all levels, particularly at the top, will have a very
important bearing on the growth of the Sino-Russian strategic

issues by making full use of the "hot-line" phone link between
them and by exchange of correspondence, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state have decided to hold their seventh
summit meeting in China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the efforts to optimize the mechanism of
regular exchange of visits, the premiers of the two countries are
scheduled to hold their fourth meeting in the spring of 1999 in
Moscow, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the meeting a fruitful one, both sides will
make good preparation in all areas, by implementing their previous
agreements on trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They will work to diversify economic and trade cooperation and
take on new forms of cooperation and in line with international
norms, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also prioritize large- and medium-sized
cooperation projects, so as to boost local economic exchanges.

Authorities of the two countries will continue to join hands in
combating all kinds of organized crimes, including the trafficking
of illegal drugs and narcotics, smuggling and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
They will also step up efforts to contain national separatism
and religious extremism.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that the two countries will
faithfully carry out their two agreements on confidence-building
in the military area and on reducing military presence along their
common border.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also continue high-level and in-depth
consultations on all areas of security guarantees.

Both sides hold that the five-nation summit meeting held in
Alma Ata on July 3, 1998, and the joint statement released on the
occasion have opened bright prospects for strengthening security
and cooperation in Central Asia, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two countries place a high priority on
the expansion and regulation of their non-governmental contacts
and exchanges, and are willing to work for better mutual
understanding of each other's history, culture, tradition and
customs as well as current status.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also support and encourage the efforts made
by various social bodies and news media to present true images of
Sino-Russian friendship, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have committed themselves to the faith of
peace, justice and cooperation, and pledged to work accordingly
for acquiring physical, political, legal and other guarantees in
the 21st century and the build-up of a new world order free of
war, oppression, destruction and violence.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the two countries hope to facilitate an overall

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank, Bankers Trust in Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Deutsche Bank and
the U.S. Bankers Trust announced Monday that they are "in advanced
stages" of merger talks which could lead to the creation of the
world's largest bank in terms of assets.
</P>
<P>
The proposed combination, costing more than 9 billion U.S.
dollars, "would create a truly compelling global financial
services company," Deutsche Bank Chairman Rolf Breuer was quoted
as saying in a joint statement issued by the banks here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Separate board meetings are scheduled for November 29 when "the
parties expect to obtain final approval of a definitive
agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, would have an opportunity to
build an investment banking presence in the U.S. through the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Bankers Trust is the eighth largest bank in
the U.S. It is trying to enhance its financial base to better
compete with other banks.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the deal would mark the largest takeover of a
U.S. banking company by a foreign firm.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust have a combined asset of 843
billion U.S. dollars, topping the world list.
</P>
<P>
The next largest banks include Switzerland's UBS with assets at
789 billion dollars, U.S. Citigroup at 703 billion dollars and
Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi at 653 billion dollars,
according to the Wall Street Journal.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel to Facilitate Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and Israeli officials
on Monday decided to establish mechanisms to facilitate bilateral
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was spelled out in a joint statement issued here
after a meeting between Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal
and visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon as well as
Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to form a bilateral institution to
launch joint projects in the fields of industry, tourism,
agriculture, communication, transport and water.
</P>
<P>
They also planned to establish a trilateral committee, which
involves Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians, to facilitate the
flow of commodities among them, especially from Jordan to the
Palestinian self-rule areas, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharansky and his Jordanian counterpart Mohammad
Saleh Hourani signed a letter which called on the United States to
support the establishment of more qualified industrial zones in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Commodities co-produced by Jordan and Israel in such industrial
zone can be exported to the U.S. duty free. There is one such zone
in Jordan now.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to discuss some vital issues soon,
particularly those about water resources, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Both sides welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal reached
in Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
They expected the deal, now being implemented by the two sides,
to help boost regional cooperation for the benefit of Jordan,
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Sharon arrived here earlier Monday on a brief visit. His
delegation arrived here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. But
bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and other fields paced
slowly in the past years, as a result of the deadlocked Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan finds it difficult to break Israel's monopoly of the
Palestinian markets in its attempt to export its products to the
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Vote for Beef Export Ban Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Most of European Union member
states voted Monday for the lifting of the export ban on British
beef but the actual lift will not be implemented until next March.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture ministers from 10 of the 15 member states voted for
the lifting of the two-year-and-a-half-old ban whereas Germany
voted against and Austria, Spain, France and Luxembourg abstained
from it.
</P>
<P>
The vote, however, is enough to have the ban lifted after the
European Commission conducts some final checks to see whether the
control measures Britain has taken are in place.
</P>
<P>
The commission, that initiated the lifting of the ban after
consulting its scientific and veterinarian committees, will look
into the case again soon.
</P>
<P>
Britain will be able to resume exporting beef under a
date-based export scheme (DBES) and only de-boned beef and beef
products from cattle born after August 1, 1996 and between the
ages of six and 30 months old at the time of slaughter can be
exported.
</P>
<P>
Potentially-contaminated animal feed was believed to have been
removed from British farms after August 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed on British beef on March 20, 1996 after a
link was established by British scientists between the mad cow
disease and the Creutzfeld Jacob disease, or a human form of the
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
In Britain alone, 28 people have died of the Creutzfeld Jacob
disease so far and upwards of 175,000 cattle have been found with
the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the ban, Britain exported 270,000 tons of beef and
beef products in 1995 for more than 1 billion U.S. dollars but
observers here believe that Britain needs time to re-build its
overseas market that formerly reached as far as South Africa and
Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Special Fund for Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said
Monday that it was considering setting aside a special fund for
hurricane-struck Central America.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the 15-nation union discussed the fund
initiative during their one-day council meeting. They also
discussed alleviating the repayment of debts by Central American
countries.
</P>
<P>
The council did not say how much would be put aside in the fund
but sources close to the council meeting said that the sum could
be 100 million ECU (110 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union and the European Commission put together an
emergency aid of 101.8 million ECU (111.98 million dollars) for
Central America that fell prey to Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
The European Union aid will cover food aid and rehabilitation
in Central America, where the hurricane claimed a toll of more
than 10,000 people and left 3 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch triggered floods and mudslides that raked havoc
with the Central American countries, especially in Honduras and
Nicaragua that had appealed for international creditors to write
off 11 billion dollars in debt owed by the two countries whose
economies have been ruined by the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Improve Waste Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 23 (Xinhua) - African states should
develop appropriate policy frameworks, strategies and skills to
curb the worsening waste management situation, a senior Tanzanian
official said at a workshop here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Ngumbullu, the Permanent Secretary in the
Vice-President's Office, told participants from Ethiopia, Uganda
and Tanzania that there is an urgent need to train professionals
to safeguard the health, productivity and quality of life in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the planning process for solid waste
programs should focus on choosing appropriate technology in
mitigating solid waste in a cost effective manner.
</P>
<P>
"Spending on inappropriate technology will put burdens of
clean-up efforts on future generations," the permanent secretary
said, stressing a great awareness and active participation of
policy makers, businessmen and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Ngumbullu said that the increasing amount of waste in Africa
is a direct result of a growing urban population, the changing
pattern of production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"Liquid and solid waste emanating from residential, commercial
and industrial areas are polluting water resources, air and
endangering human health in short and long terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngumbullu said that traditional methods of dealing with waste
have not been very successful and therefore there is a need to
take up mitigation programs such as reclamation and discharges
control to the ground and water.
</P>
<P>
"Preventive and strict measures should be put in place with
periodical environmental auditing," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Gains in Asia overnight and
Wall Street's positive close last Friday underpinned sharp gains
in Europe Monday.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 finished 130.9 points, or 2.3 percent,
higher at 5,848.4, just short of its session best of 5,854.4.
</P>
<P>
The index has already jumped 243 points in the last two
sessions. It became even more bullish following the news that
Deutsche Bank was in advanced talks with U.S. investment bank
Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's Dax finished 107.24 points higher at 5,019.12.
However, Analysts warned that the gains may not be sustainable.
</P>
<P>
"The market is a bit exaggerated," said Erhard Schmitt of
Helaba Trust in Frankfurt, and his statement reflected a growing
consensus among analysts.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector continued to lag behind the rest of the
market as uncertainty about the details of the German government's
plan to impose an "energy tax" made investors wary.
</P>
<P>
French shares moved ahead, with help from banking shares amid
talk of mergers and takeovers. And the Cac 40 finished 43.11
points higher at 3,845.81.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Confidant Pleads Not Guilty to Whitewater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's confidant Webster Hubbell, a former top Justice
Department official, pleaded not guilty on Monday to 15 new
federal charges stemming from the 1970s Arkansas land deal known
as Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not guilty," Hubbell said when U.S. District Judge James
Robertson asked him to enter his plea to the charges handed up by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell, a friend of Clinton and a former law partner of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, had already served 18 months in prison
after pleading guilty in another Whitewater-related case.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Starr secured an indictment against Hubbell on
tax-evasion charges earlier this year but the indictment was
thrown out by Robertson on ground that Starr went beyond his
jurisdiction as independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell's attorney, John Nields, said he planned to try to have
six of the current charges dismissed, maintaining they were
covered under a 1994 plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nields also said he and another lawyer on Hubbell's team might
testify as defense witnesses and suggested a third lawyer might be
brought into the case.
</P>
<P>
Defense motions were to be filed with the court by January 11,
and prosecutors were given 20 days beyond that to file their
motions. The judge said the trial was likely to begin in March.
</P>
<P>
The current indictment charged Hubbell with fraud, perjury and
impeding a probe by two federal agencies in their investigation of
the Clintons' involvement in Castle Grande, a failed real estate
development in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Starr, who is appealing dismissal of the tax-evasion case, has
long been seen by some analysts as trying to squeeze Hubbell in an
effort to get him to testify against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
Starr's investigation of the possibility that Hubbell was paid
large amounts of money for work not done just to keep him quiet
indirectly led to the independent prosecutor looking into the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell has known the Clintons since the Clinton was governor
of Arkansas and Mrs. Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm in Little
Rock. He came to Washington when Clinton was elected president and
took the No. 3 job in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
When indicted this time, Hubbell said if Starr's intent was to
get him to tell something incriminating about the Clintons, he
would fail.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any wrongdoing by the first lady or the
president," he said at the time. "Nothing the independent counsel
can do to me is going to make me lie about them."

<HEADLINE> Algeria Urges Halt To Oil Price Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Algeria on Monday urged the
member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to define their floor production to stem the stagnant oil
price from dipping further.
</P>
<P>
"The OPEC is in need of a unanimity that preserves the
interests of the oil producing countries," said Abdul-Aziz Sab'e,
spokesman of the Algerian Foreign Ministry at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Aziz Sab'e pointed out that Algeria has always played a
leading role in reflecting the common stand of the OPEC member
states.
</P>
<P>
"Algerian President Liamine Zeroual sent special envoys to the
heads of states of the OPEC members with messages related to the
coming OPEC meeting," Sab'e said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming OPEC meeting, scheduled for November 25 in the
Austrian capital of Vienna, comes at a time when the oil price hit
less than 12 U.S. dollars per barrel, the lowest in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts here partially attributed the decline of oil prices to
a daily surplus of 2 million barrels of the OPEC members since
last January, which has led to a huge oil stock.
</P>
<P>
Lower demands resulting from financial crisis in southeast Asia
and the moderate winter also dampened the flagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC has twice this year brought down the oil production of
its member states, but the oil price in the world market moved
little upward.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Civil Servants Put Deadline for Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civil servants
representatives Monday gave the government the deadline of
November 30 to respond to their demands for salary and allowances
review, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There are about 170,000 civil servants, constituting the
majority of employees in Zimbabwe. The civil servants are
demanding a 20-percent interim adjustment to their salaries.
</P>
<P>
President of the Public Service Association Givemore
Masongorera said the civil servants, like any other workers, also
needed to be cushioned against the escalating prices of basic
commodities, triggered by a recent 68 percent fuel increase.
</P>
<P>
He said the civil servants were also entitled to join the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU)-organized strikes called
for every Wednesday, because they were the worst paid in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"People are saying enough is enough and civil servants reserve
the right to engage in such protests to have their grievances
corrected," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Opposition United Parties said the
government should work together with the ZCTU to bring to an end
the current deadlock between the two parties over wage increases.
</P>
<P>
Spokesperson of the party Edson Chiwara said in Harare that it
was time President Robert Mugabe put more effort in solving
problems in the country instead of traveling around the world,
solving problems of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Employment Council for the Mining
Industry has agreed on the 20 percent cost of living wage
adjustments for its workers with effect from December 1.

<HEADLINE> There Is Still No Cure to AIDS, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday said that "there is still no cure" to AIDS,
despite some reports saying that better medicines have been found.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the World AIDS Day, which falls on December
1, Annan said, "Some would have us believe that because better
medicines have been found, the AIDS emergency is over. The facts
tell us otherwise. There is still no cure. The advance of HIV has
not been stopped in any country."
</P>
<P>
Even in Western Europe and North America, around 75,000 people
were infected last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this month, the number of adults and children
living with HIV will exceed 33 million -- 10 percent more than a
year ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Aids has already taken 14 million lives," he said, "At least
95 percent of all infections and deaths occur in the developing
world, where the costly new medicines that can help prolong lives
are scarcely available or affordable."
</P>
<P>
So the truth is that AIDS is still an emerging epidemic -- one
that is killing more people every year than malaria, he said,
"Because the victims are mostly young adults, who would otherwise
be raising families and supporting the economy, the repercussions
are reaching crisis level."
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere is this truer than in sub-Saharan Africa, where 34
million people have been infected and 11.5 million have died since
the epidemic began," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The tidal wave risks wiping out the hard-won gains of poorer
nations," he said, adding that in Botswana, a child born early in
the next decade can expect to live just past 40 -- instead of 70
in the absence of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe estimates that by the year 2005, it will have more
than 90,000 AIDS orphans under 15, he said, adding that a major
company in the United Republic of Tanzania says its costs due to
AIDS exceeded its total profits for the year.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the broad-based struggle against the epidemic
carried out by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS is
vital," he said, "Perhaps, the most important message the United
Nations system can convey is that we are not powerless against the
epidemic."
</P>
<P>
"Experience tells us that prevention efforts are especially
likely to pay off among young people, by teaching them to adopt
safe behavior from the start," he said, "Around half of all HIV
infections occur in young people aged 15-24."
</P>
<P>
Through the 1998 "Force for Change" campaign, the United
Nations and its partners have highlighted the role that young
people can play in changing the course of the epidemic, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Young people are a powerful influence for education and
understanding in their families, their peer groups, their schools,
their communities and their countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Enlargement Should Open to South: Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema said on Tuesday that the ongoing European Union
enlargement should further to include such south European
countries as Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The visiting prime minister told the press after meeting with
European Commission President Jacques Santer that the enlargement
process should be as open as it should be gradual.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of both the European Union and Italy to
include these important countries to help secure one of the
troubled areas in Europe," added D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Italy had campaigned to include Romania in the first wave of
enlargement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which later
chose Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The European Union decided late last year to start accession
talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia
and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Also applying for EU membership are Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia,
Lithuania, Slovakia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
EU enlargement negotiations went underway in March this year
and were upgraded to foreign ministerial level in early November.

<HEADLINE> Italy Gets EU Support on Ocalan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
consider retaliatory measures if Turkey implements the boycott on
Italy's goods and services, the top EU official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation EU, made the remarks when meeting
with visiting Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
"The boycott on Italian goods and services would be a breach of
the association agreement and the customer union agreement," said
the commission chief.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements, signed in 1963 and 1995 respectively, guide
the trade relations between the EU and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Santer expressed great concern to D'Alema over the situation
between Italy and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that his country is in an awkward situation, D'Alema
said Italy would not back off for a soft solution.
</P>
<P>
Problems arose after Italy decided not to extradite Abdullah
Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader detained in Italy, to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on the grounds that the Italian
constitution forbids the extradition of a suspect to a country
where the death penalty is still in force.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, viewed as a terrorist in Turkey, leads the Kurdistan
Workers Party that is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey threatened to boycott Italian goods and services
including television broadcast programs and defense industry
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Turkey would not invite a single Italian company to bid for
defense contracts, said the Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Augusta firm was reportedly in the running for a
3.5-billion-U.S. dollar contract to build attack helicopters for
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
An EU commission spokesperson said that the commission would
try to solve the boycott issue through dialogue and arbitration
before considering possible retaliatory measures.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Patch Up Israeli-Swiss Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will pay an official working visit Wednesday to
Switzerland in a bid to patch up the two countries' political
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Such relationship went somewhat sour after Netanyahu last week
attended a ceremony in Jerusalem honoring U.S. Senator Alfonse
d'Amato and three other Americans who helped force Swiss banks
into a 1.25 billion-dollar settlement.
</P>
<P>
Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova said last week that
Netanyahu's attendance at the award ceremony "casts a shadow" over
his Switzerland visit on November 25.
</P>
<P>
Many Swiss see D'Amato and the other three Americans receiving
the "conscience and courage" award as Swiss-bashers. Netanyahu's
presence at the ceremony triggered public calls from some senior
Swiss politicians not to extend an invitation to him.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister is scheduled to begin his visit by
attending the Swiss-Israeli economic forum, organized by the Swiss
Office for Trade Promotion in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
He will then go to the Swiss capital of Berne to meet with
Swiss President Flavio Cotti, Defense Minister Adolf Ogi and
Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions will cover the subjects of bilateral
relations, the Middle East peace process, and economic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to avoid double taxation between Israel and
Switzerland will be signed during Netanyahu's visit.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India Ready for Local Polls in Tight Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 75 million Indians are
going to polling stations Wednesday amid tight security to decide
the fate of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the
Congress, the main opposition party, in four state assemblies and
on 12 assembly seats in six other states.
</P>
<P>
The fierce contest for the 626 assembly seats in Madhya
Pradesh, Delhi, Mizoram and Rajasthan is seen as a major test of
the popularity of both the BJP-led government and the Congress,
which is seeking to rejuvenate itself under the leadership of
Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
The voters will elect 320 members of the assembly in Madhya
Pradesh, 69 in Delhi, 197 in Rajasthan and 40 in Mizoram from a
total of 4,968 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Observers here see Wednesday's polls as crucial for the Indian
coalition led by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, already
troubled by ebullient alliance partners, because defeat for the
BJP might lead to realignment of political forces in the country,
making the eight-month-old government unstable.
</P>
<P>
Tight security arrangements have been made in the four states
with seal of borders and deployment of tens of thousands of police
and security personnel, para-military forces and home guards to
ensure the smooth conduct of the elections.
</P>
<P>
In BJP-ruled Delhi, where 180 out of the 9,128 polling stations
have been identified as sensitive by the Election Commission, 267
companies of police, 30 companies of para-military forces and
8,000 home guards are scheduled to be deployed on the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the anti-incumbency factor, coupled with
people's anger over price rises and the dismal performance of the
Delhi government, is likely to play a crucial role in deciding the
poll outcome.
</P>
<P>
In Rajasthan, a stronghold of the BJP, more than 78,000
security personnel including 140 companies of police from the
central security forces and several neighboring states have been
deployed at 40,686 polling stations with 5,432 identified as
sensitive, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Congress is in an upbeat mood after its success in
elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian
parliament, in the state earlier this year and hopes to stage a
comeback after being out of power for eight years.
</P>
<P>
In the Congress-ruled central state of Madhya, the BJP is
contesting all the 320 seats while the Congress has fielded
candidates in 316 constituencies, leaving two for its electoral
ally and another two for Congress-backed independents.
</P>
<P>
Inter-state borders have been sealed to prevent infiltration of
anti-social elements from neighboring states as around 25 percent
out of the 56,834 polling stations have been identified as
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
In the northeast state of Mizoram, also ruled by the Congress,
14 companies of additional central para-military forces have been
brought from outside the state for deployment along the border and
in outside areas to maintain law and order, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
During the month-long campaign for the assembly polls, the
Congress accused the BJP of failing on all fronts and laid the
blame of crime rise and economic slowdown, particularly the price
rises, on the BJP rule while the BJP said the previous governments
led by the Congress should bear the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
In an election manifesto for the four states released on
November 13, the Congress said the BJP regime had descended into
the vortex of deepening economic disaster leading to skyrocketing
prices and a stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, at the receiving end of the opposition onslaught,
raked up a number of issues of the past including the imposition
of emergency, and anti-Sikh riots in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Discuss China's Role in AIDS Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Gro Brundtland,
director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), today
expresssed hope that China will become a role model to help
developing countries curb serious epidemics of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
China, a nation with a quarter of the world's population, can
contribute greatly to the global fight against the AIDS epidemic
and help to successfully avoid a public health disaster resulting
from the disease, according to Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 Chinese are reportedly infected by HIV mainly due
to the rampant intravenous drug use and sharing contaminated
needles, as well as the rising incidence of sexually transmitted
diseases and unsafe blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that a possible massive outbreak is just around
the corner if preventive measures are not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
"China will be confronted by an AIDS situation as serious as in
India and Thailand today if we fail in prevention and control
efforts," according to Minister of Health (MOH) Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the MOH operates under close government scrutiny and
has decided to strengthen education, stipulate regulations and
develop new drugs and vaccines. The State Council, China's highest
governing body, is also preparing to release medium- and long-term
action plans for HIV/AIDS control.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS education will be targeted at youngsters, government
employees and medical professionals," according to comments Zhang
made during a meeting with Brundtland earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
A series of policies and regulations protecting the rights and
interests of AIDS patients, as well as a promotional campaign on
preventive measures will also be introduced in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official exhibited special interest in China's research
of vaccines and drugs made with traditional Chinese medicine. She
noted that related efforts deserve strong support since "no one
knows where or when a breakthrough will take place".
</P>
<P>
She said WHO will continue cooperation with China in the
field. "WHO is prepared to further support the government in the
development of HIV surveillance, the management of sexually
transmitted diseases, blood safety, and providing training on
adolescent sexual and reproductive health," according to
Brundtland's comments in a Monday speech at Beijing Medical
University.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and the U.S. signed a
scientific agreement Tuesday to enable Cyprus to participate in an
international environmental science and education program.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here by Cypriot Education and Culture
Minister Lykourgos Kappas and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth
Brill.
</P>
<P>
The program, known as the Global Learning and Observations to
Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program, brings students, teachers
and scientists together to study the global environment.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the program are to intensify students'
awareness of global environment, increase their scientific
understanding of the earth and support improved students'
achievement in science and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Brill said Cyprus is the
74th country to join the GLOBE program, which was initiated by
U.S. Vice President Al Gore in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Through this agreement, Cypriot students will be helping
scientists by taking a regular set of environmental measurements
at their schools and reporting their data via the Internet,"
Brill said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kappas stressed that environmental education
represents a permanent target of education in Cyprus and is an
integral part of the National Action Plan for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
He said six schools from all over the island will be involved
in the program. Cypriot ministry of education and culture will
offer every possible support and assistance for the implementation

<HEADLINE> China Reforms Higher Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Education Chen
Zhili recently announced the introduction of overall reform to
China's higher education system.
</P>
<P>
Chen also noted that the Law on Higher Education will
guarantee and guide the reform.
</P>
<P>
He said that 648 institutions of higher education have adjusted
management and a new management system is emerging under which the
institutions are jointly run by the central and local governments,
with the latter assuming major responsibility.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the introduction of college tuition has been
completed, and college graduates are now assuming greater
responsibility for finding employment.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty-stricken students will receive scholarship and loan
applications forms along with notices of admission and
institutions or local governments will pay travel expenses if
necessary," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising activities continue to be a nuisance for many
university presidents. The Law on Higher Education stipulates that
higher education will primarily be funded by fiscal allocations,
with supplementary coming from various other channels. Chen
expressed his welcome to any form of financial assistance for
higher education in China.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has more than 1,000 private
institutions, with related institution mushrooming in big
cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The
State Council has issued related regulations, and private schools
are playing an increasingly important role in China's system of
higher education.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Sign Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia here on
Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote
nuclear cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked at the end of a visit to Iran by
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov who arrived here
Saturday, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The MOU envisions formation of joint research groups for
adding a second unit to the Bushehr nuclear power plant in
southern Iran and building new generation nuclear power plants
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bushehr nuclear plant is under construction with Russia's
assistance under the terms of a contract concluded in 1994 between
Tehran and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the signing of MOU, Iranian Vice President Gholamreza
Aqazadeh said more than 1,000 people, including 300 Russians, are
currently working on the Bushehr, and the construction of the
plant is expected to be completed in 52 months,
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh, who is also head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization
 (IAEO), disclosed that the construction of the metal chamber of
the plant has been finished while the concrete chamber is due to
be completed within a few months.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the delay in the construction of the plant, he
said that the main reasons are "certain ambiguities" in the
contract with Russia and the delay by Iran in submitting some
necessary technical documents to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The construction work has picked up considerably after the
problems were finally solved last September when the two sides
reached an addendum agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made special arrangements with Russians to pay part of
its dues for the project by exporting various goods, including 15
million U.S. dollars worth of buses and automobiles to Russia.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Fair Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Matsushita
Battery Company, which produces AA batteries under the trademark
National, recently discovered that counterfeits of its products
have entered the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Matsushita filed a lawsuit against the trademark
violator under the Unfair Competition Law and eventually won
the case.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 unfair competition cases have been filed in
China over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's administrative departments for
industry and commerce have collected fines totalling 820 million
yuan (100 million US dollars) since the Unfair Competition Law
took effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The law represents an important milestone in China's economic
history and indicates that the country has established basic rules
governing its economic sector, said Wang Zhongfu, director of the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Wang made the
comments today at a conference marking the fifth anniversary
of the implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises from both at home and abroad once subjected to
unfair competition have benefitted greatly from the law, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The law is playing a vital role in encouraging and maintaining
fair competition in spite of the irregularities in the domestic
market, said Shao Gang, vice general manager of the Beijing
Tongrentang Co., a well-known Chinese pharmaceutical
manufacturer.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is a tentative
translation of the full text of the joint press communique, issued
here Tuesday, on the informal meeting between Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin:
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Russian President Boris Nikolayevich
Yeltsin, Chinese President Jiang Zemin is on a visit to Russia
from November 22 to 25.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held their first informal meeting on November
23. The successful meeting indicated that through regular contacts
between leaders of the two countries, their mutual understanding
and trust have reached a new level.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin also met Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov, Federation Council Chairman Yegor
Semeonovich Stroyev and State Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev.
</P>
<P>
In the joint communique on the meeting results, both sides
emphasized that at the sixth Chinese-Russian summit, they not only
coordinated their positions on the basic trend of development of
the international community at the turn of century, but also
reached agreements on the long term strategic prospects on further
promoting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin and Yeltsin pointed out with pleasure that the
Chinese-Russian relation is enjoying a stable development along
the track of equality, trust and strategic partnership of
cooperation oriented toward the 21st century established in 1996,
and stressed that they made the choice after considering the
historical experience in bilateral relations and current world
situation, and on the basis of common understanding of bilateral
cooperation prospects and international development.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders confirmed the completion of all field
operations of the delimitation work on the west section of the
border between the two countries, which is conducted under the
Chinese-Russia west border section pact signed on September 3,
1994. Thus the east and west border sections between China and
Russia for the first time in the history have been clearly
delimitated in the field. The two countries have established a new
model for border security in the Asian continent, which means not
only border delimitation, but also reduction of military forces
in the border regions, creation of confidence-building measures
and enhancement of military transparency.
</P>
<P>
They also reached a series of important agreements on the
specifics of bilateral relations through the meetings.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that it was necessary to take coordinative and
significant steps to strengthen the organization and management of
Chinese-Russian trade and economic cooperations, and improve
monetary and legal conditions for such cooperations. They
instructed the committee responsible for regular meeting of the
two premiers and all sub-committees to convene regular meetings at
the end of this year or beginning of next year to examine problems
in cooperation in various fields and submit the results and
suggestion of their meetings to the fourth regular meeting between
the two premier for consideration in the spring of 1999 in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side agreed to Russia's proposal to discuss issues
of exchanges of citizens of both countries as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Exports Jute, Jute Goods to 80 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is now exporting jute
and jute products to 80 countries and regions across the world,
State Minister for Jute A.K. Faizul Huq said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some other countries had shown interest in purchasing jute and
jute goods from Bangladesh, Huq told the Jatiya Sangsad, the
country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The country had made relentless efforts by taking part in
international trade fairs and conferences, sending jute
delegations abroad and inviting representatives from jute-buying
countries to Dhaka to create new markets and expand the present
export level, he said.
</P>
<P>
To increase its jute exports, the government had a plan to
explore new markets and establish new links in the world market,
said the state minister.
</P>
<P>
The country's jute sector earned 11 billion taka (229 million
U.S. dollars) from exports of jute and jute products during the
1997-1998 financial year ending June 30, he said.
</P>
<P>
Once the largest foreign exchange earner of the country,
Bangladesh's jute sector has shrunk considerably in recent years,
giving way to the booming ready-made garments industry.

</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to begin in the near future the registration
of diplomatic real estate of the Russian embassy in Beijing and
consulate general in Shanghai as well as the Chinese embassy in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China gains the ownership of the
housing of the Chinese consulate general in St. Petersburg, Russia
will provide necessary assistance to the registration.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to accelerate negotiations on the
house properties of other diplomatic establishments between them.
</P>
<P>
Russia reiterated its consistent position on the Taiwan issue,
namely, the government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legal government of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
Standing on that principled position, Russia gives no backing
to concepts of "independence of Taiwan" in any form, supports the
stand of the People's Republic of China against "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan", and opposes the admission of Taiwan into
the United Nations and other international organizations that only
sovereign states have the right to join.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation reiterated that it will sell no weapons
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China expressed its heartfelt gratitude to Russia for the
principle of "one China" it has consistently upheld. In return,
China holds no objection to unofficial connections between Russia
and Taiwan in sectors like economy and trade, science and
technology, culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
China reiterated that it is in full support of the unity and
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on the international
situation in a deep-going way and on further strengthening of
cooperation between the two nations in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that they have identical or similar positions
on situations in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf region and the
Asia-Pacific region, effects of the Asian financial crisis,
situation in South Asia, reform of the U.N. Security Council and
other pressing international issues.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to reinforce consultations on international issues
in a view to coordinating their positions.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to improve the dialogue mechanism at all
levels, particularly at the high level, between the two
nations. For this, they will fully use the secret direct telephone
line between Beijing and Moscow to exchange views on important
issues.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin invited President Boris Nikolayevich
Yeltsin to visit China in 1999 for the seventh summit between them.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin accepted the invitation and expressed
his gratitude for it.
</P>
<P>
The exact date for the visit will be decided through diplomatic
consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China is now an important
factor in stabilizing economy in Asia and the world
as a whole, the international community and the world public opinion
have said.
</P>
<P>
China's sustained economic development and its commitment of
maintaining the stability of the value of Chinese currency yuan
have won universal praise from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The country has formed an all-facet pattern in using overseas
fund and in economic cooperation after two decades of reform and
opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
the State Council, China's highest governing body, decided to
grant the coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces preferential
policies and measures for their economic activities in 1979.
</P>
<P>
One year later, the country set up special economic zones in
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 14 coastal cities and the Pearl River Delta were
opened to overseas investors. Pudong New Area in Shanghai adopted
a series of reform measures as from early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has opened 1,194 counties and cities and 222
ports to overseas visitors and investors. Over 5,000 Chinese
enterprises have set up companies and branches in 139 countries
and regions. Some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
have been listed at stock exchanges abroad, raising a total sum of
9.56 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's import and export volume jumped from 20.6 billion
U.S. dollars in 1978 to last year's 325 billion U.S. dollars,
up from the 32nd place in the world to the 10th place in
terms of trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign currency reserve has increased from 170
million U.S. dollars in 1978 to 140 billion U.S. dollars in 1997,
ranking second in the world.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China approved the establishment of more
than 300,000 overseas-funded businesses with a total pledged
volume of 520 billion U.S. dollars. And more than 220 billion
U.S. dollars of overseas funds have been used.
</P>
<P>
China has been the second largest country in using overseas
funds for five consecutive years, next to the United States. At
present, 300 out of the 500 top multinational companies in the
world have made investment in China.

HAMAMATSU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia spikers defeated
volleyball powerhouse the Netherlands 15-9, 15-4, 15-13 at the
men's world volleyball championship in Hamamatsu on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the match, the Yugoslav jump serves posed great threat
to their Atlanta Olympicopponents. In the first set, after the
Dutch led 9-7, Yugoslavia scored eight consecutive points to
stage a comeback and grabbed the set.
</P>
<P>
They did not encounter strong resistance in the following two
sets before finishing the 93-minute match, handing the
Netherlands their first defeat since the beginning of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
It was Yugoslavia's fifth win in a row in the quarterfinal
Group H.
</P>
<P>
"My team had a very bad day today," said Dutch coach Toon
Gerbrands, "Yugoslavia didn't give us any easy points at all.
Besides, all our key players were having problems at the same
time. So we never had a chance to win."
</P>
<P>
China went down to Greece by 15-12, 11-15, 8-15, 12-15 to
remain winless in the same group.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Wang Jiawei said, "We learnt a great lesson
today: there were too many ups and downs. In the second set, we
performed like a different team. We can play better but when
something goes wrong, we don't seem to recover."
</P>
<P>
Greek head coach Stellios Kazazis said, "This morning I told
my team that they needed to be patient against a team like China.
We needed to concentrate on improving our reception and our
serving. In spite of a few injury problems, the players still
managed to win."
</P>
<P>
In other group H matches, Ukraine battled for five sets before
edging United States 15-12, 4-15, 15-12, 6-15, 15-8 while Italy
beat Russia 15-3, 15-8, 11-15, 15-9.

The use of overseas funds has accelerated the country's
economic development and promoted the economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The import of production technology for TV sets,
refrigerators, and washing machines enabled China to meet the
growing domestic demand in a decade.
</P>
<P>
China has also caught up with its world counterparts in car
production in just several years and the management in this sector
has reached the 1980s world level from the 1950s level.
</P>
<P>
The imported advanced technology, management expertise and
advanced means of production have also contributed to the
improvement of the overall quality of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The joint environment of international and domestic markets are
helpful to enhancing the market and competition awareness of the
Chinese enterprises, urging them to improve product quality and
management and cut production costs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the setting up of Sino-overseas equity
and contractual joint ventures has spurred the technical
transformation of 120,000 state and collectively-owned businesses,
helped train a large number of technicians and managers, and a
good number of enterprise groups have sprung up, which are
internationally competitive.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts, China's yearly export volume will reach
400 billion U.S. dollars in the year 2000 and increase to 800
billion U.S. dollars in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's average tariff level will drop further
to 15 percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
All these show that China will open up itself more fully to the
rest of the world in the next century.
</P>
<P>
China is not yet a strong trade country of the world with gross
foreign trade volume at present only accounting for three percent
of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Intensified efforts should be made to open up the country
wider, improve the way for foreign trade growth, readjust and
optimize the export commodity mix and the structure for
international market shares and the utilization of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Facing the opportunities and challenges at the turn of the
century, China has no other choice but to accelerate the steps of
opening-up. Only in this way can it accomplish the great task of
invigorating the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> HK IEF Approves First Loans to Major Event Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Steering Committee of
Hong Kong's International Events Fund (IEF) announced here on
Tuesday that three sports events are among the first six approved
for loans from the fund.
</P>
<P>
The sporting events include Samsung Action Asia Challenge
slated later this month, which is a new adventure sports event, a
Formula One powerboat world championship and an action-oriented
sports exposition, both due for next year.
</P>
<P>
Other events to benefit from IEF loans are a mega pop concert
by Canadian singer Celine Dion, an exhibition of priceless gems
from the Kremlin, which is one of the world's most famous
museums, and the return to the stage by Chan Po Chu, one of Hong
Kong's most popular film stars.
</P>
<P>
The IEF is a 100 million HK dollars (12.8 million U.S.
dollars), five-year fund provided to the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) earlier this year by the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to promote the
image of Hong Kong as the Events Capital of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Events considered for assistance by the fund include those in
such categories as sports, art and culture, entertainment,
exhibitions, conventions, food-related festivals and other
tourism related events.
</P>
<P>
The IEF is intended to assist event organizers to overcome
various specific problems, such as high up-front costs, that are
common in presenting international events in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Its main purpose is to provide short-term funding to the
organizers of commercially-sound, top-quality, international
events that might have difficulties in obtaining capital from
commercial sources. All the events approved by the IEF must
additionally have the potential to attract visitors to Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Fund is designed to support some 50 events over the fi
ve-year term of the loan.
</P>
<P>
The IEF Steering Committee comprises 14 members with
experience in events business.

<HEADLINE> Academy Announces Reform of Research Institute System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) today announced that it is making preparations for
a series of reform at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in
order to introduce a modern research institute system.
</P>
<P>
"It will be one of the 12 projects in the Knowledge Innovation
Program planned for 1998 and 1999," CAS Vice
President Yan Yixun said.
</P>
<P>
Yan said the reforms will be carried out in three stages. The
preliminary stage, from now through February 1999, calls for the
institute to employ 150 key research personnel and 600 "floating
employees". In addition, personnel working for hi-tech affiliates
will be separated from the institute.
</P>
<P>
The second stage, from March to the end of 1999, calls for the
institute to reduce its logistic staff, list hi-tech companies on
stock exchanges, and establish a comprehensive management system
for a modern research institute. All the restructuring and
improvements will be completed by the end of 2000, said
Yan.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics was established in
March 1949 and currently has a staff of 1,200 people. The
institute has successfully fulfilled many major state scientific
projects and in so doing has earned its name the "hotbed for
chemical physics".
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, we've found it quite difficult to meet the needs
of a socialist market economy and the knowledge-based economy with
the current management and operation systems," according to
Director Deng Maicun. He added that reforms will quite likely help
the institute produce new scientific achievements.
</P>
<P>
The CAS plays an essential role in the Knowledge Innovation
Program which calls for China to build 100 internationally
advanced state institutes and 20 comprehensive transregional
research centers by the year 2005.

Noting that the STI fell off its intra-day high, dealers said

<HEADLINE> Famine Worsens in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- There are different
outcries and bells of alarms are ringing as the humanitarian
situation in southern Somalia worsens with the number of famine
and flood victims increasing by the day.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu faction leader, Ali Mahdi-Mohamed, Tuesday
issued a statement characterizing the situation in central and
southern Somalia as "grievous".
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said hundreds of thousands of Somalis are now on the
brink of a total starvation after serious floods and drought hit
the regions of Bay, Eakol, Hiran, Galgudud, Lower and Middle
Jubba.
</P>
<P>
The statement said mass exodus of internally displaced
people has already begun in Middle and Lower Jubba regions after
Somalia's main river, Jubba, bursted its banks early in the
month.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said the ban of Somalia's meat by the Gulf countries
last year after the Rift Valley disease is also contributing to
the hunger in the central regions,
</P>
<P>
The famine in Say and Bakol
regions has especially been precipitated by the repetitive armed
clashes between the opposing militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and those of the Rahaiwein Resistance Army known as the RRA
fighting for control of those two regions, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also said there are also serious diseases such
as, cholera, measles, malaria, dysentery, scabies and
malnutrition, further aggravating the situation.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi made an emergency appeal to the international
communities especially the aid agencies and donor countries for
assistance to the starving people of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He said food, medicine, clothes and plastic sheets are
immediately required to help the flood-displaced people
in Middle and Lower Jubba regions.
</P>
<P>
These floods which still continue raging have so far seriously
devastated more than 30 villages and covered about 100 square km
of farmland wiping out all- food reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> France Regards Schroeder as More Realistic Than Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Tuesday that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is
more realistic than his predecessor Helmut Kohl in handling
relations with France.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Liberation, Vedrine said that
the new German government has shown "less sentimental feeling but
more practical spirit" towards France, its neighbor to the west.
</P>
<P>
The interview was published after French President Jacques
Chirac and Shroeder held an informal meeting in Bonn on Monday to
prepare their bi-annual summit scheduled for November 30.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine called an end to the "era of symbols" in the
Franco-German relations launched by Kohl and former President
Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Germany is "an ordinary great country" and "an ordinary great
partner" with its own national interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also played down the speculation that Germany wants to
replace the German-French locomotive in European construction with
a German-British-French triangle.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Foreign Trade Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade
enterprises will be issued digital ID cards on January 1, 1999,
and will be required to use the cards when dealing with Customs
offices.
</P>
<P>
Banks and foreign exchange (forex) bureaus will be able to
authenticate declaration forms by verifying related information
through a unified national network linking Customs offices,
according to information released today at a national conference
sponsored by the State Foreign Exchange Bureau and the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to eliminate fraud related to illegal
purchases of foreign currencies from banks, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
The lack of effective communications between Customs offices,
banks and forex bureaus has enabled some businesses to forge
Customs declaration forms or other documents needed to illegally
obtain foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Related acts have lead to a substantial outflow of foreign
exchange and have posed a threat to the security of the national
economy, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Trial operations of the new network in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangdong earlier this month proved successful.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Forex Bureau said the new network
will not only prevent Forex crimes, but also promote the
efficiency of Customs offices, banks and forex bureaus, and in
turn benefit both exporters and importers.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Condemns Assassination of Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami here on Tuesday condemned the assassination of an Iranian
opposition leader Dariush Foruhar and his wife by unknown
persons.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi Lari,
Khatami termed the killing as a "repugnant crime" and called for
prompt identification of the criminals, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter came after the National Security Council convened
Tuesday morning to discuss the assassination of the leader of
the Iran Nation Party and filed a report to President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Foruhar, 70, and his wife were stabbed to death at their
residence in northern Tehran. So far no person or organization
claimed responsibility for the killing.
</P>
<P>
"This repugnant crime, besides being highly regrettable, is a
source of concern about any doubts that might be created in
the people's minds regarding the ability of the system and the
government to guarantee the citizens' security and the prevalence
of law and stability," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president called for formation of a special
committee under the supervision of the interior minister and in
cooperation with the information minister, to identify the
perpetrators of the crime expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
Foruhar, a veteran Iranian political activist before the
Islamic revolution, founded the Pan-Iranist Party in 1951, but
left the party to lead Iran Nation Party as one of the
constituent groups of the National Front.
</P>
<P>
He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government immediately after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that toppled the former Shah regime.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Visits Novosibirsk in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOVOSIBIRSK, Russia, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Tuesday visited Akademgorodok, or Science City,
and the Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia's third largest city
of Novosibirsk.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here earlier Tuesday from Moscow, where he held
an informal summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and met
with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, State Duma Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov and Federation Council Chairman Yegor Stroyev.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting on Monday at the Moscow Central
Clinical Hospital, where Yeltsin was treated for pneumonia, the
two heads of state issued a joint statement on the China-Russia
Relations at the Turn of the Century.
</P>
<P>
They said in the statement that the two sides coordinated
their stands on the basic trend of the world social development at
the turn of the century, and reached consensus on the prospects of
further promotion of the long-term strategy for bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said that peace and all-round and
coordinated development should become an important principle to be
followed by the mankind in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed a joint statement on their border
issue, noting that under their border agreement signed in
September 1994 the fieldwork of demarcation in the western part of
their border has been finished.
</P>
<P>
At Akademgorodok Jiang delivered a speech in Russian.
</P>
<P>
Novosibirsk, a city of south-central Russia on the Ob River,
some 2,600 kilometers southeast of Moscow, is an important
transportation hub on the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
</P>
<P>
It prospered after the development of the Kuznetsk Basin.
</P>
<P>
As the capital of Novosibirsk Oblast, Novosibirsk is the
largest city and one of the chief industrial centers in Siberia.
Manufactures include mining equipment, turbines, textiles,
chemicals, and heavy machine tools.
</P>
<P>
It is the seat of a university and a scientific research center
and has opera and ballet companies.
</P>
<P>
The city, founded in 1893 as a stop on the Trans-Siberian
Railroad, received its current name in 1925. During World War II
(1939-45) many industries were moved to Novosibirsk from the
combat areas of European USSR.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is to conclude his four-day Russia visit Wednesday and then
fly to Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> UK Official Says No New NATO Entries Considered for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) - The United Kingdom Defense
Secretary George Robertson said Monday that no more countries
would be received into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) next April.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be issuing new invitations at the Washington
Summit," the Reuters News Agency quoted Robertson as saying while
commenting on the possibility of the upcoming expansion step of
the world's largest military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, which had been foes of
the West during Cold War, are to be made full members of NATO at a
Washington summit next April which will mark the 50th anniversary
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who is on his way to visit Czech, said the time had
come to reflect on any further NATO expansion at the moment.
</P>
<P>
But he said stopping issuing new invitations "doesn't mean to
say the door is closed,"
</P>
<P>
"The road beyond that is going to have clear milestones to
encourage other countries to become part of the European defense
family," he said.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and Romania are seen as being among the leading
hopefuls in the next wave of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe,
followed by Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
In the interview by the Reuters, Robertson made it clear that
membership of NATO was "not some sort of honor that is bestowed
upon new democracies".
</P>
<P>
"It is a functioning military alliance and it requires
interoperability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Lebanon's Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq Nouri here Tuesday reiterated Iran's "firm support"
for the national resistance of Lebanon against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Nouri made the remark in a meeting with visiting Secretary
General of Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, Hassan Nasrollah,
the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said the sacred and valiant jihad (holy war) of the
Islamic resistance movement against usurpers (Israelis) as
"honorable."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Palestinian issue, he said that the issue is
of strategic importance to Iran, and Tehran will stand by the
oppressed nation of Palestine to the end.
</P>
<P>
Nasrollah briefed Nouri on the latest developments in the
occupied territories in southern Lebanon, saying that the Islamic
resistance movement and the Lebanese people are resolute to
counter and resist the aggressions of the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in 1985
after two invasions, allegedly to protect its north region from
Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Israeli occupation forces and their allied
militia South Lebanon Army, have been engaged in a war of
attrition by the Lebanese resistance spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has
condemned the recent accord between Israel and the Palestinians,
in which Israel trades land for Palestinian security commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah chief, who arrived here on Monday, expressed hope
that Palestine will be cleared of usurpers through solidarity and
effort of all Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Economists Anticipate Improved Economic Development Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A report released today by the
Investment Research Institute under the State Development Planning
Commission indicates that China's 1999 economic development
environment and conditions will improve on 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
Economists with the institute noted that the positive effects of
state macroeconomic policies and reform measures introduced this
year will gradually gain effectiveness in 1999 and will thereby
create an advantageous policy environment for next year's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
They said that the fact that China's industrial and product
restructuring over the past few years has channeled resources,
capital, technology and personnel out of failing industries and
enterprises will promote a decline in low-level competition and
provide a better development environment for emerging industries
and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This year's massive investment in infrastructure will stimulate
growth in next year's demand and promote the development of other
industries. The gradual opening of the state's monopoly industries
and continuing improvement in the competitive environment for
enterprises with different types of ownership will provide
enterprises with more development possibilities and profit
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
China's financial system has rapidly developed in the direction
of fairness, openness and high-efficiency, and capital flow will
henceforth rely on credit and operational results of enterprises
themselves. Private enterprises, as well as small and
medium-sized ventures, will have greater access to various
fund-raising channels.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that next year's social investment will
surge some 20 percent, with consumption expected to grow by more
than 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, they point out lingering disadvantageous factors,
including the uncertainty surrounding the Asian economy, the
continuation of financial turmoil in the region and increased
credit risks. They stress that China should give full play to
favorable factors and continue to battle the negative effects of
unfavorable factors.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Urges U.N. to Prevent Aggression Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
must act to prevent the U.S. and British aggression against
Iraq and safeguard world peace and security, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Monday evening, Sahhaf said
Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors
had nothing to do with the U.S. and British military threats.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. must not intervene in this cooperation, this is
aggressive behavior. We do not respect the Americans and the
British because they are aggressors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on November 15 to resume full and unconditional
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming
Iraq, thus narrowly averted a U.S. military attack at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
On his country's dispute with UNSCOM over documents on Iraqi
disarmament, Sahhaf reiterated that Iraq had handed UNSCOM all the
documents concerning its weaponry.
</P>
<P>
"In fact we want to accelerate the process of arms inspections
so that the disarmament work will be finished in a short period
of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why any concerned party thinks that it is in the
benefit of the Iraqi government and Iraqi people to hide relevant
document, relevant to destroyed weapons. We have accepted to
destroy all the proscribed weapons or materials in the areas of
chemical, biological, nuclear program and missiles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When you destroyed the material itself, what is the benefit
of hiding documents?" he went on.
</P>
<P>
He described allegations by chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler that Iraq is holding back documents concerning
its chemical and biological program as "completely unfounded."
</P>
<P>
"Butler's allegations are politically motivated and have three
purposes: namely, to help the Americans create crisis, then
provide them with pretexts to launch military aggression against
Iraq; to hinder the comprehensive review of Iraq's disarmament
and to prolong the sanctions imposed on Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990 for its
invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions can not be lifted until the
UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said that "it seems there is no future for our relations
with UNSCOM if it remains a tool in the hands of the Americans."

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Regarding the promised
U.N. comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions, Sahhaf said even the Americans promised that it
would be conducted in a short period of time after Iraq resumed
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, as we expect, the comprehensive review is supposed
to be conducted quickly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister said UNSCOM alleged that Iraq was
conducting a "concealment mechanism" and UNSCOM set up a section
called "concealment unit" within its structure.
</P>
<P>
"All the people working in this section are spies of CIA
(Central Intelligence Agency) and others from the American
intelligence community," Sahhaf said, adding that the goal of
the section is to prepare the ground for procrastination.
</P>
<P>
"It is an excellent pretext to go on, to drag on, drag on,
without any result. So we have a phenomenon, it is a very
dangerous one: they are accusing us of not handing ovd and agreed upon
mutually between Iraq and UNSCOM and IAEA."
</P>
<P>
On the oil-for-food program between Iraq and the U.
worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its suffering people.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf accused the American and British representatives in
the U.N. Sanctions Committee on Iraq of putting on hold or
freezing under different pretexts contracts Iraq signed with
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the oil-for-food program was "of temporary
nature," adding that "our attitude is that it will be convenient
to have an extension of period of three months to the fourth
phase itself, so all contracts which have not been implemented
will have enough time to be implemented."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Currency Controls Facilitate Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The currency controls,
including pegging the ringgit at 3.8 to a U.S. dollar now in force
in Malaysia, have facilitated the country's foreign trade and
removed risks of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for
traders, Malaysian Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the imposition of the currency controls, the
country's trade balance recorded a hefty surplus of 38.7 billion
ringgit (10.184 billion U.S. dollars) for the first nine months of
the year compared with a deficit of 1.5 billion ringgit (394.736
million U.S. dollars) for the corresponding period last year, Wong
told Parliament, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Given this positive development in the trade balance, the
current account in the balance of payment is expected to record a
surplus of at least 20.1 billion ringgit (5.289 billion U.S.
dollars) this year," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the currency controls had also improved the
sentiments in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange with its Composite
Index and the Second Board Index increasing by 52.3 percent and
75.4 percent respectively since August.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the currency controls will not be lifted despite
notions that their immediate removal would increase flows of
foreign direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
He said the currency controls did not at all discourage foreign
investors from continuing to inject capital into the country.

... technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there have been some major new orientational
developments in the advancement of science and technology in the
world. The focus of research in the science of matters has been
shifted to the study of the properties of matters and their
interaction under extreme conditions, thus laying a new ground for
the creation of new materials, new energy and clean and
efficient technologies. Bio-engineering, which is centered on
molecular biology, promises a fresh major breakthrough, which will
open up a completely new prospect for agriculture, medicine and
human health. Information technology is finding its way into a
wide range of applied fields and evolving many new industries
through integration with other sciences, technologies, economy and
culture. Progress in the cognitive science, psychology and
behavior science has given new impetus to the scientific and
technological, educational, social and economic development. Space
science has helped people deepen their understanding of the origin
of the space and its evolution, providing a new panoramic picture
of the structure of matters and their interaction. Geo-science
has increasingly become a multi-discipline science, enabling man
to acquire new capabilities in the exploration, protection and
rational utilization of natural resources and ecological
environment. Scientific and technological development with its
overlapping, frontier and diversified nature and the ever-faster
production, dissemination and application of scientific and
technological knowledge have given rise to enormous socio-economic
progress, promising a bright future for human civilization.
</P>
<P>
The new scientific and technological revolution has presented
people of all countries with precious development opportunities
and also serious challenges. A country or nation would lag behind
and land itself in an extremely passive position unless it closely
keeps abreast with scientific and technological progress and
upgrades its scientific and technological level in the light of
its national development texture.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the challenge of rapid scientific and
technological progress and the fast rising knowledge economy, we
must keep on creating and innovating. Creativity is the soul of a
nation and an inexhaustible source of a country's prosperity. The
key to creation and innovation lies in human resources, whose
development depends on education. Only a well-developed education
can sustain scientific and technological progress and economic
development. Scientific and technological strength and the
educational level of a nation have always been an important
yardstick for measuring the overall national strength and the
civilization of a society. Like indispensable wheels, they propel
a country to prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Measures to Cut Business Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
Tuesday announced a long list of measures to reduce business costs
in response to the recommendations made by the Committee on
Singapore Competitiveness (CSC) earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made the announcement to
the Parliament Tuesday afternoon which had heated debates over the
CSC report in its latest two-day session starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total package of cost-cutting measures announced by Lee is
worth 10.5 billion Singapore dollars (1.63 to one U.S. dollar)
over one year, more than the CSC recommended, with three quarters
-- 7.5 billion Singapore dollars worth - comprising wage costs.
</P>
<P>
The cost saving package will be implemented through a 10
percentage CPF (Central Provident Fund) cut which will reduce
costs by about 3.9 billion Singapore dollars, five to eight
percent reduction in wages which is estimated to cut costs by
about 3.6 billion Singapore dollars, as well as a number of cuts
and rebates in government taxes and levies.
</P>
<P>
Most of the measures will take effect on January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the government did not ease the rate of Goods and
Service Tax which involves every one and forms a large amount of
the government avenue.
</P>
<P>
The government also leaves problems concerning the
much-talked-about personal tax, rentals for HDB (Housing
Development Board) dwellers to be tackled in next financial year.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hsien Loong said the packaged will help to make Singapore
companies, and the economy as a whole, more competitive, to reduce
retrenchments and unemployment, to attract new investments and
business, and to lay the basis for long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "We cannot be certain that as a result of
this package the economy will recover quickly."
</P>
<P>
Citing the Ministry of Trade and Industry has forecast a growth
of between minus one percent and positive one percent in 1999, Lee
said Singapore will have at least one more year of difficult
conditions.

China is one of the cradles of world civilization. Its
education and science both have a glorious history. The ancient
Chinese science and technology symbolized by the four famous
inventions--paper-making, gun powder, printing and compass had
once tremendously influenced the development process of human
civilization and profoundly changed the face of world
civilization.

Since the founding of New China, especially over the past 20
years of reform and opening-up, the Chinese Government has always
attached great importance to the development of science,
technology and education. The well-known conclusion that "science
and technology constitute a primary productive force" drawn by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping is now becoming an important idea guiding
China's development. We have given a prominent position to the
strategy of economic development through science-technology and
education and a sustainable development strategy when drawing up
the blueprint for the modernization drive. Recently we have
decided that the Chinese Academy of Sciences should take the lead
in introducing a pilot programme of instituting a national
knowledge innovation system. That is, to identify new objectives
of scientific and technological development, readjust the existing
operational mechanism, strive for more and greater scientific and
technological innovations and put in place an innovation system
for China in view of the need of a development strategy for China
of the next century and the prospects of the world frontier
sciences. In the 21st century, we will achieve a take-off in
science and education so that China's modernization drive will be
able to advance steadily along the path of development through
scientific and technological progress and through improved quality
of human resources.
</P>
<P>
China pays close attention to enhanced exchanges and
co-operation with the international scientific, technological and
educational communities, and has made an effort to learn from and
draw on the useful experience of other countries in developing
science, technology and education. It is gratifying to see the
smooth development of the scientific and technological exchanges
and co-operation between China and Russia. The Siberia Science
Center has established friendly ties and co-operation with many
Chinese research institutes. The new Siberia Nuclear Physics
Institute and Catalytic Institute have conducted fruitful
co-operation with their counterparts in China. With strong
scientific and technological capabilities, Russia has a huge
potential for development. The difficulties now encountered by
the Russian scientific and technological community are temporary
ones, which could very well be overcome by the Russian people with
endeavour. The scientific and technological strength is also
growing in China, where there is a big market for scientific and
technological products. All this promises a broad prospect for
scientific and technological co-operation between China and
Russia. In view of the above, I have specially included in my
delegation Academician Lu Yongxiang, President of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, and I would like to introduce him to you.
</P>
<P>
To advance scientific research and technological progress, it
is necessary to deepen our understanding of the objective world
and to scientifically utilize, transform and protect nature so as
to create better working and living conditions for mankind. I
sincerely hope that the scientific and technological departments
of our two countries will co-operate more closely and work for
greater results to the benefit of our two peoples and the people
of the world as a whole.

... world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia are influential countries in the world.
Now our bilateral friendly ties and co-operation have been
developing satisfactorily, which is in the fundamental interests
of the two peoples and is also conducive to world peace and
development. During the visit, President Yeltsin and I have
charted a course for the cross-century development of China-Russia
relations. We share the view that in the coming century China and
Russia should continue to observe the principles of non-alignment,
non-confrontation and non-directing against any third country.
The two countries should treat each other as equals, trust each
other, conduct mutually beneficial co-operation and work together
to meet all challenges that mankind faces in the struggle for
survival and development and promote world peace, stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The history of China-Russia relations tell us that our two big
countries, as close neighbors, are destined to live in amity with
each other, understand and respect each other, support each
other's stability and development, understand each other's
conditions and accommodate each other's concerns. China wishes to
be Russia's good neighbor, good partner and good friend forever
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in the interest of
common prosperity. This is the most fundamental and most
important connotation of the strategic partnership of co-operation
oriented towards the 21st century that our two countries are to
develop.
</P>
<P>
China firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and
has always stood for settlement of disputes between countries
through dialogue and friendly consultation. A developed and
progressive China will not pose threat to anyone. Even when China
becomes prosperous and powerful in the future, it will never seek
hegemony. This is the basic state policy we will continue to
follow unswervingly.
</P>
<P>
Friends,
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Russian peoples are great peoples. They are
both hardworking, talented and creative. Both countries have a
good tradition of giving priority to education and science. I am
sure that in the next century our two peoples will make greater
contribution to the development of world science and technology.
I sincerely wish all of you, scientists and friends present here,
fresh achievements in the lofty cause of science and technology!
I wish you good health and a happy life!
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Non-Performing Loan Rate Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The non-performing loan (NPL)
level of the entire banking system in the Philippines could climb
to 11 percent for September based on the central bank's
observation that the NPL level has been rising by an average of
0.5 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Reyes, officer in charge of the central bank, told
reporters here Tuesday that though there are still no official
figures from the central bank, the NPL level appears to be rising
by 0.5 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
He said that as of August, the NPL rate of the banking system
stood at 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the NPL rate could improve "if they
(banks) lend aggressively."
</P>
<P>
Other bankers estimated that the NPL rate of banks in the
country would continue to rise up to the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Florido Casuela, president of Land Bank of the Philippines,
predicted that the NPL rate in the Philippines would peak at 14 to
15 percent by the end of this year as banks declare more losses
due to the continued weak economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Central bank data show that the non-performing assets of
Philippine commercial banks have increased from 60.7 billion pesos
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in June 1997 to 201 billion pesos (5
billion dollars) in August this year.

<HEADLINE> Lao President Urges Effort to Overcome Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Lao President Khamtay Siphandone
has urged the Lao people to make more efforts to overcome the
country's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Lao official news agency KPL reported Tuesday that the
president made the call during his tour of the country last Friday
and Saturday. He visited the three northern provinces of Luang
Namtha, Bokeo and Sayaboury to guide the socioeconomic development
there.
</P>
<P>
Khamtay praised the achievements in local defense and
construction and development, which have promoted development in
the provinces, KPL said.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the eight priority programs laid
down by the government, particularly the foodstuff production
program to attain basic self-sufficiency based on the potential of
each province.
</P>
<P>
This program was aimed at transforming the mode of subsistence
production to market-oriented commodity production and to improve
the living standards of the people gradually, the leader said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998-1999, the president said, the country will still
experience economic and financial difficulties, especially
inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange, which will hinder
the socioeconomic development in Laos.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Khamtay said, it requires more efforts to involve the
whole country and all economic sectors to produce more food and
necessary commodities.
</P>
<P>
The president advised the local administrations to pay
attention to timely harvest and food storage and prepare for the
coming dry season.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Closer Sino-Russian Scientific Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOVOSIBIRSK, Russia, November 24 (Xinhua) -- There exists a
broad prospect for scientific and technological cooperation
between China and Russia, visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech to the scientific and technological
community in the Science City of Novosibirsk (New Siberia), Jiang
said, "I sincerely hope that the scientific and technological
departments of our two countries will co-operate more closely and
work for greater results to the benefit of our two peoples and the
people of the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the achievements made by the Science City of
Novosibirsk, the Chinese president said, "It is rare for a city of
only 1.7 million people to boast as many as about 100 research
institutes, 20 institutes of tertiary education and tens of
thousands of people specialized in scientific research."
</P>
<P>
"You in Russia have produced a wealth of achievements in
scientific research up to world standards as well as a number of
world-famous scientists such as Lavrentiev, Kantorovich and
Dubinin," he added.
</P>
<P>
With strong scientific and technological capabilities, Russia
has a huge potential for development, Jiang said. The difficulties
now encountered by the Russian scientific and technological
community are temporary ones, which could very well be overcome by
the Russian people with endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Russian scientists of the scientific development
in China, Jiang said that the scientific and technological
strength is also growing in China, where there is a big market for

<HEADLINE> Global HIV Infections Increased 10 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Global HIV infections in 1998
increased 10 percent and half of all new infections are among
young people aged 15-24, according to a report issued here Tuesday
by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
During the past year, a further 5.8 million people were
infected with HIV, approximately 11 men, women and children every
minute, and the total number of people living with the virus rose
by one-tenth, to 33.4 million worldwide, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The global epicenter of AIDS continues to be sub-Saharan
Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the epidemic began, 34 million Africans have been
infected, and almost 12 million of them have already died. In 1998
the region experienced four million new infections and rising AIDS
death tolls, seen in an estimated 5,5000 funerals per day.
</P>
<P>
In the regions of North America and Western Europe, the
availability of new more potent anti-HIV drug combination has
helped people with HIV live longer, healthier lives, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Every year for the past decade, the numbers of new HIV
infections have remained stagnant in North America and Western
Europe, with close to 75,000 people acquiring the virus in 1998
alone.
</P>
<P>
In many Asian and Eastern European countries, where the
epidemic started later than in other regions, HIV is rapidly
gaining new footholds. In India, for example, recent research
shows that HIV is now firmly embedded in the general population
and is spreading into rural areas that were previously thought to
be relatively spared.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, while infections are concentrated in men who
have sex with men and drug injectors, transmission through sex
between men and women is on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Restarts Talks With Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) has
called off talks with Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways on a
possible merger and restarted negotiations with U.S.-based
Northwest Airlines in a bid to get a better deal for PAL
employees, a PAL senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
that PAL Chairman Lucio Tan is now in the United States to hold
negotiations with officials of the Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that talks between PAL and Cathay collapsed
following a "major disagreement" over the latter's insistence on
firing 200 PAL pilots.
</P>
<P>
Cathay's demand runs counter to President Joseph Estrada's
commitment to protecting the security of the tenure of PAL
employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada assured PAL employees that they would retain
their jobs as long as he is president.
</P>
<P>
The president made the promise after he succeeded in convincing
them of accepting the management's offer of 20 percent ownership
in the airline plus three board seats in return for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said Tan also promised the 200 pilots that they would
keep their jobs because they stood by him during a three-month
labor dispute that led to PAL's closure on September 23.
</P>
<P>
The airline eventually resumed operations on October 7,
following a series of conciliation talks and the ratification of a
labor-management accord by PAL employees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada called on the PAL management Tuesday to
ensure the retention of its employees "at all costs" in its
negotiations with foreign investors willing to buy into the
cash-strapped airline.
</P>
<P>
"We have to retain the people, the laborers and pilots. They
must be retained at all costs," he told reporters in the
presidential palace.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Prosecute Marcoses on Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday it would pursue pending cases in court on the recovery of
the alleged ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses and was confident
that it would win the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
Philippine presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said these
ill-gotten wealth cases "will proceed and will continue to be
arduously prosecuted by the government in the absence of
compromise agreements with the parties involved."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to earlier reports that former
first lady Imelda Marcos is no longer interested in entering into
a compromise settlement with the government on the cases against
her family.
</P>
<P>
Another report quoted Imelda Marcos as saying she was confident
she would win her cases, adding that the assurance from the
government of the strict observance of the "rule of law and due
process" meant she would get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
With a fair trial, Mrs. Marcos said she would no longer seek an
amicable settlement with the government.

<HEADLINE> Full Military Honors Planned for Marcos' General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine Armed Forces
(AFP) chief of staff Gen. Fabian Ver will be buried in his
hometown in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte province, with full military
honors, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mercado told a press conference here that this was the
consensus arrived at a closed door deliberation by the board of
generals Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mercado described the decision of the board of generals as the
"best way to handle and put a closure to a chapter of our history
which has divided the people for so long."
</P>
<P>
Ver, who died in a Bangkok hospital last Sunday due to a
lingering illness, will be buried Sunday in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
His body will arrive in Manila Wednesday afternoon aboard a
Thai Airways flight from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The death of Ver, the country's second most powerful man during
the time of former president Ferdinand E. Marcos, has stirred a
controversy of whether he would be buried as a hero at the
Libingan ng mga Bayani in Manila, or given full military honors.
</P>
<P>
Full military honors for Ver does not pose any security threat
to the country, Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The decision should not in any way be a judgment or favor of
guilt or innocence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this so we can move forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The family of the late general has decided to bury him in
Sarrat to avoid further controversy.

TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek Foreign Minister
Abdulaziz Kamilov said here Tuesday that his country, like Iran,
is interested in the establishment of a broad-based government in
Afghanistan to bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov made the remarks upon his arrival in Tehran for a
one-day visit to discuss peace and stability in the region with
Iranian officials, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan and Iran, as two members of the 6+2 group (six
neighbors of Afghanistan plus Russia and the U.S.), hold common
views on issues pertaining to Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov noted that he will also hold talks with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on issues related to Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who was present at the airport to greet the Uzbek
foreign minister, said that Uzbekistan is a populous country in
the region, which has close ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it does not mean that the two countries hold
identical views on all issues, but the two sides can forge greater
understanding in the course of their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that in addition to issues
pertaining to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the region, he will
also discuss bilateral relations with Kamilov.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Uzbekistan, as two important countries in the region,
should develop closer ties, he said, adding that in bilateral
talks the two sides will exchange views on optimal utilization of
the existing potentials of the two countries.

MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Company (PLDT), a major player in the Philippines'
communication industry, Tuesday announced that the Hong Kong-based
First Pacific Ltd. has acquired a 17.2-percent stake in it,
representing 27.4 percent of the company's voting interest.
</P>
<P>
It was considered a major step in the company's ongoing
restructuring program as well as the buying-in bid, analysts here
said.
</P>
<P>
Manuel V. Pangilinan, newly-appointed president and chief
executive officer of PLDT, said the purchase of the PLDT stake was
largely covered by First Pacific's assets disposal program as well
as by bank credit lines.
</P>
<P>
First Pacific has agreed to pay 749 million U.S. dollars for
the PLDT stake.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of a significant stake in PLDT is a milestone
in First Pacific evolution from a diversified international
conglomerate into the owner of a select number of high-quality,
larger businesses within Asia," Pangilinan said.
</P>
<P>
Pangilinan also said that in the case of PLDT, First Pacific
will be adding significant value to one of the largest companies
in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians, World's Highest Sufferers of Anaemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has a total of about 27
million people suffering from sickle cell anaemia which is
believed to be the highest number of sufferers in the world,
according to a Daily Times report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chairman of Sickle Cell Foundation prof. Olu
Akinyanju as saying here that one out of every four Nigerians has
sickle cell trait and about 100,000 babies affected with the
disease are born every year in the country with a population of
about 120 million.
</P>
<P>
He noted that sickle cell anaemia is the commonest hereditary
disease in the world, adding that the number of the sufferers in
the country increases as the total population and carriers of the
trait rises.
</P>
<P>
Affected sufferers commonly referred to as sicklers suffer a
disproportionate frequency of illness and premature death
especially in infancy and childhood.
</P>
<P>
Akinyanju pointed out that there is no practicable cure for
the disease but expert holistic health-care management has shown
to significantly reduce the frequency of illness and of premature
death.
</P>
<P>
Akinyanju said his foundation would launch a 300 million Nairo
(3.5-million-Dollar) appeal fund for the setting up of a sickle
cell center in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The proposed center will create a data base for sickle cell
disorder in Nigeria, provide counseling to affected individuals
and serve as a reference lab for the diagnosis of sickle cell
disorders, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Arrive Alive Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Transport Department has launched a new round of Arrive Alive
Campaign to curb increasing traffic offenses in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the official launch of the campaign here Monday,
Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said the campaign running from
December 1 to the end of April next year would focus on combating
three main traffic offenses: speeding, driving while under the
influence of alcohol and lack of vehicle and driver fitness.
</P>
<P>
The department had spent more than 15 million Rand (2.7
million U.S. Dollars) on law enforcement equipment. Traffic
officers would, for the first time, use breathalysers which are
now allowed as evidence in court during the drunken driving
cases, Maharaj said.
</P>
<P>
Besides breathalysers, traffic officers would be armed with
hand-held tripod-mounted radar and laser pointing devices as well
as vehicles mo greater number of speed cameras, the
ministers said.
</P>
<P>
This year's campaign, the second of its kind since last year,
hopes to reduce road deaths by at least five percent from last
year's Christmas holiday figure of more than 1,000, officials
from the transport department said.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech in Science City of Novosibirsk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOVOSIBIRSK, Russia, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following is
the full text of the speech delivered on Tuesday by visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the Scientific and Technological
Community in the Science City of Novosibirsk (New Siberia).
</P>
<P>
- - - -
Respected President Dobrecov,
Distinguished Scientists,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I have long heard about the science city of Novosibirsk. But
seeing is believing. During the visit, I have been deeply
impressed by your scientific research capabilities and the
explorative atmosphere. I worked with a scientific and
technological department for years. In this sense, we are
colleagues. It always gives one great pleasure to meet
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a scientific and technological power in the
world. Russian scientists have made outstanding contribution to
the progress of human civilization. Lomonosov, Mendelev, Pavlov,
Ciolkovsky, Popov, among others, left their names in the world
history of science and technology. Even today, Russia leads the
world in many key scientific and technological areas.
</P>
<P>
The science city of Novosibirsk is a scientific base known for
its research strength. In both the basic sciences like
mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry, and applied sciences
like comprehensive utilization of energy, environmental protection
and nuclear technology, you in Russia have produced a wealth of
achievements in scientific research up to world standards as well
as a number of world-famous scientists such as Lavrentiev,
Kantorovich and Dubinin. It is rare for a city of only 1.7
million people to boast as many as about 100 research institutes
for different purposes, 20 institutes of tertiary education and
tens of thousands of people specialized in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The progress of human civilization has more and more
convincingly proved that science and technology constitute a
primary productive force and an important driving force for
economic development and social progress. None of the
achievements mankind has scored in understanding and taking
advantage of nature would have been possible without scientific
and technological advancement. Human wisdom is inexhaustible.
Science and technology are a shining beacon of this wisdom. A
great many scientists, one after another, have kept scaling new
heights in science and technology after overcoming numerous
obstacles through arduous efforts.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century is one full of unprecedentedly splendid
achievements in science and technology and full development of
scientific rationality. Never before has mankind produced as many
scientific results and material wealth as in this century. The
birth of the theory of relativity and the quantum theory early
this century, the breakthrough in the semi-conductor technology in
the 1950s and the discovery of the double spiral structure of DNA
have set off a round of geometrical development of science and
technology in the world. Since the middle of this century, major
progress has been made in the studies of atomic energy, space
technology, microelectronics, information technology,
bio-engineering and new materials, which has greatly increased the
human cognitive power of nature and society. Knowledge economy
has started to take shape, and new industries have kept emerging.
Mankind is experiencing a global scientific and technological
revolution.

<HEADLINE> Government, Rebel Forces Fight in South Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels continued their
fighting Tuesday in Maguindanao, the southern Philippines, to
consolidate their positions there.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency said government forces and
MILF rebels fortified their positions at the Datu Piang-Shariff
Agwak-Datu Piang complex in Maguindanao as the rebels continued to
hold a bridge along the Isulan-Cotabato highway in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Torrevillas, a spokesman of the government troops, was
quoted by the agency as saying they might be forced to use air
strikes and artillery shelling if the MILF rebels, numbering more
than 200, refuse to withdraw from the Labu-Labo bridge located
between the vicinity of Shariff Agwak and Talayan towns.
</P>
<P>
"Our Air Force might be striking hard at them right now," he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, the latest spate of skirmishes stemmed
from a series of exchanges of mortar shells between the two forces
at the complex for the past several days.
</P>
<P>
The two warring parties accused each other of having violated a
recently signed truce and of "provoking" renewed hostilities in
the area, it said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Imports Buffaloes from Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
importing African buffaloes back into the country in an effort to
breed disease-free buffaloes, daily newspaper the Star reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Six buffaloes arrived in Johannesburg Monday after an 11-hour
flight from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The buffaloes, ranging in age from nine months to two years,
were born in captivity and were free from disease like TB and
foot-and-mouth disease, said Pete Morke, veterinary for South
African National Parks (SANP).
</P>
<P>
The imported buffaloes would be kept in quarantine for a few
weeks. They were expected to be auctioned off to a game farm next
year, Morke said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been well-known for its large number of
buffaloes. However, large portions of buffalo herds in the
country are infected with diseases such as bovine tuberculosis
and foot-and-mouth and corridor disease.
</P>
<P>
The SANP was hoping to import more buffaloes form Singapore
Zoo in the next few years. In exchange for the buffaloes, the
SANP has agreed to donate five spotted hyenas to the Singapore
Zoo, Morkel said.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Get New Accounting System: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government will adopt accrual accounting standards used by the
business world for its next financial year budget, Australian
Finance Minister John Fahey said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fahey said the budget, to be introduced next May, would no
longer use the cash management method of accounting.
</P>
<P>
He said the new accrual-based framework would change both how
and what is measured for budgeting, accounting and reporting
purposes.
</P>
<P>
"The major reason is to improve the information base
underpinning all public sector activity and decisions," he said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"By adopting the accrual-based measurement tool, we can better
measure what is produced, what is achieved and what is consumed."
</P>
<P>
The current system ignores assets and liabilities and could not
account for income earned or expenses incurred during the
financial year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The result is that the financial health of an agency cannot be
assessed or compared one financial year to the next," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fahey said a comprehensive training program had been developed
to implement the changes.

PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said that the new government of Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder of Germany has less feeling but more practical spirit
than that of Helmut Kohl when dealing with the Franco-German
relations. He said that "the era of symbols" in the relations
between the two countries is over.
</P>
<P>
-- The government of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has
recruited thousands of ethnic Hutus from refugee camps at the
border between the DRC and the Congo Republic to fight the rebels
and Rwandan troops, who are mainly composed of Tutsis. This could
worsen the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in the DRC and
the rest of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French National Assembly on Tuesday will begin debates
on the adoption of the Amsterdam treaty, which will transfer a
number of powers concerning the national sovereignty, such as
immigration and political asylum, to the European Union. President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin have approved a
prior constitutional reform in order to adopt the treaty.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll by the French Committee of Education, 13
percent of French teenagers are suffering from obesity and 10
percent of them have thought of committing suicide. The poll, made
after 4,000 teenagers, also showed that family is the most
important place for teenagers, as their parents -- mainly mother
-- are their best advisors in life.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker on Falling Commodity Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Slumping commodity prices
drove the Australian dollar a quarter of a U.S. cent down Tuesday
before late buying lifted it off its lows.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 63.92 U.S. cents from 64.02
cents Monday, after trading between 63.63 and 63.94 U.S. cents on
the day.
</P>
<P>
Peter Whitley, foreign exchange manager of Australia's Colonial
State Bank, said the Australian dollar opened lower, forced down
by weaker commodity prices, but domestic buyers returned to the
market later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Whitley said the stronger U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen
and the German mark also impacted negatively on the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying 77.62
Japanese yen from 76.97 yen and 1.0918 German marks from 1.0828
marks at Monday's close.

MEXICO CITY -- At least 200 police agents in Mexico City were
arrested Monday on charges of serious crimes, including homicide
and corruption, in the first raid of its kind in the country's
modern history.
</P>
<P>
A public security official said that the arrest warrants were
based on an investigation into the November 6 police killing of a
youth in the Tlateloco district and the subsequent cover-up of the
killing. The arrests were preceded by several hours of stand-off
between the accused and a 300-strong judicial police force in the
northeastern part of the city. (Mexico-Police-Arrests)

SOFIA -- The Bulgarian government Monday made a decision
banning Yugoslav flights over the country's territorial space.
</P>
<P>
With this step, Bulgaria confirms its commitments as an
associated member of the European Union (EU) and joins the EU's
ban imposed on September 7 on Yugoslav flights, the Transport
Minister Wilhelm Kraus said Monday. The ban will be in force for a
duration of one year after the Foreign Ministry sending a note to
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia about the termination of the
bilateral air agreement, Kraus said. (Bulgaria-Yugoslavia-Flight

WASHINGTON -- The United States said on Monday it still wants
to encourage contact between Iranians and Americans, despite an
attack on a bus carrying 13 American tourists in Tehran last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, State Department spokesman James Rubin warned that
travelers to Iran should realize that attacks of this kind are
possible. In Iran, Islamic militants chanting "Death to America"
used clubs and metal bars on Saturday to smash the windows of a
bus carrying U.S. visitors. The tourists were accused of being
spies by some newspapers, but a former Iranian diplomat who
arranged the visit said the Americans wanted to explore
opportunities for trade. (US-Iran-Dialogue)

JAKARTA -- Indonesian former president Soeharto could be put
under house arrest or banned from traveling abroad if he
complicates the investigation of a commission as signed to probe
his wealth, national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If Soeharto complicates the investigation, saying he is hard
to be reached, then the commission will propose the need to impose
a house arrest or ban (from traveling abroad) on him," Attorney
General Andi M. Ghalib told reporters here on Monday. Soeharto was
forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's worst political
and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of corruption and
abuse of power during his 32 years in power. (Indonesia-Soeharto)

<HEADLINE> Philippines Opens Construction Sector to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it is bracing itself for the onset of foreign
entrants into its domestic construction sector in order to boost
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Electrical Construction Industry Forum here on
Tuesday, Raphael Lotilla, deputy director general of the National
Economic and Development Authority, said the construction sector
contracted by 3.8 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance shows that local contractors are not
undertaking any construction activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the government will welcome the entry of
foreign contractors in the country's construction sector to
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Though I understand the apprehensions of our local
contractors, I also see the opening up of private domestic
construction to foreign contractors as advantageous as it is
expected to benefit the construction industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign entrants into the construction sector have undue
advantages over local firms in terms of capital and technological
capability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Lotilla said, the resulting competition in the
construction sector will most likely cause the formation of
consortiums or mergers.
</P>
<P>
The trend would result in a more consolidated industry, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Gaza Airport Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The presidential plane of
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat landed
at the Gaza airport hours after it officially opened to traffic
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The airport's coming into operation brought the Palestinians a
step closer to realizing their long-cherished dream of an
independent statehood.
</P>
<P>
The airport, named Arafat International Airport, will greatly
facilitate and enhance direct air links between the Palestinian
territories and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, Arafat's presidential plane,
carrying the red-white-black Palestinian national flag, landed on
Palestinian soil. The crew stepped down amid warm welcome by
thousands of people at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane had been kept in Egypt, and in the past Arafat used
to drive to Egypt and then fly on from there.
</P>
<P>
But it will never be the same again. On Wednesday Arafat will
fly from this airport on his presidential plane to Paris to meet
with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The airport embraced its first guests early Tuesday morning. An
EgyptAir Airbus was the first to touch down, carrying a ranking
Egyptian delegation headed by Minister of Information Safwat
Al-Sharif. The delegates included Egyptian lawmakers, businessmen,
intellectuals and actors.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and senior PNA officials were present at the airport and
walked along a red carpet to welcome the Egyptian guests.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the airport was part of the implementation of
the Wye peace accord signed last month in Washington between
Israel and the Palestinians. It had been held up for two years by
Israel, which insisted on its role of security control over the
airport.
</P>
<P>
All together seven flights were scheduled to arrive Tuesday,
and a special plane will send European Union peace envoy to the
Mideast Miguel Moratinos here.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini
told Xinhua at the airport that for the Palestinians, the opening
of the airport was a big step towards the independence of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are happy about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that after years of hard
negotiations, this airport has finally been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
"The peace works," he pointed out, adding that "the opening of
the airport will also be helpful to the development of the
Palestinian economy."
</P>
<P>
A local Palestinian, Zeid Abu Elkerl, told Xinhua that Tuesday
is a wonderful day for the Palestinians, because many foreign
flights came to this airport. This was the show of support to the
Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the airport's main building, four Palestinian girls and six
male staff were busy answering phone calls and issuing
tickets. One of the girls, Sana Barbakh, said Tuesday was her
first official work day at the airport. "Today is the biggest
happy day for me in my whole life," she said.
</P>
<P>
The airport was built by Egyptian contractors with a total cost
of about 250 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Reports Breakthrough in Anticancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist said
here Monday that a non-toxic, low-molecule-weight compound has
been isolated from a fermented soybean product, which has
demonstrated promising anticancer effects in a series of
preliminary studies.
</P>
<P>
SBA, the compound so named as an identifying symbol, was
assigned by Professor Zhenhua Yang who discovered it.
</P>
<P>
At a presentation conference, Yang said that SBA has been
tested and evaluated in vitro (cellular level) studies at the
University of Southern California Pathology Reference Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The studies showed that SBA can induce apoptosis (cell suicide)
in a variety of tumor cell lines through suppressing the
expression of some oncogenes.
</P>
<P>
Animal studies on the antitumor effect of SBA were carried out
in the San Diego-based AntiCancer, Inc., using MetaMouse patented
animal models, which implanted human tumors directly into the
corresponding organs of mice. The tumor inhibitory rate of SBA in
human prostate cancer was 84.6 percent, and that in human liver
cancer was 64.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when Yang cultured K562 leukemia cell lines in her
laboratory in China, cancer cells in a flask were found to
completely disappear 48 hours after being contaminated by a kind of
bacteria. The bacteria were intentionally harvested and purified,
and later made into a soy-based fermentation product that can
inhibit tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
In the decade since then, the product has been used by
thousands of cancer patients in Asia as health supplement first
and anticancer supplementary drug later. In 1997, more than 10
years of continuous research by Yang finally led to the
identification of SBA as the key compound of anticancer activity
in the product.
</P>
<P>
Now SBA has been synthesized in the laboratory, and Yang has
filed U.S. patent.
</P>
<P>
Yang, now president of Pentagenic Pharmaceuticals, a Los
Angeles-based company of anti-cancer drugs, said her company plans
to initiate clinical trials of SBA in China early next year and is
currently seeking collaboration with partners and investors to
initiate FDA approval process.

<HEADLINE> Over 60 Dead, 200 Injured by Weekend Blizzard in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 23 (Xinhua)-- More than 60 were dead and 200
seriously injured in a blizzard hitting Romania last weekend,
the local authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
South and southeast parts of that country suffered heavy losses,
and Constantsa, Romania's only sea port, was closed due to the
blizzard at 80 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 train rides and several air flights were canceled
while over 1,000 vehicles left in the snow because hundreds of
kilometers of state highway were deep in snow.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 villages and some districts of Bucharest went
without power as high voltage power lines got damaged.
</P>
<P>
Though there is little possibility of heavier snow in the
future days, the bad weather may last. To avoid further losses,
the Romanian government has recommended residents to use public
transportation as much as possible.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Vietnam Plunges by 59 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in
Vietnam plunged by 59 percent in the past 10 months as the
financial crisis takes its toll, reducing capital inflow by an
estimated 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official weekly newspaper The Vietnam Investment Review in
its latest issue quoted a government report as saying that during
the first 10 months of this year, the government approved 124
projects worth 1.78 billion dollars and permitted some 77 licensed
projects to increase their investment capital by 522 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said that last year foreign investment reached 4.4
billion dollars with roughly 2.4 billion dollars disbursed.
</P>
<P>
"The regional financial crisis is taking its toll on Vietnam,
costing the country billions of dollars," said Nguyen Nhac, deputy
minister of planning and investment.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that for 1998, Vietnam would see only
about 1 billion dollars in foreign investment disbursed.
</P>
<P>
"I think a little more than 1 billion U.S. dollars will be
disbursed this year and 500 million U.S. dollars next year, unless
several build-operate-transfer projects are approved," the English
weekly quoted Asian Development Bank (ADB) chief representative
Jean-Pierre Verbiest as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ADB official said the dramatic drop in foreign investment
will hinder Vietnam's development, slow down its economic growth
and reduce its foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has already scaled down its economic growth target for
this year to around 6 percent from its initial 9 percent goal and
is aiming at a 5-6 percent growth next year.
</P>
<P>
International economists have also warned that the regional
financial crisis will have a greater impact on Vietnam in the next
few years, the weekly said.

<HEADLINE> Lahoud Sworn in as Lebanon's New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Emile Lahoud was sworn in
before the parliament Tuesday to become the country's 11th president
since the country's independence from France 55 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old former army commander took over power from
his 73-year-old predecessor Elias Hrawi, who served nine years in
the post in one-and-half terms.
</P>
<P>
A close ally of Syria, Lahoud was appointed army commander in
November, 1989, on the eve of the end of the country's 15-year-old
civil war. He has since devoted to rebuilding the army debilitated
in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The general was elected president on October 15 after winning
the approval of Syria and the majority 118 votes of the 128-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000 troops deployed as peacekeepers in Lebanon,
is the main power broker in the country. Lahoud's selection had
been decided in a summit between Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and his Lebanese counterpart Hrawi in Damascus on October 4.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said in his swearing-in speech that he would make
efforts in his six-year mandate to establish a free, democratic
and fair state ruled by laws and administered by institutions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity of pursuing a coordination policy
with Syria in the peace talks with Israel until all Israeli
troops pull out from its occupied south Lebanon, west Bekaa Valley
and Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war
and set up in 1985 a so-called security zone in south Lebanon with
the claimed aim of protecting its north.
</P>
<P>
Aparts from senior Lebanese officials and parliament members,
representatives from 19 countries and international organizations
attended the inauguration ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Steps Up Grains Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has stepped up
grains procurement in an effort to raise the income of farmers and
boost its buffer stock, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Nonato Joson, administrator of the National Food
Authority, said in a report that the food agency's corn purchases
represent about 120 percent of its targeted procurement volume for
this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency has assigned additional personnel to help in the
buying operations particularly in areas where grains procurement
is relatively heavy, Joson said.
</P>
<P>
In Mindanao alone, the agency in this harvest season would buy
some 32.2 million bags of corn valued at 1.4 billion pesos (35
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agency would be looking for additional funding to sustain
its buying operation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Construction Violators Punished in China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- While making great efforts
to accelerate highway construction, Henan Province in central
China has severely punished eight construction enterprises for
violating regulations.
</P>
<P>
To curb various illegal activities in highway contracts and
construction, the provincial communications department has
deprived the eight businesses of their qualifications to undertake
any construction projects in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Henan Highway Group Co. is one example. It did not meet the
required standards in constructing the highway between Zhengzhou
and Xuchang, as the road was found to have serious quality
problems in the roadbed and on the road surface.
</P>
<P>
The Nanyang Highway and Bridge Engineering Co. is another
example. It secretly offered a signed contract to sub-contractors
in a move to make illegal earnings, delaying the project for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
And serious accidents occurred along the highway between
Anyang and Xinxiang, which was undertaken by several construction
enterprises under the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Attacks on American Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Deputy Interior Minister
Mostafa Tajzadeh has condemned Saturday's attack against American
visitors in northern Tehran, local daily Iran News reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Attacking people, whether Iranian or foreign nationals, is not
acceptable to the Iranian government, Tajzadeh said in an
interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a group of Iranian mobbed in front of a hotel,
chanting "Death to America" and using iron bars to smash the
windows of a bus carrying 13 foreign visitors, mostly Americans.
</P>
<P>
They accused the Americans of being members of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
Hardline newspapers attacked the government for allowing the
"American spies" to visit Iran, but a former Iranian diplomat who
arranged the visit said the Americans came to explore
opportunities for trade.
</P>
<P>
Tajzadeh said that even if the Americans had been granted visas
by mistake, their lives should be protected by the Iranian
authorities. "Anyone who has entered the country legally is
entitled to Iran's protection," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is responsible for this and has contacted
concerned hardline organizations bordering on incitement to warn
that such a case must not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Despite the attack on American citizens, the United States said
on Monday it still wants to encourage contact between Iranians and
Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the government of Iran to adhere to the rule of
law and protect visitors to their country," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said, stating that Washington continues to
support President Mohammad Khatami's call for a dialogue between
civilizations and people-to-people exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise Sharply in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices soared in Tokyo
Tuesday with the key Nikkei index closing at its highest level in
nearly three months on foreign buying spurred by new record highs
posted on Wall Street overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 384.70 points, or 2.60
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 15,164.64, closing
above 15,000 for the first time since August 25. The Tokyo market
was closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, rose 24.87 points or 2.20 percent to
1,155.61.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was heavy at an estimated 580
million shares, up from Friday's 506.52 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of city gas and electricity firms, the
shares of all sectors got a boost from Wall Street, traders
said. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest
close ever, up 214.72 points to 9,374.27.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is exceeding everyone's expectations and Japan is
following suit," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
An additional reason for the euphoria was the yen's recent
realignment, or relative weakness, against the U.S. dollar since
this makes Japanese stocks better value for foreign investors, the
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outpaced losers 968 to 214, with 125 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Force Decline in Gold Demand in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The economic slowdown and
foreign sanctions imposed following India's nuclear tests last May
 resulted in an 8-percent drop in demand for gold during the third
quarter of 1998 in India, The Hindustan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While gold demand in the country during the quarter was placed
at 171.8 tons, imports in the period were put at 121.9 tons, the
daily said, quoting a report prepared by the World Gold Council
(WGC).
</P>
<P>
According to the WGC report, the difference between official
imports and overall demand was met by other imports and recycled
scrap gold.
</P>
<P>
India, one of the largest gold importer in the world, imported
132.6 tons of gold in the third quarter of 1997, WGC said in its
report released in Mumbai on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the country's currency, the rupee, since
the beginning of the year and a rise in import tariffs caused a
surge in prices of basic foodstuffs, which drained the consumer
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
As far as the world outlook is concerned, demand in the 25 key
markets monitored by the WGC totaled 1,712.2 tons in the first
three quarters of 1998, showing a decline of 20 percent compared
with the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Gaza Airport Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Gaza airport officially
opened to traffic Tuesday, bringing the Palestinians a step closer
to realizing their long-cherished dream of an independent
statehood.
</P>
<P>
The airport, named Arafat International Airport, will greatly
facilitate and enhance direct air links between the Palestinian
territories and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The first plane touching down early Tuesday morning at the
airport was an EgyptAir plane, carrying a high-ranking, 67-member
official Egyptian delegation headed by Minister of Information
Safwat Al-Sharif. Other members included Egyptian
parliamentarians, businessmen, intellectuals and actors.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and
senior PNA officials were present at the airport and walked along
a red carpet to welcome the Egyptian guests.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the airport was part of the implementation of
the Wye peace accord signed last month in Washington between
Israel and the Palestinians. It had been held up for two years by
Israel, which insisted on its role of security control over the
airport.
</P>
<P>
An official inauguration ceremony was scheduled later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Morocco airliner landed at the airport shortly after the
landing of the Egyptian plane. Five more flights will arrive
during the rest of the day, a Jordanian airliner and a special
plane of the European Union peace envoy to the Mideast Miguel
Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will fly from the airport on his presidential plane on
Wednesday to Paris to meet with French President Jacques
Chirac. He used to drive to Egypt and then fly on from there.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini
told Xinhua at the airport that for the Palestinians, the opening
of the airport was a big step towards the independence of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are happy about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that after years of hard
negotiations, this airport has finally been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
"The peace works," he pointed out, adding that "the opening of
the airport will also be helpful to the development of the
Palestinian economy."
</P>
<P>
A local Palestinian, Zeid Abu Elkerl, told Xinhua that Tuesday
is a wonderful day for the Palestinians, because many foreign
flights came to this airport. This was the show of support to the
Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the airport's main building, four Palestinian girls and six
male staff were busy answering phone calls and issuing
tickets. One of the girls, Sana Barbakh, said Tuesday was her
first official work day at the airport. "Today is the biggest
happy day for me in my whole life," she said.
</P>
<P>
The airport was built by Egyptian contractors with a total cost
of about 250 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Initiatives Against Smoking Not Effective: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 24 (Xinhua) -- International and local
initiatives against tobacco use are losing as smoking menace
continues to lurk for billions of people worldwide, experts said
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The experts made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the
week-long Fifth Asia Pacific International Conference on Tobacco
or Health held in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
On regional approach, Dr. S. T. Han, World Health Organization
Western Pacific Regional director, said the war against increasing
tobacco use is losing.
</P>
<P>
"Our weapons are too small and our strategies are too narrow,
what we have been doing is necessary, but not sufficient," he
said, adding that there is not enough focus on integrated,
inter-sector approaches to change lifestyle and behavior.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the tide of the battle requires more diverse weapons
and more encompassing strategies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alberto G. Romualdez Jr., secretary of health of the
Philippines, said in a speech that the country's five-year-old
Smoking Control Program, aimed at social mobilization and advocacy
for tobacco regulation, has not been very effective.
</P>
<P>
He said his department would change the strategy on tobacco
control and regulation.
</P>
<P>
That would be a "face-to-face campaign" which is expected to
change philosophy and lifestyle of many people deeply, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the conference said that about 1.1 billion of the
world's 6 billion population are smokers, about one-third of whom
are above 15 years old, and 800 million are in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, it is estimated that 73 percent of adults
and 43 percent of teenagers and children are smokers, experts
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Team Ends Fish Probe in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A three-man team from the
European Union (EU) has concluded their inspection tour of fish
factories and other equipment used by Uganda in exporting fish to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fish export to Europe hinges on the probe.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS),
who prefers to be unnamed, told Xinhua Tuesday morning that this
is the third EU inspection team to come to Uganda. The first two
came in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This team, who came here last week, visited various fish
factories and held talks with their respective owners. They also
inspected laboratory equipment and facilities at the UNBS and
laboratories at Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
The team will submit a report on their findings which will
determine whether or not Uganda should be allowed to resume
exporting fish to Europe under category one.
</P>
<P>
Under category one, Uganda would be allowed to export fish
products to any European country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was allowed to resume exporting fish to EU member
states under bilateral arrangements after its fish exports were
banned for about six months since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban, instituted by the EU in December 1997 due to the
cholera epidemic caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, was
lifted in July 1998 when nine Ugandan fish factories were allowed
to resume fish export to the European market.
</P>
<P>
Since the ban, the fish plants in Uganda have invested a lot
of money to upgrade their hygiene standards. Concrete landing
sites have also been erected on the Victoria Lake shores to
ensure that the fish deliveries are not contaminated.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Moves to Save Troubled Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- An expert chosen by the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and Finance Ministry Tuesday started
a titanic task to help save the cash-strapped National Bank of
Kenya (NBK) from collapse.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hamilton, a former general manager of the Kenya
Commercial Bank, is expected to help stabilize the country's
fourth largest bank's liquidity and stop panic withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
He will not have a seat on the board of the fourth largest
bank in the country, but his appointment will last until it is
ended by the Central Bank of Kenya and the NBK, the Central Bank
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a move that the bank should take full advantage of as
it is likely to restore investor and client confidence,"
financial analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NBK Chairman John Simba said Monday that the bank welcomed
Hamilton's expertise, adding that the bank was sound and that he
was confident of recovering long-term debts, which had accrued
for several years.
</P>
<P>
Over the last weekend, the Kenyan government injected two
billion Shillings (33.6 million U.S. Dollars) to save the bank
following panic withdrawals by depositors of 1.6 billion
Shillings from the bank in one week.
</P>
<P>
CBK chief banking officer Reuben Marambii said Monday that his
bank was positive that the NBK will regain from the run by
depositors and end the crisis which had put five commercial banks
under the CBK's statutory management in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Financial Minister Simeon Nyachae earlier linked NBK's
financial problems to non-performing debts or bad debts,
including 3.1 billion Shillings borrowed by government
corporations during 1990-93 and for which the government was the
guarantor.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's 1997 annual report and accounts, the
bank provided for 3.8 billion Shillings (60 Shillings equal to
one U.S. Dollar) for bad and doubtful debts, compared to 3.2
billion Shillings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government paid 1.5 billion Shillings
to the NBK to settle debts owed to the institution by five
private companies.
</P>
<P>
The NBK, with 23 billion Shillings in assets, has 29 branches
across this east African country.

<HEADLINE> India Opens Up Insurance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
decided on Monday to open up the insurance sector, allowing 26
percent foreign equity in the sector and additional 14 percent
investments by non-resident Indians, foreign institutional
investors and overseas corporate bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Indian cabinet, which met for over two hours Monday
evening, also decided to introduce legislation permitting
exclusive marketing rights to foreign companies in conformity with
its commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime on
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Work on another bill relating to the introduction of product
patents would be undertaken simultaneously, The Hindu daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha as saying the
cabinet had decided to introduce legislation in the coming winter
session of the parliament to allow private Indian companies into
the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the decision seems to end the monopoly of the
government-run Life Insurance Corporation and the General
Insurance Corporation on the business.
</P>
<P>
The opening up of the insurance sector is also aimed at
mobilizing large amounts of long-term finance to fund huge
infrastructure needs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet cleared amendments to the Indian Patents Act, 1970,
to provide exclusive marketing rights for applicants for product
patents in food, agro-chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said necessary amendments to the Life
Insurance Corporation and the General Insurance Corporation Acts
would also be undertaken simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the government has to amend the Patents Act,
1970, to meet obligations under the WTO rules which require India
to introduce a mailbox facility for new patent applications and to
allow exclusive marketing rights for five years to foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
India had earlier created the mailbox facility through an
executive order but the WTO had ruled that legislative backing was
needed for creating the mailbox.

<HEADLINE> Gaza Airport Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Gaza airport was officially
opened to traffic Tuesday, bringing the Palestinians a step closer
to realizing their long-cherished dream of statehood.
</P>
<P>
The airport, named Arafat International Airport, will greatly
facilitate and enhance air links between the Palestinian
territories and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The first plane touching down early Tuesday morning at the
airport was an EgyptAir plane, carrying a high-ranking, 67-member
official Egyptian delegation headed by Minister of Information
Safwat Al-Sharif. Other members included Egyptian
parliamentarians, businessmen, intellectuals and actors.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and
senior PNA officials were present at the airport and walked along
a red carpet to welcome the Egyptian guests.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the airport was part of the implementation of
the Wye peace accord signed last month in Washington between
Israel and the Palestinians. It had been held up for two years by
Israel, which insisted on its role of security control over the
airport.
</P>
<P>
An official inauguration ceremony was scheduled later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Morocco airliner landed at the airport shortly after the
landing of the Egyptian plane. Five more flights will arrive
during the rest of the day, a Jordanian airliner and a special
plane of the European Union peace envoy to the Mideast Miguel
Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini
told Xinhua at the airport that for the Palestinians, the
opening of the airport to traffic was a big step towards the
independence of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are happy about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will fly from the airport on his presidential plane on
Wednesday to Paris to meet with French President Jacques
Chirac. He used to drive to Egypt and then fly on from there.
</P>
<P>
The airport was built by Egyptian contractors with a total cost
of about 250 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Jiang's Upcoming Visit to Japan "Historic" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's scheduled state visit to Japan from November 25 to 30 as
guest of the Japanese government, the first visit to Japan by a
Chinese head of state, is a great event in Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
This year, the 26th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese relations and the 20th anniversary of the
Sino-Japanese treaty of peace and friendship, is an important and
historic period linking the past with the future, and Jiang's
visit is undoubtedly of both pragmatic and far-reaching
significance for the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Jiang will exchange in-depth views in a frank
manner with Japanese leaders, and have contact with people from
various walks of life in Japan, in a bid to build a framework for
bilateral good-neighborly friendship and cooperation oriented to
the 21st century, under a correct understanding of history
and with an eye to the future.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and Japanese sides have paid great attention to
this visit and made positive efforts to speed up preparations for
its success.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Japan normalized relations in 1972, bilateral
relations have had comprehensive and in-depth development, and the
two sides have conducted active exchanges and cooperation in
politics, economy, trade, science, and technology and culture with
fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
The development of bilateral relations, not easily come by and
worth treasuring, can be attributed to the efforts of the
older-generation of statesmen and those with insight in both
countries, and the efforts made by the leaders and the governments
of the past.
</P>
<P>
However, it should be pointed out that there are still some
problems existing between the two countries that cannot be
ignored, and the most sensitive and important problems are whether
Japan can have a correct position on the aggression launched by
Japanese militarists, and whether Japan can properly handle the
Taiwan issue, because these are important issues of principle
concerning the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations.

<HEADLINE> Township Businesses Do Well in Sichuan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in
southwest China's Sichuan Province generated 279.75 billion yuan
in output value during the first ten months of the year, a rise of
21.8 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
This increase is a result of local efforts to encourage the
establishment of shareholding and leasing systems, and experiments
with auctions and mergers among businesses.
</P>
<P>
The province has been supporting township businesses with the
use of loans and overseas investment, as well as technological
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Township businesses also have helped advance the
industrialization of local agriculture. Some 18,000 local township
firms are involved in farm-produce processing which brings in 23
billion yuan in output value a year.
</P>
<P>
The province had 53.24 billion yuan in fixed assets investment
during the first ten months this year, up 35.4 percent over
1997. The growth in spending helped create good conditions for the
development of local township businesses in construction, building
materials, machinery and labor services.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Jiang's Upcoming Visit to Japan "Historic" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People have noticed that Japanese leaders have repeatedly
stated they will have a correct understanding of the history and
admit the aggression, with deep retrospection.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan question, the Japanese side reiterated that it
will continue to abide by the principles enshrined in the
Sino-Japanese joint statement and bilateral treaty of peace and
friendship, and properly handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, people should be on the alert against the absurd
theories distorting history and denying the aggression, spread by
the Japanese right wingers who keep defying world opinion.
</P>
<P>
These words and acts have harmed the sentiments of the Chinese
people and have interfered with the smooth development of
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan, two neighbors separated only by a strip of
water, are both influential countries in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
The kind of Sino-Japanese relationship that will be brought
into the next century is a major subject facing the governments
and statesmen of both countries, because it not only concerns the
development of bilateral relations, but will also exert a direct
influence on peace, stability and development in Asia and the
world.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believes that as a new century approaches,
Jiang's upcoming visit to Japan is an important occasion to push
forward bilateral relations, and the two sides should seize this
historic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
People have every reason to believe that so long as the two
sides strictly abide by the principles mapped out in the
Sino-Japanese joint statement and the bilateral treaty of peace
and friendship, learn from the history, and properly handle
existing problems between the two countries, Sino-Japanese
relations are bound to have a sustained, steady and sound
development, and the two peoples will enjoy friendship from
generation to generation.

<HEADLINE> Initiatives Against Smoking Not Effective: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 24 (Xinhua) -- International and local
initiatives against tobacco use are losing as smoking menace
continues to lurk for billions of people worldwide, experts said
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The experts made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the
week-long Fifth Asia Pacific International Conference on Tobacco
or Health held in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
On regional approach, Dr. S. T. Han, World Health Organization
Western Pacific Regional director, said the war against increasing
tobacco use is losing.
</P>
<P>
"Our weapons are too small and our strategies are too narrow,
what we have been doing is necessary, but not sufficient," he
said, adding that there is not enough focus on integrated,
inter-sector approaches to change lifestyle and behavior.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the tide of the battle requires more diverse weapons
and more encompassing strategies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alberto G. Romualdez Jr., secretary of health of the
Philippines, said in a speech that the country's five-year-old
Smoking Control Program, aimed at social mobilization and advocacy
for tobacco regulation, has not been very effective.
</P>
<P>
He said his department would change the strategy on tobacco
control and regulation.
</P>
<P>
That would be a "face-to-face campaign" which is expected to
change philosophy and lifestyle of many people deeply, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the conference said that about 1.1 billion of the
world's 6 billion population are smokers, about one-third of whom
are above 15 years old, and 800 million are in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, it is estimated that 73 percent of adults
and 43 percent of teenagers and children are smokers, experts
said.

<HEADLINE> Half Million Tanzanians Confirmed HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- More than half a
million of Tanzanians have been confirmed HIV positive,
newspapers here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far, 520,000 HIV cases have been reported to hospitals
nationwide, but the country's population who have been infected
with the deadly virus are estimated at 1.5 million, said a
regional medical officer.
</P>
<P>
Ally Mzige, the medical officer for the Coast Region, also
revealed that 8.2 percent of blood donors in the country are HIV
positive.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Region in east Tanzania has become one of the most
highly infected areas in this east African country, following Dar
es Salaam, Mbeya and Kagera, he said, adding that 2,790 AIDS
patients had been recorded in the region by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This year's AIDS Day on December 1 will be marked in Kibaha,
some 40 kilometers northwest of Dar es Salaam, with emphasis on
educating the youth on the hazards of AIDS, he said.
</P>
<P>
The youth will be taught how to prevent themselves from
contracting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, he added.
</P>
<P>
The medical officer blamed the rapid increase of AIDS patients
on people's reluctance to change their sexual habits.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that some 30 million people are living
with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and 21 million of them are in areas
south of the Sahara Desert.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, a country with a population of 30 million, AIDS
is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and therefore has
the greatest impact on young people who are the most productive
age group, according to a government statement.

<HEADLINE> Grain Marketing Reform Effective in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Grain purchasing companies in
north China's Shanxi Province have gained profits of 24 million
yuan this year thanks to reforms in the grain-marketing system over
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The reforms were initiated early this year at a national
conference at which Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji called for
restructuring the grain-marketing system and developing a new one
responsive to the needs of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The new system will crack down on illegal private grain-dealers
who used to buy grain from farmers at a higher price in lean years
and refused to make purchases in bumper years. Consequently,
farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain was dampened and the state
grain purchasing companies across the country suffered losses of
200 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of Shanxi last July, Premier Zhu
urged local grain departments to implement central government
policies to the letter and tighten market management.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Shanxi has banned 516 illegal wholesale
grain markets and enforced a shake-up of grain stores in urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have set up 74 inspection teams to
cooperate with grain, industrial and commercial departments to
enhance the management of grain purchasing, processing, wholesaling and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the market price of one kilo of wheat rose by 0.12
yuan, and the price of corn is now higher than the purchasing
price.

SHENZHEN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Three key industry groups
including electronic information, biotechnology, and consumer
goods have now formed in Shenzhen, one of the country's five
Special Economic Zones in south China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
A city government official said that by the end of October,
output value of these three industries was 82.7 billion yuan,
nearly 70 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The electronic information industry in Shenzhen, an embodiment
of high-tech encompassing computers, telecommunications,
micro-electronics, and audio-visual products, had an output value
of 60.5 billion yuan in the January-October period, or 50.3
percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, China's largest base for the production, processing
and export of garments, clocks and watches, and toys, had 17.25
billion yuan of output value in consumer goods in the first ten
months this year, 14.3 percent of the city's total. Experts point
out that the consumer-goods industry here must still be upgraded
by high technology.
</P>
<P>
They also forecast that biotechnology in Shenzhen will
become still more promising in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> New Model Village in South China's Guangxi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- In northern Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, China has been constructing a new model village
which is completely different from the country's traditional
villages.
</P>
<P>
In the new village, also known as the Kenfu Demonstration Zone,
the village company, scientific research organization, production
bases and rural households are combined together, and government
officials, businesspeople, technical workers and environmental
protection experts act as village administrators in place of the
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The village administrators give farmers guidance in crop
planting and livestock rearing each year according to the market
situation and latest scientific and technological developments.
</P>
<P>
Meng Guanxi, manager of the village's Science and Environment
Company, said "My company provides farmers with technical training
and helps them to sell their products."
</P>
<P>
As the economic strength of the village improves, the company
will make money by signing supply and marketing agreements with
the farmers, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government of the Maonan Autonomous County of
Huanjiang, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Regional Commission of Science and Technology founded
the demonstration zone at a cost of over three million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In accordance direction from agronomists, the farmers have
grown grain on flat ground near the village, and planted
sugarcane, fruit trees and forests at the lower level, middle
level and top of the sloping fields, respectively, making better
use of the land and preventing soil erosion.

<P>
Tan Sanchuan, who is also chairman of the board of the the
village company, said "our purpose is to build a new village
featuring a rational use of resources and a healthy ecosystem so
that poor farmers can lead a prosperous life."
</P>
<P>
Small blackboards bearing instructions from technical workers
and information on the use of fertilizers and newly introduced
crops can be seen in front of many villagers' homes.
</P>
<P>
And now, tap water and electricity are available in the village
which is also connected to the outside world by highways. A
primary school has also been built near the village.
</P>
<P>
There are now 80 families and 400 people living in the
village. Most of them were previously poor people from ethnic
groups who moved over here from mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
"The place where I used to live is a typically cold mountainous
area and I would never be able to become prosperous there if
I stayed all my life," said Liu Shengyou, a farmer of the Shui
ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
"I wrote a report to the Huanjiang county government asking for
relocation after I learned from the press that Huanjiang was going
to build this development zone," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
According to a development plan, the demonstration zone will
grow fruit and sugarcane, and rear livestock and poultry as its
major occupations by the turn of this century, and every farmer in
the zone will have an annual income higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
The fact that there are few successful poverty-relief model
examples in developing countries is mainly because of poor
environmental protection and a lack of the comprehensive use of
resources, said Tan, adding that he hopes the Kenfu Demonstration
Zone will become an exemplary anti-poverty model for the
Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Experts caution that new model villages should differ according
to the actual conditions in various localities.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Privatization Unit Bails Out Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Privatization Unit (PU)
of Uganda has agreed to bail out the Uganda Airline Corporation
by paying a debt of 700 million Shillings (700,000 U.S. Dollars)
owed to Shell Uganda Limited.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's New Vision reported that PU accepted to be a
guarantor and is to pay 50 million Shillings (50,000 Dollars) per
month as way of settling the bill.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Airlines was dragged to court for failing to pay the
oil bills. The debt arose from the aviation fuel Shell supplied
the corporation and comprises both foreign and local currency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Justice James Ogoola entered judgement in
favor of Shell and ordered the corporation to pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the judge ordered that the repayment
be made in installments because repayment of the amount at once
was likely to cripple the operations of the airlines.
</P>
<P>
When the case came up in court, the judge ordered the PU to
deposit a check of 100 million Shillings (10,000 Dollars) as
security.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the cabinet meeting gave the PU a go-ahead to sell
off the 21-year-old corporation.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Not to Build New Ditches Along Yarmouk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Syria has promised Jordan not to
build new ditches along the Yarmouk River to ensure Jordan get its
full share of water, the semi-official Jordan Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Syria has already built more than 30 ditches along the
river`s tributaries in its territories to store water, Jordan
Valley Authority Secretary General Dureid Mahasneh told the paper
late Monday right after he signed a document with Syrian officials
about sharing the river`s water.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a previous bilateral agreement, Syria
can build no more than 25 ditches along the river, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to Syria's excessive construction of ditches, the annual
flow of the Yarmouk River has decreased from 470 million cubic
meters to 270 million cubic meters when it runs into Jordan,
Mahasneh said. Syria stands at the river`s upper reaches and
Jordan the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
In this case, Jordan can not get its full share of water from
the river, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1955, an Arab League committee on water set Jordan's
annual share of the river`s water at 330 million cubic meters and
90 million cubic meters for Syria. Syria currently gets 220
million cubic meters of water from the river each year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Syrian officials concluded a two-day meeting on
water issues Sunday and signed Monday the relevant documents to
co-construct a dam along the Yarmouk River and settle other
disputes about the sharing of the river`s water.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- El Mazuri, the chairman
of Tanzanian Seamen Union, has appealed to the government to curb
illegal fishing by foreign vessels within the country's
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
At least 70 foreign boats are operating illegally, taking away
fish and other marine products, Mazuri said, adding that the
government security measures against the activities have been
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to see large-scale foreign fishing vessels
operating some 82 kilometers off Pemba island without licenses,"
he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Tuesday, Mazuri has urged the
government to deploy more patrol boats and review the fee for the
licensing of fishing trawlers in the country, saying rates are
higher than those charged in Kenya and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the government for failure to address the
problem despite numerous requests by his association.
</P>
<P>
All foreign vessels fishing in Tanzanian waters must be
licensed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism and the
owners are requested to pay some 1,600 U.S. Dollars a month.

</P>
<P>
The record harvest is also the result of efforts taken to ensure the
irrigation of 54,660 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The sufficient supply and reasonable prices of farm materials

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Opposition Leader Sam Rainsy Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's main opposition
party leader Sam Rainsy and his party's parliamentarians returned
here Tuesday morning to participate in the Assembly's first
working session on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After arriving, Sam Rainsy and his supporters held a ceremony
at Wat Botum to commemorate those who died during the
demonstrations in March 1997 and September this year.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government rejected their previous demand to have
a public ceremony in front of the National Assembly and the
Cambodian Hotel to lay the wreath. Many military police blocked
the main intersections leading to the above places to prevent the
opposition from holding the rally.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's Assembly meeting, it is expected that the
members will be asked to elect officials in the Assembly and a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, whose self-named party looks to be the sole
opposition in the parliament, has tentatively supported the
FUNCINPEC-CPP coalition, but warned Monday that its performance
will be closely watched.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy said, "We are not interested in these power-sharing
games ... What we care about are the results. We will represent
the people in their desire for reform in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"Our participation in the Assembly is not an acceptance of the
election results," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Sam Rainsy returned to Cambodia since he
left September 25. Most of the party's 14 newly elected
parliamentarians are also outside the country.
</P>
<P>
He wrote to the king last week, expressing his hope that Hun
Sen must pledge that no Sam Rainsy Party members would be
arrested. He has rejected Hun Sen's previous assurance of
security, saying it is meaningless.

<HEADLINE> China Attracts Less Foreign Funds This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of newly approved
foreign businesses in China and their related contracted
investment were down by annual rates of 6.1 percent and 2.7
percent respectively during the first ten months of this year,
according to a report in today's China Business Times.
</P>
<P>
Without revealing the exact figures, Ma Xiuhong, assistant to
the minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said that
the slowdown has something to do with the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
She said that by the end of last year, over 80 percent of all
foreign investment was from Asian countries and that these
countries drastically reduced their investment in China this year.
</P>
<P>
However, because Europe and the United States raised their
investment profile in China substantially this year, overall
foreign investment will remain at a high level, though it is
unlikely to surpass last year's level of 45 billion U.S. dollars,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Ma added that China doesn't expect to do better in attracting
foreign investment next year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has for five successive years been the second
largest recipient of foreign investment after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Geologists: Granite Rocks Linked to Gold Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists claim they
have found close links between the movement of granite rock and
the forming of large and medium-sized gold mines.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jingyou, senior engineer at the Hunan Geological
Prospecting Bureau, announced this discovery jointly with
Zhong Dongqiu, senior engineer with a gold detachment of the armed
police forces, at a national symposium on mine prospecting.
</P>
<P>
The two senior engineers investigated the geology of more than
60 large and medium-sized gold mines in central China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
They found that most of the gold mines have direct or indirect
links to the movement of granite magma.
</P>
<P>
Further field work also proved that the continued movement of
granite magma brought gold to the earth's surface and formed the
mines, and that the mines become larger when there are sufficient
resources.
</P>
<P>
The geologists' new concept has also been demonstrated in gold
mines in other Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
For instance, a large gold mine in northwest China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region has close links with granite rocks
bearing potassium, and a gold mine in Hubei Province was found to
be enveloped with granite rocks.
</P>
<P>
The geologists believe that granite-rock areas should be
seriously considered in the search for gold mines in the future.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been
urged to pool resources and talk to each other to deal with the
AIDS epidemic as no country has adequate resources to
successfully tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made here Monday at the opening of a four-day
World Health Organization regional workshop on the reduction of
mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the Daily Herald reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Health
and Child Welfare David Parirenyatwa said: "Mother-to-child
transmission is a major challenge in Africa and we need to put
our heads together. This is a complex challenge as countries are
at different stages of development and have varied amounts to
tackle the problem."
</P>
<P>
The workshop has drawn 28 participants from Botswana, Kenya,
Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It aims
to bring together inter-disciplinary teams of public health
experts, research scientists, social scientists and
non-governmental organizations with a view to creating awareness
on the recent development on the reduction of mother-to-child
transmission.
</P>
<P>
It will also consider the implications of the interventions on
the health systems and the family and examine the role of
communities and governments in working together to reduce
transmission from infected mothers.
</P>
<P>
Parirenyatwa reaffirmed the Zimbabwean government's commitment
and support to the implementation of the strategies concerning
vertical transmission of the fight against HIV/AIDS in the
country, adding that he hoped other countries would do the same.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the workshop, participants are expected to have
an update on completed and on-going research and intervention for
reducing transmission from mothers to their children, synthesis
information on activities and experiences of various implications
for sustaining its reduction, and developing a draft regional
plan of action and give suggestions on approaches for networking
at national and regional level.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Union Calls off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has decided to call off the mass job stay-away
scheduled for Wednesday to give the government and the business
sector time to respond to its demands by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said in a statement
issued here Monday the ZCTU "has submitted its position paper to
the government and business, and has called for the convening of
the tripartite negotiating forum before Monday November 30,
1998."
</P>
<P>
He urged all workers to turn up for work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The labor movement's general council met in Harare last
Saturday to review the impact of its stay-aways since they were
introduced every Wednesday, some two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The national stay-aways have affected negatively on the
country's economy. In the strikes, the ZCTU demanded the
government announce a 20 percent wages and salaries increment and
reduce the price of fuel which has shot up by 68 percent
recently.
</P>
<P>
The government and business are both against a statutory wage
increment, preferring employers and employees to negotiate
through national employment councils.

<P>
YANTAI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has drafted a blueprint for the development of wind power as part
of an effort to promote use of the clean renewable energy resource.
</P>
<P>
The pilot wind power project was initiated on the island county
of Changdao earlier this year to provide abundant wind energy for
the well-known resort area.
</P>
<P>
The project will be completed at an estimated cost of 63
million yuan, including a German loan of eight million Deutsche
marks. The project includes the installation of nine 600-kw wind
mills imported from Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Changdao project, scheduled for completion in August 1999,
will supply 950.45 kwh of electricity annually. Total annual
income is expected to reach 14 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the Changdao wind power project will cost
an estimated 260 million yuan, including foreign loans of over 25
million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Dikes to be Reinforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 4.25 billion
yuan to reinforce river dikes and dredge the course along the
Yellow River, the second longest in China, from now till the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
These funds are part of the 100 billion yuan in long-term
treasury bonds issued this year for infrastructure construction,
urgently needed for economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis of the ambitious effort will be placed on the lower
reaches of the 5,464-kilometer-long river.
</P>
<P>
East China's Shandong Province has a 629-kilometer-long river
bank, 430 kilometers of which will be reinforced. The province
will also receive a government allocation of 1.56 billion yuan to
complete 81 projects. Work on 61 of these projects has already
begun.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, 70 percent of the planned projects
are expected to be completed, and all water conservation projects
should be completed before the next flood season (the end of
June), said Liao Yiwei, the provincial official in charge of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River begins in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and flows
across eight provinces before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The
river is considered the cradle of Chinese civilization and today
plays an important role in the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, the Yellow River is known for severe flooding in flood
season and dry spells at its lower reaches at other times of the
year. Experts have suggested that water control projects on the
middle reaches are needed to improve regulation of the river's
water flow and silting.

<HEADLINE> No NBA Labor Talks Until Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unidentified sources close to the negotiations revealed that
NBA owners and the union are targeting Saturday for the next full
bargaining session, although no specific date was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
ESPN Radio in Chicago reported a brief meeting among
Commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik,
union's executive director Billy Hunter and president Patrick
Ewing to plan further negotiating sessions took place today.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Stern lamented the difficulty in getting the sides
together, explaining that representative from both sides have to
be given several days notice in order to make the trip to New
York.
</P>
<P>
After canceling 194 November games, the league it will not
play a drastically abbreviated season. Were an agreement to be
reached, a 60-game season from January through April could be
played, with the postseason starting about 10 days late.
</P>
<P>
But time is running out. Even if the sides meet Saturday,
there would be less than a month until the Christmas doubleheader
on NBC,the start of the network TV season. With an agreement in
place, teams would need about a month to sign players and hold
training camps.
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, it appeared there would not be a season. But the
sides took small steps toward a meeting point on the percentage
of nearly $2 billion in basketball-related income that would go
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Last season, 57 percent of the BRI went to player' salaries -
well above the 52 percent that allowed owners to re-open the
agreement. The players were guaranteed to receive no less than 48
percent.
</P>
<P>
After imposing the lockout on July 1, owners wanted a hard
salary cap that abolished the Larry Bird Exception and gave them
50 percent of the BRI. They have modified their stance, coming up
to 52 percent for the players.
</P>
<P>
The players, who voted unanimously in Las Vegas two months ago
to never accept a deal that contained a hard cap, began with a
demand of 63 percent of the BRI but have come down, first to 60
percent and now to 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sides also are trying to implement an escrow system in
which players would put a percentage of their salaries in a fund,
which would go to owners if aggregate salaries rose above a
certain percentage.

<HEADLINE> Thai Export Markets Shrink as Asian Crisis Begins to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports during the
remainder of the year are likely to decline as major export
destinations began to feel the impact from Asia's economic
recession, Somchai Sahachairungreung, deputy government spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted Tuesday by the Bangkok Post as saying that
Thailand's major export markets, particularly the United States
and Europe, are showing signs of weakening.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report by the Thai Commerce Ministry,
Thai export to the United States during the first nine months
ending September grew by 9.9 percent to 9.064 billion U.S.
dollars, compared with 10.6 percent growth worth 7.959 billion
U.S. dollars in the first eight months ending August this year.
</P>
<P>
The decline is mirrored to varying degrees, in other major
export markets of the European Union, Africa and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Shipments to the EU between January and September grew at 7.7
percent to 7.171 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 9.8 percent
growth and 6.381 billion U.S. dollars from January to August this
year.
</P>
<P>
Export expansion to Africa also posted a slowdown from 24.1
percent (733 million U.S. dollars) in the first eight months to
17.3 percent worth 810 million U.S. dollars this year. Growth in
the Australian market was down from 7.1 percent to 6.9 percent
worth 835 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year exports in September fell to 4.676 billion U.S.
dollars, down 9 percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that exports during the first nine
months totaled 40.643 billion U.S. dollars, down 5.6 percent from
the same period last year. Imports were also down by 36.3 percent
to 31.869 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
Confronting the constant threat at the major world sports
gala, Deputy Prime Minister Bhchai Rattakul, also chairman of the
Games organizing committee (BAGOC), said, "We want people to come
to Bangkok for the 13th Asian Games knowing that they will be
safe,"
</P>
<P>
Bangkok will host thousands of athletes, officials, VIPs, and
spectators from 42 competing countries and regions during the
Asian Games slated for December 6-20.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a pipe bomb killed one and injured over 100 in the
Atlanta Olympic Park. Eleven Israeli athletes were murdered by
terrorists at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.
</P>
<P>
At present, Thai police have been cooperating closely with
Interpol to get intelligence about would-be terrorists and
demonstrators. The country has converged 16,000 officers to be in
charge of security during the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is very safe and we think nothing will happen,"
said Royal Thai Police General Kovid Bhakdibhumi, the deputy
chairman of security at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Among the forces, there is a hard core of special forces, bomb
detection units and riot squads trained by the United States to
deal with kidnappings and other terrorist action.
</P>
<P>
"The force is up to international standards and will be on
standby in all areas," said the police chief.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any Thai opposition parties and political
dissidents from other countries would be banned from taking
advantage of the Asian Games as a stage to protest at all Games
venues.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think demonstrations will happen but in case it
happens we can take care of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 30 Thai security officials have been sent to the United
States to learn security provisions.
</P>
<P>
To check weapons and explosives, the host demands that all
spectators to arrive at Thailand must be searched and made to
walk through airport style X-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles will be left in car parks away from stadiums and
park-and-ride services will operate to venues, in order to lower
the risks of car bombs.

<HEADLINE> Over 200 Mexican Police Agents Arrested on Crime Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 police agents
in Mexico City were arrested Monday on charges of serious crimes,
including homicide and corruption, in the first raid of its kind
in the country's modern history.
</P>
<P>
A public security official said that the arrest warrants were
based on an investigation into the November 6 police killing of a
youth in the Tlateloco district and the subsequent cover-up of the
killing.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were preceded by several hours of stand-off between
the accused and a 300-strong judicial police force in the
northeastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The raid, following last week's arrest of 16 high-ranking
police officers, was ordered by the city's new police chief
Alejandro Gertz and city attorney general Samuel del Villar as
part of the government's effort to eliminate corruption in police
departments.
</P>
<P>
Gertz urged the police to clean up their act, and attributed
the more than 20 percent increase in the crime rate in the past
week to criminal police gangs resisting his clean-up program.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Interior Ministry has been carrying out a campaign
to fight against crimes inside the police department. Members of
the federal police will be subjected to drug and psychological
tests as well as criminal background checks, and only those who
pass will be admitted to the force, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Revenue Income Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's revenue income fell
13 percent short of the target during the first four months of the
current fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The collection during the July-October period was estimated at
41.59 billion taka (about 866 million U.S. dollars) as against the
targeted 47.44 billion taka (about 988 million dollars), recording
a shortfall of 5.85 billion taka (about 120 million dollars) about
13 percent, The Financial Express daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first four months recorded a negative growth, as collection
in all sectors such as customs, value-added tax and income tax had
shown a poor performance, a Finance Ministry official was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The revenue income during the first four months was 1 percent
less than that of the corresponding period last year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The government projected a 14-percent growth in revenue income
for the first quarter of the year to raise funds to boost
development activities.
</P>
<P>
The revenue income in the budge for the 1998-99 fiscal year was
projected at 157 billion taka (about 3.27 billion dollars), 11
percent higher than the actual collection during the previous
financial year, and nearly half of the projected additional
revenue of 16 billion taka (about 333 million dollars) was
expected from higher collection of income tax.
</P>
<P>
"In real terms, revenue income in the first four months was all
time low," the official said, accusing the performance in revenue
collection of the National Bureau of Revenue of being "among the
worst in its history."
</P>
<P>
The devastating flood hitting the country from July to
September this year might have left some impact on the revenue
collection, but couldn't be blamed for the poor performance of the
bureau, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Rafael
Caldera and his visiting Brazilian counterpart Fernando Henrique
Cardoso on Monday inaugurated the first highway linking the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The 972-kilometer highway links the capital of the Brazilian
Amazonas state, Manaos, with the Venezuelan town of Santa Elena de

</P>
<P>
The highway was built with funds from Brazilian northern
Roraima and Amazonas states and a loan given by the Andean
Promotion Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Caldera and Cardoso said the highway would further boost
bilateral trade, which went up three fold between 1993 and 1997.
In that period, Venezuela has become Brazil's second largest crude
supplier.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also reaffirmed their commitment to the
creation of the Amazon cooperation treaty organization, whose
permanent secretariat will be based in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
Caldera and Cardoso also met privately on Monday and later
attended a meeting with cabinet members from the two governments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Dialogue With Iran Despite Bus Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday it still wants to encourage contact between Iranians and
Americans, despite an attack on a bus carrying 13 American
tourists in Tehran last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, State Department spokesman James Rubin warned that
travelers to Iran should realize that attacks of this kind are
possible.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, Islamic militants chanting "Death to America" used
clubs and metal bars on Saturday to smash the windows of a bus
carrying U.S. visitors.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were accused of being spies by some newspapers,
but a former Iranian diplomat who arranged the visit said the
Americans wanted to explore opportunities for trade.
</P>
<P>
Rubin described them as tourists and denied they were either
U.S. officials or agents of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the government of Iran to adhere to the rule of
law and protect visitors to their country. But of course, we also
continue to support President (Mohammad) Khatami's call for a
dialogue of civilizations and people-to-people exchanges such as
this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said a group calling itself Fedayeen-e Islam, which he
translated as Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam, claimed
responsibility for the bus attack.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman thanked the Swiss ambassador and embassy in
Tehran for helping the Americans leave the country quickly.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of diplomatic relations between Tehran and
Washington, Switzerland looks after U.S. interests in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Ban Yugoslav Flights Over Its Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government Monday
made a decision banning Yugoslav flights over the country's
territorial space.
</P>
<P>
With this step, Bulgaria confirms its commitments as an
associated member of the European Union (EU) and joins the EU's
ban imposed on September 7 on Yugoslav flights, the Transport
Minister Wilhelm Kraus said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ban will be in force for a duration of one year after the
Foreign Ministry sending a note to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia about the termination of the bilateral air agreement,
Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the ban, Bulgaria will lose over 1.2 million U.S.
dollars in airport charges and the Balkan Bulgarian Airlines will
suffer 1.9 million dollars' loss in the one-year period.
</P>
<P>
However, after the expiry of the 12-month ban, the air services
between the two countries are expected to resume because the Sofia
Airport is an important point of departure for Yugoslavs,
especially for those heading for the U.S., Kraus stated.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a flight ban on Yugoslavia on September 7 over
the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pharmaceutical Company Develops New Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. pharmaceutical
company said Monday that it is developing a drug that will
significantly increase the effectiveness of platinum in treating
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based Access Pharmaceuticals said that the
second-phase development of its patented compound polymer
platinate was underway.
</P>
<P>
Polymer platinate was developed by Ruth Duncan, an
internationally recognized scientist in polymer therapeutics at
the University of London School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The compound consists of platinum linked to a polymer, which
results in greater delivery of the platinum drug to the tumor site
while inhibiting release in the general circulation, thus reducing
side effects.
</P>
<P>
According to Access, in preclinical animal studies comparing
this compound to cisplatin, the design feature of polymer
platinate allowed for a 15-fold increase in platinum dosage,
delivering over 60 times more platinum to the tumor site, with
significant inhibition of tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
Platinum compounds are one of the leading classes of
chemotherapeutic compounds in the world with an estimated annual
sales of 800 million U.S. dollars, said Access.
</P>
<P>
But because of their side effects, doctors often cannot deliver
the dosage necessary to achieve maximum therapeutic advantage. In
cancers such as ovarian, the ability to increase the dose of
platinum can have a significant impact on the clinical
effectiveness of the drug, according to professor of medicine at
the University of California-San Diego Stephen Howell, quoted by
Access.
</P>
<P>
Howell said that polymer platinate can overcome the side effect
problem in platinum therapy.
</P>
<P>
Access develops bioresponsive drug carriers to target and
control the release of therapeutic agents into sites of disease
activity.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Scientists See Sunspot Activity Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
sunspot storms, usually only seen south of New Zealand, have been
seen from Wairarapa in southern part of New Zealand's North
Island, raising concerns about ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday quoted scientists at the
National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research as saying
that it is unusual that the aurora, associated with solar
activity, is being seen so far north at this stage of the solar
cycle, indicating the sunspot activity will increase.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the increase in sunspot storms is sending much
more ultraviolet radiation into space and people should wear
sunblock this summer, the Dominion reported.
</P>
<P>
Astronomer Richard Hall said that sunburn time will become much
 shorter. Incidents of melanoma rise and fall with the solar spot
cycle, about every 11 years on average.
</P>
<P>
He said a maximum period of solar spot activity is building up
and will peak between 2001 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
This is backed up by the fact that auroras, caused by particles
from the sunspot storms bombarding Earth, are already visible in
parts of New Zealand, the astronomer added.
</P>
<P>
Hall said that the sun will not necessarily be any hotter as
the solar activity increases, but the radiation coming through is
going to be much harsher.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 24 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government has
been taking a series of measures to develop agriculture, aiming at
increasing productivity and agricultural incomes while reducing
costs to consumers, agricultural officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measures being taken include providing agricultural seed,
planting material, credit, basic infrastructure, storage,
marketing facilities and agricultural lands, and to this effect
priority has been accorded to promote seed paddy production in a
number of districts, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture is to provide a grant of 1.5
million U.S. dollars to encourage production and supply of quality
seed and increase average yield, said Salinda Dissanayake, deputy
minister of agriculture and lands, when addressing a meeting of
farmer families recently, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Dissanayake also said a program to encourage farmers to
diversify low country paddy lands to other crops has been
implemented and in order to encourage agricultural marketing,
import of refrigerated trucks has been permitted duty free.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister pointed out in the 1999 budget with a view
to expanding the agricultural production base, the government has
identified about 100,000 acres of cultivable lands. The government
will take steps to establish farming villages, providing basic
infrastructure such as roads, electricity and water, the sources

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Urges Peaceful Approach to Row Over Kurdish Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema on Monday urged Turkey to moderate its protest campaign
against Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for dialogue. But I see that the other side is
engaged in a violent anti-Italian campaign. This kind of behavior
should be avoided. I am seeking a peaceful solution," he said at
his weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
Turkey on Sunday threatened Italy with an arms and trade
boycott unless Ocalan is handed over. Ankara has branded him a
"separatist terrorist" for leading the Kurdistan Workers' Party in
its 14-year armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Italian protests were held in several parts of Turkey on
Sunday, including a parade of 130,000 demonstrators in the central
city of Kayeri and a sit-in of 1,000 people outside the Italian
embassy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
A number of Turkish companies have canceled contracts with
their Italian partners while Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin
said Sunday that Turkey would file a complaint against Italy with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Trying to play down the government's role in the decision to
refuse to extradite Ocalan, detained over a week ago at Rome
airport on an international warrant from Germany, D'Alema stressed
that "it isn't up to the government to decide whether the
decisions are right or not because the jurisdiction is
independent".
</P>
<P>
"As a friend of Turkey, I say that the Turkish people should be
sending out signals of an entirely different nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Rome Court of Appeals turned down the Turkish
demand to hand over Ocalan and ruled he remain in private
accommodation in Rome and report to the police daily.
</P>
<P>
Italy's constitution forbids extradition to a country that
practices the death penalty, which is in force in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara blames Ocalan for the more than 30,000 deaths in the
civil conflict and wants to try him for treason.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels' Demand for Troop Withdrawal Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Defense
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda on Monday rejected the rebels' demand
that government troops be withdrawn from a neutral zone set aside
for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Lloreda said at a news conference that only 100 disarmed
soldiers remained in the zone, compared with 2,000 armed members
of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), the country's
biggest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have demanded the withdrawal of the last soldiers
from San Vicente del Caguen, one of five municipalities
demilitarized since November 7 to prepare for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This decision comes from the president (Andres Pastrana) and
it seems reasonable that the host can decide who stays in his
house," Lloreda said.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the soldiers "is not a threat or a challenge,
but a simple administrative support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lloreda also noted that Colombian courts had made a "very
respectable decision" when they announced that magistrates would
not attend a meeting proposed by the rebels this week to exchange
soldiers for FARC prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the magistrates refused to attend a meeting between
FARC leaders and government representatives, claiming that the
courts were judicial bodies, not political agencies.
</P>
<P>
Lloreda said he hoped that Colombia's public opinion would
"pressure the guerrilla so that they see Colombia wants peace."
</P>
<P>
Some 27,000 people were reportedly killed in civil conflicts
and drug trafficking violence in this South American country last
year.

<P>
NINGBO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo port in east China's
Zhejiang Province has witnessed a rapid growth of container
shipping since the beginning of the year.

During the January-October period, the port handled 293,000 TEU
(ton equivalent unit) containers in the January-October period,
up 38.3 percent over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The port plans to develop main routes for international
container shipping by the end of the year, and has already opened
routes to Wenzhou, Taizhou and Guangzhou, as well as to a number
of countries in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> More Forests Saved After Summer Floods in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of axes have been
collected and locked into storehouses over the past two months
under the Chinese government's urgent logging ban following this
past summer's catastrophic floods.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many forests have been saved to help prevent
serious soil erosion problems, believed to have been largely
responsible for exacerbating the flooding.
</P>
<P>
Flood-stricken provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Heilongjiang and
Jiangxi all formulated forest conservation and afforestation
plans immediately after the floods receded.
</P>
<P>
Forestry departments at all levels became the busiest
government organizations during the past two months.
</P>
<P>
"We are now starting a nationwide forest conservation project
which will cost nearly 20 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars) over the next three years," said Li Yucai, deputy
director of the State Administration of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, this project -- China's largest natural
conservation project in history -- will turn one million
lumberjacks into tree-planters in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last June, catastrophic floods raged along the
Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers. The floods claimed 3,000
lives and cost more than 300 billion yuan (some 37.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Because the Yangtze River and the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers
respectively rise in China's two major forest zones, experts
believe that forest conservation and afforestation efforts are
essential for flood control.
</P>
<P>
"History shows us that to protect forests is to protect our
homes, and the loss of forests is equal to the loss of our lands
and lives," said Jiang Zehui, president of the Chinese Academy of
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, one expert warned that if the current
logging situation continues, the 80 million hectares of forests
now remaining in China will completely disappear in about ten
years.
</P>
<P>
However, after this summer's floods, those concerned about the
fate of the forests are finally being heeded.

<HEADLINE> Italian Shoe Companies to Use Chinese Brand Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Italian shoe
manufacturers have started production of 30,000 pairs of shoes a
year under the Chinese brand "Senda," the name of a rural
enterprise in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time a rural enterprise has lent its name to
foreign manufacturers," said Lu Xueyi of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, adding that this marks a new stage in the
development of rural enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that the common practice of Chinese rural
enterprises in the past was to borrow the brand name of famous
manufacturers to sell their products.
</P>
<P>
The Senda Group, now 20 years old, has an annual output
capacity of two million pairs of shoes and a 39 percent share in
the Chinese market. The company also sells its products to other
countries including Italy, Japan and France.
</P>
<P>
Italian manufacturers, Alexander Nicolette, Bgtoli and Fakkc,

<HEADLINE> Economist: China's Economic Growth Must Be Observed Fairly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Today's China Daily carried a
by-lined article from a Chinese economist who said that eight
percent economic growth should not be hailed as a rigid commitment
or it might foster cheating grassroots statistics or herald
another round of investment boom.
</P>
<P>
China set its target of economic growth for 1998 at eight
percent earlier this year. However, the protracted Asian economic
crisis and serious domestic flood have created difficulties for
the protection.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoguang, an adviser of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said China's industrial output grew by 7.8 percent from
January to August, bringing about 6.9 percent of gross domestic
product growth. To accomplish the final target, growth of eight
and 10 percent must be realized in the third and fourth quarters
of the year.
</P>
<P>
It might not be a mission impossible, but surely it has many
difficulties, he said, adding the true growth rate, 7.5 to 8
percent, is already an outstanding performance in the gloomy world
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, inappropriate structure, low efficiency and
environmental issues are major problems which confront China's
economy. Some real term-term indices such as power generation
output, energy consumption and cargo volume have contradicted
apparent economic growth on paper. Discrepancies have also been
found in provincial data.
</P>
<P>
Restarting China's economy should keep in view long-term
development planning, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that the rise in China's economic growth
rate has never lasted more than three years after climbing out of
a slump. The average span is 2.1 year. Overheated growth is the
main reason behind this, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a word, economic acceleration should keep in mind healthy
economic development in the future to avoid blindly repetitive
investment which might kindle explosive inflation.

<HEADLINE> Economic Slowdown Affects Auto Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The demand for automobiles has
declined along with the slowdown in economic growth in China,
according to the Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
Between January and September, the growth in the demand for
automobiles plummeted from seven percent to 0.51 percent as the
growth of gross domestic product slowed down by 1.8 percentage
points in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The drop is largely attributable to the sharp fall in the
demand for cars and minibuses, which constitutes the bulk of
market demand.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, car sales rose by 3.65
percent, compared with 27.2 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The sales of minibuses grew by 14.27 percent, also 15.63
percentage lower than the 29.9 percent rise last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sales of light-duty vehicles and medium-sized
trucks, which has remained sluggish, continued to see negative
growth.
</P>
<P>
According to market analysts, decreased institutional demand is
the prime reason for the slower auto market. For example, sales of
the Red Flag and Santana cars, mainly targeted for institutional
users, dropped respectively by 22.31 percent and 0.63 percent in
the first eight months this year.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Predicts Growing Trade With EU in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The pending bilateral
trade accord between Mexico and the European Union (EU) is showing
strong possibilities for mutual economic gains next year, Mexico's
state-owned Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext) forecast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Mexico and the EU will reach 28 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of 1999, doubling the volume so far this
year, according to bank sources.
</P>
<P>
Bancomext advocates a strong presence in the new EU economic
arena, saying that trade diversification on export-import markets
can contribute to Mexico's future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the EU started negotiations on November 9 to
establish free trade in goods and services between them.
</P>
<P>
The first round of negotiations was held in Mexico City, with
two more slated for Brussels.
</P>
<P>
During the current year, Mexico has exported four billion
dollars worth of goods to EU members and imported 10 billion
dollars of goods from them.
</P>
<P>
Of Mexico's total foreign trade so far this year, the EU
countries accounted for just 6.4 percent while the United States
and Canada -- its two partners under the North American Free Trade
Agreement -- accounted for 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Substantial drops were registered in Mexico-EU trade in the
past few years. In 1982, Mexico's exports to EU countries
represented 21 percent of its total foreign trade; the percentage
slumped to nine percent in 1990 and only 3 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto May Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto could be put under house arrest or banned from traveling
abroad if he complicates the investigation of a commission as
signed to probe his wealth, national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If Soeharto complicates the investigation, saying he is hard
to be reached, then the commission will propose the need to impose
a house arrest or ban (from traveling abroad) on him," Attorney
General Andi M. Ghalib told reporters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country 's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib said: "If the commission can conduct their task with
ease, there is no need for an arrest. So, it depends on the
intensity of the independent commission's work."
</P>
<P>
Ghalib has been assigned to lead an official probe team from
the Attorney General's office investigating Soeharto's wealth.
Many circles have criticized the team for failing to uncover
Soeharto's treasures.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General said the government had been paid due
attention to public aspirations, as reflected in its readiness to
set up an independent commission to investigate Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not think the planned independent commission's
work would interfere in the probe his office was conducting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tommy Soeharto, youngest son of former president,
has been barred from going abroad for a year in connection with
his alleged involvement in a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Tommy spent three hours at the Attorney
General's office on Monday answering questions about a
52.5-billion rupiah (7 million U.S. dollars) land scam in North
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The investigation came amidst a growing chorus for the
government to investigate allegations of corruption, collusion and
nepotism against Soeharto, his family and cronies.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Requalifies For WB Soft Loan Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed in
principle to once again make International Development Assistance
(IDA) interest-free soft loans available to Indonesia because the
economic crisis has dragged the nation back down into the ranks of
low-income countries.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reporters here on Monday that at an
exchange rate of 8,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar, Indonesia's per
capita gross domestic product now stands at around 400 U.S.
dollars, down from a pre-crisis level of over 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We are once again eligible (for IDA loans). We now have the
right to ask for this type of assistance," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It will be of benefit to us if we can have loans with softer
terms than previous ones. The World Bank has agreed to this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar declined to provide further details, saying that the
National Development Planning Board was still studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
Loans issued under the World Bank's IDA scheme have a 40-year
repayment period, including 10 years of grace period, and do not
charge interest but only administrative fee. They are made
available to countries with a per capita income below 900 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar explained that Indonesia first received IDA loans in
1968, but lost its entitlement to this type of assistance when it
jumped from the ranks of low-income countries to the group of
middle-income nations, as classified by the bank.

BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Economic
Commission has reported a total retail sales volume of 10.23
billion yuan for the city in October, a rise of 10.6 percent on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Food sales in Beijing rose nine percent to 3.88 billion yuan in
October. Fanned by news of an imminent rise in the cost of color
TV sets, 44,373 color TV sets were sold in October, nearly double
the number one year ago, with certain models completely sold out.
</P>
<P>
A warm October resulted in a 13.2 percent drop in clothing
sales, which stood at 1.32 billion yuan. The growth rate was 22.1
percentage points down from that a year earlier. Only sales of
woolen and cashmere sweaters saw slight and stable rises.
</P>
<P>
The price index in October dropped by 0.5 percentage points on
a yearly basis to 97.3 percent. The index is expected to grow in
the last two months of the year, but only by a small margin, the

<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourist arrivals in
Thailand rose 6.4 percent to more than 5.6 million in the first
nine months of this year, according to figures released by the
Tourism Authority of Thailand available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors was 5.2 million during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Authority said the increase was due to a "rebound in
arrivals from major sources such as China and Japan."
</P>
<P>
The third quarter alone saw increase in Chinese and Japanese
visitors by 66 percent and six percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Europe, with a 23.3-percent increase, continues to be among the
fastest growing tourism markets for Thailand, while the number of

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in Dealing with Millennium Bug Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese computer scientists
in Beijing and Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan
Province, have developed a new way to deal with the so-called
millennium bug -- or year 2000 problem (Y2K) -- which can be
widely applied in personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is a computer software problem stemming from
the software's two-digit time and date memory. Many predict that
great confusion is likely to occur in the next century if the
software's date-tracking element is not revised.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan Subotaike Digital System Engineering Corporation and
the Beijing Hongdun Information Technology Corporation have
jointly developed a card which offers a solution to the Y2K
problem by reconfiguring a computer's BIOS setup.
</P>
<P>
The card, called the "Computer Year 2000 Pass Card," has an
eight-digit time memory which can be widely applied in many
personal computers.

Shearer, who missed Monday's match at Everton because of a
hamstring injury, would fetch up to 20 million pounds (about 34

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Metropolitan Shanghai has
recently developed a new tourism program, bringing domestic
tourists to many of its modern industrial compounds.
</P>
<P>
A local tourism official said that local travel agencies have
designed a dozen tours to such places as the Baoshan Iron and
Steel Plant, Shanghai Volkswagen, Shanghai Petrochemical Company,
and Jiangnan Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, more than 5,000 officials, students and soliders
have joined tours to Baoshan Iron and Steel where they visited
workshops, watched production process, and admired the beautiful
gardens around the plant.
</P>
<P>
The grass, trees and flowers planted around the factory changed
the stereotyped thinking that iron and steel plants are dirty and
polluted, some tourists said.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest industrial city, Shanghai has scores of old
and modern enterprise giants to attract tourists, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the 130-year-old Jiangnan Shipyard has set up an
exhibition hall displaying one-million documents and 3,000 photos
about the plant, which has recorded the history of China's
industrial development.

<TEXT>
<P>
Everton defeated Newcastle 1-0 to end a run of six league
games without a victory.
</P>
<P>
The penalty was awarded in the 18th minute after Carl Serrant
hauled down Don Huchison on the edge of the box near the byline.
</P>
<P>
Ball drove the spot kick fiercely into the roof of the net,
giving Everton fans the chance to cheer only the second Everton
goal in seven premier league starts at Goodison Park this season.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle, without a win in their previous four league games,
enjoyed a high percentage of the possession in the second half,
but rarely threatened an equalizer.
</P>
<P>
The win lifted Everton one place to 16th in the table.

<P>
LANZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous
County at the foot of the Qilian Mountain in northwest China has
become the world's leading breeding center for the white yak.
</P>
<P>
This county, in Gansu Province, now boasts 89,500 white yaks,
believed to be the largest herd in the world.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the precious species, the county built a
comprehensive breeding center and a data bank for fine breeding
genes in recent year, greatly contributing to the rapid
multiplying of the herd.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest yak breeder, an animal especially
loved by the Tibetan people who treat it as a "divine ox."
</P>
<P>
The white yak bred in Tianzhu features highly nutritious and
pure meat, fine milk and precious wool. The tail of the white yak
is a special item, with the purchasing price reaching 120 yuan
(14.45 U.S. dollars) per 0.5 kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The county, the first Tibetan autonomous county in New China,

<P>
JAKARTA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
House of Representatives have agreed that next year's general
election will be held on June 7, the Indonesian Observer reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The date was decided on at a meeting between Home Affairs
Minister Syarwan Hamid and leaders of the House, United
Development Party (PPP) Chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum was quoted
by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Metareum said the government and legislators will not stall the
election, because they are serious about accommodating the
aspirations of the public.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Ministry spokesman Herman Ibrahim told reporters
that the June 7 date is in line with a decree recently issued by
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR decree stipulates the general election must be held in
May or no later than June.
</P>
<P>
After attending a limited cabinet meeting on politics and
security affairs last Thursday, Hamid said the election would be
held no sooner than mid-June.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hamid met with House leaders to decide on a definite
date, following public concern the government and House wanted to
delay the election in an attempt to foil opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Many opposition leaders still want the election brought
forward, but Metareum said June would be the month that counts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us want to delay the general election,"
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Solicitor General Andy
Scott resigned Monday over allegations that he prejudged an
inquiry into police conduct at last year's informal leaders
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Scott said he resigned as a result of his
remarks made on an airline flight on October 1.
</P>
<P>
During the APEC meeting, student demonstrators, who were
protesting the presence of then Indonesian President Soeharto,
were sprayed with pepper gas by Royal Canadian Mounted Police
officers.
</P>
<P>
After the police opened an investigation into the incident this
year, an opposition New Democratic Party member of parliament
claimed to have overheard Scott say to a friend that Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Staff-Sergeant Hugh Stewart would be the
fall guy for the incident.
</P>
<P>
"That conversation made me vulnerable to accusations that I had
prejudged the outcome of the public complaints commission
inquiry," Scott said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, all four opposition parties at the
parliament had called for Scott's resignation after the
conversation was made public.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien accepted on Monday
Scott's resignation "with great regret".
</P>
<P>
"I understand that you feel that continued controversy impairs
your ability to continue the important and effective work you have
undertaken as solicitor general," said Chretien's letter of
accepting the resignation.
</P>
<P>
Scott was replaced by Labor Minister Lawrence MacAulay, whose
post was taken by another parliament deputy from New Brunswick,
Claudette Bradshaw.

SHENYANG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Software Group
Co. Ltd. of Northeast University (NEU) based in Shenyang, capital
of Liaoning Province, has benefited from the more than 22 million
U.S. dollars of foreign investment it has attracted since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The group's various indicators, including economic returns,
have all shown rapid increases over the eight years.
</P>
<P>
The company, formed on the basis of the NEU Software Center in
1996, is a large enterprise group specializing in applied basic
research, and most of its scientific achievements have met
domestic or international advanced standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the NEU Software Center and the Alpine Corporation of
Japan established NEU-Alpine Software Institute (Co. Ltd.) at a
cost of 250,000 U.S. dollars. So far, the joint venture has raised
9.61 million U.S. dollars of funds from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The group has also established business ties with a number of
other foreign companies, including Toshiba of Japan, Medison of
the Republic of Korea and the Baan company of the Netherlands, and
formed a strategic cooperation partnership with IBM, which has
enabled the group to maintain its capacity for developing software
at an advanced level.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with a number of countries, it has developed
more than 100 programs and attracted about five million
U.S. dollars of foreign funds.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday
that further reduction in U.S. and Russian nuclear arms would save
defense funds in both countries.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Cohen said the military, under orders
from Congress, was exploring a variety of options on nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"As I have indicated before, it is costly to the United States
to maintain those (START-1) levels" and "it is more costly to
Russia to maintain those levels," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"That is the reason why we have tried, on each and every
occasion, to persuade our Russian counterparts it is in their
interest, as well as the United States, to ratify START-2 as
quickly as possible so we can reduce the levels and then move on
to START-3," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was in response to a New York Times report Monday that
the Pentagon had quietly recommended in a report last April that
Congress consider unilateral cuts because of weakening security
threats and budget concerns. (US-Nuclear-Cuts)

<HEADLINE> Panama Agency Says US Used Biological Agents in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A Panama-based agency has
accused the United States of using biological agents to cause a
porcine fever epidemic in Cuba in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian Studies and Social Action Center said in a
report released Monday that under President Richard Nixon, U.S.
intelligence agents in a military base had given anti-Castro
Cubans a sealed container containing a porcine plague virus.
Later, the Cuban government was forced to kill about 500,000 pigs.
</P>
<P>
The 1971 epidemic was described by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization as "the most alarming" illness that had
affected Cuba that year.
</P>
<P>
The agency, which based its report on a study made by U.S.
researcher John Lindsay, said the U.S. had also tested chemical
weapons in Panama.
</P>
<P>
"Documents proving that Agent Orange was tested or used in
Panama have not been found, but there is a possibility that the
defoliant was also tested in Panama," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Protects China's Only Pasture in Urban Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
has demanded that all the buildings be torn down and all the
grassland, cultivated without permission, be returned to the
government in order to protect the Lhalu Pasture, the only urban
pasture in China.
</P>
<P>
Part of the 600-hectare pasture, located in the urban area of
Lhasa, capital of Tibet, is divided, occupied, or cultivated by
some companies and individuals for their own interests. And more
than 73.3 hectares had been damaged by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The local government organized a team made up of officials from
the departments of urban construction and environmental protection
to investigate the situation.
</P>
<P>
The government then set up a natural reserve there, listing it
among the Ninth Five-Year (1996-2000) Plan projects, and
stipulating that no companies or individuals are allowed to do
any damage to the pasture again.
</P>
<P>
Part of the misused grassland has already been returned to its
original condition.

Fellow-Briton Richard Burns regained first place in his

McRae had led the closing world championship event of the

when Burns shot head as the field moved into the traditional
Welsh forest stages.

"The car is knackered and that's that," said McRae. "It is a
disappointing end to a bad year for me. I really wanted to do
well here and everything was going really well until this happened
."

<P>
McRae was forced out by a piston failure while driving on the
public road between special stage 19 at Cefn and stage 20 at
Sweet Lamb.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the former world champion had complained of
spectators standing in dangerous positions along the roadside.
</P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over Iraq's
documents should be solved through dialogue and consultation,
China said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Shen Guofang, Chinese Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, said China was very
concerned about the latest development of events on Iraq's documents.
</P>
<P>
Shen said there were differences between Iraq and the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction on the issue of documents.
</P>
<P>
 Shen said Iraq should implement the obligations under
relevant U.N. resolutions and at the same time, UNSCOM also
should strictly conduct its mandate in accordance with the
resolutions of the Security Council and seek guidance from the
Council on major decisions.
</P>
<P>
 Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, wrote to Iraq
early last week, asking it to hand over more weapons documents.
But Iraq has reiterated that It does not have any more
documents to hand over.
</P>
<P>
The dispute about the documents erupted late last week, a
few days after the United Nations arms inspectors returned to
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Investigators Hear Willey Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of
Representatives impeachment investigators on Monday took testimony
from a lawyer for Kathleen Willey behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Willey alleged in March President Bill Clinton made an unwanted
sexual advance to her in the White House.
</P>
<P>
House Judiciary Committee lawyers conducted a more than
three-hour deposition with attorney Daniel Gecker, who refused to
comment to reporters as he left, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Willey, a former White House volunteer, alleged she went to see
Clinton about a full-time job in November 1993 when he groped her
in a room near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
Monday's deposition was the first of four scheduled closed-door
sessions beyond last week's public testimony by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr sent evidence to the committee earlier this month related
to the Willey matter.
</P>
<P>
But Starr did not contend the material amounted to potential
impeachable offenses. Committee Democrats have criticized the
subpoenas for Gecker and the others as evidence the panel's
Republicans are fishing for a stronger case.
</P>
<P>
Gecker was wanted to see whether the president or any of his
advisers attempted to influence Willey's testimony.
</P>
<P>
The committee also has called Nathan Landow, a Maryland
developer and Democratic fund-raiser who is suspected of trying to
convince Willey to change her story. Landow invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination when called before
Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
The committee also has called Clinton's attorney Robert
Bennett, who represented him in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit, and White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey. They are to
testify later next week.
</P>
<P>
Committee Republicans have indicated they are still pressing
ahead with a planned article of impeachment against Clinton, even
though a growing number of moderate Republicans have made it clear
there is probably not enough support to approve impeachment in the
full House.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Figure Acquitted in Embezzlement Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater figure Susan
McDougal was acquitted on Monday of embezzling from conductor
Zubin Mehta and his wife, a case she said was trumped up to
pressure her to testify against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The jury in the trial in California, acquitted her on all
counts, including forgery and failure to pay state income taxes,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
McDougal, 44, was accused of stealing from Mehta and his wife,
Nancy, when she worked as bookkeeper and personal assistant to
Mrs. Mehta from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The case took five years to get to trial. McDougal had
steadfastly refused to testify against her friend Clinton before
the Whitewater federal grand jury -- a decision that cost her 18
months in jail for contempt.
</P>
<P>
In addition, McDougal served more than three months of a
two-year sentence in a Whitewater-related loan fraud case. She was
released because of a painful back condition.
</P>
<P>
Also convicted were her late ex-husband James McDougal and
former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker. She still faces
prosecution in Arkansas for her refusal to testify in the
Whitewater case.
</P>
<P>
In the California case, Defense lawyer Mark Geragos said
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had promised to make the
embezzlement charges go away if McDougal would testify. When she
refused, he alleged, Starr "propped up" the case and urged
prosecutors to move on the defendant, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jurors had said they knew of McDougal's standoff with Starr but
agreed to ignore it.

agriculture".
</P>
<P>
Ten out of 15 European Union farm ministers on Monday voted to
lift the export ban on British beef more than two years after it
was imposed over mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Blair added that personally he was "absolutely delighted" to
see the end of the 32-month ban which has cost the country
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Blair's remarks were echoed by Agriculture Minister Nick Brown,
who said it was "a very good day for us, but it is actually a
better day for the European Commission. It has played fair by
Britain."
</P>
<P>
Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar also said it was the beginning
of a new future for Scottish farmers.
</P>
<P>
Dewar said the industry in Scotland had worked hard to raise
standards and ensure that the highest-quality meat would be
available for the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
He said: "This decision is excellent news for the whole of
Scotland's beef industry and comes as a direct result of this
government's determination to put this item at the top of the EU
agenda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Works to Resolve Ocalan Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
said it was working with Turkey, Italy and Germany to defuse
tensions among them over Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a daily briefing, State Department spokesman James
Rubin acknowledged Ocalan probably would not be extradited by
Italy to Turkey, as Washington initially had urged.
</P>
<P>
But he said the United States and its allies are reviewing a
"full range of options", which he did not define, to ensure Ocalan
will be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said "emotions are riding high" on all sides of the case
and the United States is "determined to do what we can to
encourage a climate in which he (Ocalan) is brought to justice."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has discussed the
issue with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini but the subject
was not expected to be raised when she met in Washington on Monday
with German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Turkey decided to pull the plug on two
Italian state-run cable television channels, underlining its
increasing anger at Rome's refusal to extradite Ocalan, head of
the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Italian law bars extradition to a country where the death
penalty remains in force, as in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
While praising Rome for "accepting international
responsibility" to arrest him, Rubin also stressed that "the PKK
is a terrorist organization and Ocalan must be held accountable
for his role in the PKK's terrorist activities."
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism of any sort is unacceptable and the international
community must be committed to seeing that justice is done," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Nuclear Cuts Benefit Both U.S. And Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Monday that further reduction in U.S. and
Russian nuclear arms would save defense funds in both countries.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Cohen said the military, under orders
from Congress, was exploring a variety of options on nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"As I have indicated before, it is costly to the United States
to maintain those (START-1) levels" and "it is more costly to
Russia to maintain those levels," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"That is the reason why we have tried, on each and every
occasion, to persuade our Russian counterparts it is in their
interest, as well as the United States, to ratify START-2 as
quickly as possible so we can reduce the levels and then move on
to START-3," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was in response to a New York Times report Monday that
the Pentagon had quietly recommended in a report last April that
Congress consider unilateral cuts because of weakening security
threats and budget concerns.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen could not discuss the Times mentioned report because
it was "a highly classified document."
</P>
<P>
"We intend to keep it at that level for the time being," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Times quoted senior Clinton administration officials as
saying the proposed cuts would reduce the U.S. arsenal below the
6,000 nuclear warheads allowed by the first strategic arms
reduction treaty, or START I.
</P>
<P>
The second arms treaty, START II, signed by the United States
and Russia in 1993, would cut their arsenals to between 3,000 and
3,500 warheads. But the Russian Duma has refused to approve it.
</P>
<P>
The Times said the Pentagon believes that the unilateral
reductions would have no effect on the America's ability to deter
a nuclear adversary.
</P>
<P>
Because of the delay over START II, the Pentagon faces paying
hundreds of millions of dollars to maintain, and soon to rebuild,
nuclear weapons that the U.S. has agreed to scrap.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has spent 95 million U.S. dollars more over the
past two years than it would have if START II had taken effect,
the Times said. Next year it would cost 100 million dollars more,
and the year after after, one billion dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Navy may have to pay more than five billion dollars between
now and 2003 to refuel nuclear reactors and install new missiles
on four Trident submarines that would otherwise dismantled, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However the United States did not want to send the wrong signal
on unilateral cuts to Russia's Duma.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that there were signals from Moscow that the Duma
is moving toward approval of START-2 as early as December because
Russia cannot afford to maintain its present nuclear arsenal in
the throes of a devastating financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Records Smaller Deficit in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government had a
smaller deficit in October, indicating a good start for the new
fiscal year of 1999, the Treasury Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government began fiscal 1999 with a deficit of 32.5 billion
dollars in October. But that was down 9.7 percent from the 36
billion dollar deficit a year ago, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Spending, at 152.4 billion dollars, was 1 percent higher than a
year earlier. Revenue picked up 4.4 percent to 120 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The October deficit followed a surplus of 70 billion dollars
for all of fiscal 1998, which ended September 30. That was the
government's first year of black ink since 1969 and the largest
surplus, as a percentage of economic output, since 1956.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Falls Behind Others in High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
fallen behind many other industrialized countries in high school
graduation rate in the past six years with less pressure from job
opportunities, according to an international study.
</P>
<P>
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
a study found that over the past six years, 11 countries have
overtaken the United States in high school graduation rates.
By eighth grade, the lowest-scoring quarter of Japanese and
Korean eighth-graders still score above the average American
eighth-grader in math.
</P>
<P>
The study noticed that economic troubles, including high
unemployment, have motivated young people in many countries to
seek higher education as a way to compete the work force. But in
the United States, low jobless rate poses little presure on the
young people.
</P>
<P>
But the study found that United States still has the second
highest college graduation rate, 35 percent of the population at
the typical graduation age finishes college.
</P>
<P>
The United States also remains one of the highest spenders on
public education, five percent of the nation's gross domestic
product in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, a high school teacher in the United States with 15
years' experience earns 32,500 dollars on average, which is just
slightly more than the U.S. GDP per capita, lower than other
industrialized nations but the Czech Republic, Hungary and Norway
in terms of GDP per capita.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Security Strategy on Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday Asia's financial crisis had underscored the need to keep
100,000 U.S. troops in the vast Asia-Pacific region, reaffirming
its security strategy in Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
A new U.S. security report on East Asia and the Pacific
released by Defense Secretary William Cohen said that the release
of the report does not mean a change in U.S. Asia-Pacific security
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is not as confident as it was in 1995 when the Department
of Defense issued the last East Asian strategy report," Cohen told
reporters at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to maintaining stability. With stability
comes the prospect of economic revitalization is being more
likely," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 68-page report, the fourth in a series and the first in
three years, put high priority on Washington's defense and
economic cooperation with Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand,
Singapore and other allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with South Korea and China to engage North
Korea through the Four Party Talks on a formula for reducing
tensions and making the transition from armistice to lasting peace
on the Korean Peninsula," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that not only would the United States continue a
policy of "constructive engagement" with China on issues of mutual
interest, but wanted to encourage greater involvement in the
region by Russia, which is facing its own staggering economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is obviously an Asian power as well as a European
power," Assistant Defense Secretary Franklin Kramer told reporters.
"There's a section in this report, which I would commend to you,
which encourages that Russia be more involved."
</P>
<P>
It warned that economic and political difficulties in
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, will pose
challenges to established order throughout the region as well as
internally.
</P>
<P>
The report cited ongoing domestic crises in Burma and Cambodia
and warned that "historical mistrust and territorial disputes,"
including claims to islands in the South China Sea, are potential
flash-points of sovereignty and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted the region remains mostly at peace,
stressing that the presence of U.S. forces on land and at sea --
including nearly 37,000 in South Korea -- were a major stabilizing
factor in the equation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rebuffs Germany's Call on NATO Nuclear Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
rebuffed a suggestion by Germany's new government that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) declares it would not be the
first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Cohen said that the NATO reserves
the right to be the first side in any conflict to use nuclear
weapons is "an integral part" of the alliance's strategy.
</P>
<P>
"It is an integral part of our strategic concept and we think
it should remain exactly as it is," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It is something that is integral to the NATO strategic
doctrine. There is good rationale for keeping it as it is."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent the same
message to Rudolf Scharping, defense minister in the new
government of Socialist Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, during talks
in Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told Der Spiegel
magazine in Bonn over the weekend he had signaled to NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana that Germany wanted to discuss
alliance readiness to be the first to use nuclear weapons "because
we see things differently."
</P>
<P>
Fischer believed it was time to discuss doing away with the
right NATO reserves to be the first side in any conflict to
unleash nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Bonn that
Germany was not insisting on the point.
</P>
<P>
A senior department official said Albright would make it clear
to Germany "that we do not believe it would be wise to change
NATO's basic current strategic posture because it has served us
extremely well."
</P>
<P>
The official said NATO policy left any would-be aggressor with
"uncertainty" about a response and that "the arguments made in
favor of no-first-use are not justified by the analysis that goes
behind them.

<P>
AMMAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh said here Monday that Jordan will not be a party of the
final status negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Jordan will keep in touch with all the
concerned parties, especially the Palestinians, to coordinate
positions over the negotiations and safeguard its specific
interests.
</P>
<P>
One of Jordan`s major concern is the issue of Palestinians
refugees, said Tarawneh in a statement issued after a meeting
between top Jordanian officials and Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon and his delegation on trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the Palestinian authorities hold different views on
the issue and Jordan's interests have not been taken into
consideration so far, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Although Jordan hosts a large number of Palestinian refugees,
it can not be turned into a substitute homeland for them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan keeps close watch over the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks as its national interests are at stakes.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes that with the success of the talks, millions of
Palestinian refugees now staying in Jordan will return to their
homeland in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Algeria Coordinate Stances on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Oil Minister Ali
Al-Naimi held talks with his visiting Algerian counterpart Youcef
Yousefi Monday to coordinate stances on ways to shore up the
sagging oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Yousefi's visit to Riyadh was part of his four-nation Gulf
tour to brainstorm on how to boost oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The tour has taken him to Kuwait and Qatar and Yoursefi will
travel on to the United Arab Emirates after his visit to Saudi
Arabia, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yousefi Gulf tour came pending a meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to be held in Vienna next
Wednesday. The meeting will tackle the stagnant oil market, with
the oil prices hitting a 12-year low of less than 12 U.S. dollars
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Yousefi has conveyed letters from Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual to the leaders of the oil-rich Gulf countries his toured.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Ambassador to Riyadh Mohamd Taqih said that Zeroual's
letters made a clear-cut account of Algeria's views over the
chronic oil price crisis.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is seeking a unified stance among the OPEC member
states on the flagging oil prices which could undermine economies
of the oil producing countries, Taqih said.
</P>
<P>
There have been differences among the OPEC members on how to
prop up oil prices, with some members suggesting a further
reduction of oil output while others supporting the extension of
an agreement on oil yield cut.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC member states reached an agreement in June to slash
2.6 million barrels a day. The agreement was set to run for a
year.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts predicted no major actions will be taken at the
upcoming OPEC meeting, saying that most likely there will be an
extension of the current cut to boost the stagnant oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member OPEC was established in 1960 with a aim to unify
and coordinate members' petroleum policies and to safeguard their
interests generally.
