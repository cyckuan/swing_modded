<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Work for Resuming Bicommunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has pledged that Britain would continue to work actively
for a resumption of bicommunal talks for a Cyprus settlement on
the basis of the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Blair's pledge was contained in his reply letter to the
president of the World Federation of Overseas Cypriots, Haris
Sophoclides, Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in his letter that "the British government is
committed to using the UK's unique position -- as a guarantor
power, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and as a
member of the European Union -- to do all it can to assist the
people of Cyprus to achieve a just settlement on the island."
</P>
<P>
Britain, together with Greece and Turkey, is a guarantor of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister pointed out that it is only through
peaceful dialog that the division of the island can be ended,
urging all sides to refrain from acts of violence and aggression
and to cooperate fully with the U.N. secretary-general's efforts
to broker a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Turkish Cypriot proposal to set up a
confederation in Cyprus, put forward by its leader Rauf Denktash,
Blair said "we have made it clear that a confederation of
separate sovereign states is not consistent with the objective of
a bizonal, bicommunal federation agreed by both communities in
the 1977 and 1979 High Level Agreements and set out in the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the U.N. Security Council and the
international community have repeatedly endorsed the
U.N. secretary-general's efforts to promote negotiations aimed
at establishing a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the island through a bizonal, bicommunal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Cyprus' EU accession prospects, Blair said the
British government and its EU partners have made it clear that
the accession of Cyprus to the EU should benefit both
communities, reinforce efforts toward a settlement and help bring
about peace and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The British government, he said, continues to give this
process its strong support.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started accession negotiations with the EU in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
Blair also expressed his interest in seeing a reduction of
tensions in the Aegean, saying that Britain would continue to
encourage Greece and Turkey to adopt an "open and flexible
approach in discussing bilateral issues."

<HEADLINE> S. African Population Over 40 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa revised its
final results of the 1996 census Tuesday, putting the population
at 40.58 million.
</P>
<P>
In its preliminary census results released last year,
Statistics South Africa said the country had 37.9 million people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics South Africa chief Mark Orkin told reporters in
Pretoria that the revision became necessary after post census
research found that millions of South African had not been
counted during the Census '96, which started in October of that
year.
</P>
<P>
"In our preliminary estimates, the undercount relied solely on
the reports of the respondents," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our follow-up determined that rural respondents, mostly
larger families with less education and more mobility due to
migrant labor, tended to under-report people who might have been
absent during the census."
</P>
<P>
Orkin expressed belief that the latest census was relatively
accurate.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Ambassador Says to Settle Pinochet Row Amicably </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chilean ambassador to Britain
Mario Artaza said Tuesday that his government could try to settle
amicably the current argument on extraditing former Chilean
president Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to BBC radio early Tuesday, Artaza said that a Chilean
specialist on international law was travelling to Britain for
talks with British Foreign Office over the Santiago government's
contention that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"This (diplomatic immunity) is something we will continue to
discuss. They will try to reach a conclusion that will save faces
for everyone involved," Artaza said.
</P>
<P>
British police arrested Pinochet, who is in London for medical
treatment, over the weekend for alleged involvement in the torture
and murder of 79 Spanish citizens in the 1970s
</P>
<P>
Artaza noted that Chile and Britain would try to settle the row
amicably but he questioned why Pinochet, a former president,
should be questioned in Spain.
</P>
<P>
"Why should he (Pinochet) be answering to a court in Spain for
crimes that allegedly he committed in Chile?" Artaza asked.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday, Pinochet, who enjoys immunity from prosecution in
Chile as a lifelong senator, said that he was confident of
successfully opposing attempts to extradite him from Britain to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday on his behalf said: "Any attempt to
extradite him (Pinochet) from the United Kingdom will be
resolutely opposed. Both he and his family are confident of
success."

SANAA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Yemen Tuesday
refuted the allegation that there are U.S. navy bases in Yemen's
Aden province, pointing out the U.S. does not want any military
bases in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Rumours have it that there is a U.S. State Department document
circulating in Sanaa which mentions the existence of U.S. bases in
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
An embassy statement said some people have forged such a
document in a bid to damage the U.S.-Yemen relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Yemen share friendly ties and Washington supports
Yemen's democratization efforts through assistance, as well as
bilateral military cooperation program including now-and-then
visits by U.S. ships to Yemeni ports and joint exercises, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that there is a U.S.-Yemeni agreement on
Yemen's providing its navy facilities on Socatra island in Aden
Gulf for the U.S.. But both countries have denied such an
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Party's Election Rally Ends in Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Clashes erupted Tuesday
afternoon at the first rally held by the moderate Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (CEI) for the election of the
Experts Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Police intervened and there are no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
A dozens of CEI's supporters rushed into physical fighting
with several hard-liners, who upheld pictures of the Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to disturb the speech of
the CEI Secretary General Gholamhussein Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
An audience of 7,000 audience was angered by the behavior of
the hard-liners and shouted slogans against them at the rally
held in the basketball hall of the Shahid Shiroudi Sports Complex
in central Tehran.
</P>
<P>
They also shouted slogans supporting the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami and Karbaschi, former Tehran mayor, who was
ousted in July by the conservatives on charge of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
"Khatami, Khatami, We support you Khatami, Khatami, We love
you" the crowd chanted, "Karbaschi Hero, Iran's Amir Kabir (a
famous Iranian reformist in the 19th century)."
</P>
<P>
The clashes continued for about 20 minutes and a dozen of
policemen with masks and sticks entered the hall and dispersed
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, Karbaschi urged the Iranian nation to
participate in the election for the Experts Assembly on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Although there were some problems with the procedure to
screen the qualifications of the candidates (by the Guardians
Council), the people should turn out vehemently to exercise
their rights," the CEI secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election of the Experts Assembly has special
importance in the country since it is the Experts Assembly that
determines the country's supreme leader and review the leader's
performances.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's constitution, the 86-seat Expert Assembly
also has the right to dismiss the leader if it believes that the
leader has not carried out his duties.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated Guardians Council, empowered to
screen the qualifications of candidates for elections in the
country, was accused of taking side while carrying out its duties.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone has protest, he should go to cast his vote
in the election," Karbaschi said, "this is the right way to
express one's protest, it is not right to boycott the
election."
</P>
<P>
After some of their prominent candidates were rejected by the
Guardians Council, the left-wing or moderate factions refused to
announce their lists of candidates for the election. Some
candidates from the left-wing factions have even withdrawn from
the election campaigns in a protest to the screening policy of
the Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the CEI, well-known as a moderate party, insisted
that the people should perform their duties and show their
presence in the country's political arena.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will

<P>
PARIS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- France will send an investigation
team to Kosovo this week to assess the actual needs of refugees
for humanitarian aid, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The international community should immediately offer
humanitarian aids to scores of Kosovo refugees, who are now in an
austere situation, to help improve their living conditions and to
insure their personal safety when they return to their homes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team will also go to Montenegro, where
refugees are gathering, to do an on-the-spot investigation, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, also chairman of
the Contact Group on Yugoslav Issues, discussed his views on
sending the team to Kosovo with Kofi Annan, the
U.N. General-Secretary; Javier Solana, NATO General-Secretary, and
Bromislaw Geremek, the current chairman of the Organization for

<HEADLINE> Greece Warns European Commission Not to Release Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece warned Tuesday that
Athens would be forced to have recourse to the European Court of
Justice if the European Commission did not change its proposals on
the release of community funds for neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos in a letter to his Austrian counterpart Wolfgang
Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Pangalos strongly criticized the commission's
attempt to release the European Union (EU) funds for Turkey, and
asked Schuessel to intervene to prevent the adoption of the
commission proposals on the funds release, which Greece considered
to be legally unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The attempt was contrary to decisions taken at the EU summit in
Cardiff, Britain, he said, adding that a mistaken approach on the
part of the European Commission would in the future create many
problems.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Greece for years has been blocking about 405
million U.S. dollars of EU money destined for Turkey, which Greece
accuses of not meeting standards regarding human rights,
territorial claims and other issues.

<HEADLINE> Museveni, Mandela Talk About Congo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni had consultative talks about Congo Crisis with his South
African counterpart Nelson Mandela in Pretoria during his
three-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Museveni returned home Tuesday afternoon after the talks in
South Africa, a press release from the President's Office said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The day-long confidential talks between Museveni and Mandela
have focused on the widening conflict in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) as well as the situation in the region in general,
said the press release.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the talks in Pretoria were part of a series
of negotiations Mandela planned to hold over the next week with
key players in the war in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in South Africa, the Ugandan president also
had meetings with the South African Defense Minister Joe Modise
and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pohad, it added.
</P>
<P>
Before going to Pretoria, Museveni had met Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in Kenyan
capital Nairobi Sunday, calling for the peaceful withdrawal of
all foreign troops from the war-torn Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Mandela has also called for all-inclusive peace talks between
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the rebels, but Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe allegedly pushed for a military solution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the situation became more complicated after
the rebels recently took over the strategic town of Kindu which
is a major access to the mining areas in the east and south of
Congo. Kabila had tried to use this base to launch attacks on the
rebels who had occupied large tracts of land in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was accompanied to in his South Africa visit by his
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of Regional
Cooperation Amama Mbabazi.

<HEADLINE> UN: Over 800 Million People Suffer from Chronic Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 million
people suffer from chronic hunger or malnutrition, and 200 million
of them are children, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise
Frechette said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Frechette, delivering the speech on behalf of Secretary-General
Kofi Annan who is currently on a visit to Japan, made the remarks
as the United Nations marked the World Food Day, which falls on
October 16 each year, at its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The short-and long-term effects of hunger are well known," she
said, "People's capacity for growth and daily activity are
stunned. Hungry people cannot fulfill their human potential as
individuals, or as a society."
</P>
<P>
"This has devastating consequences both in economic and
political terms," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The world has enough food, as well as the technology and the
knowhow, to feed everyone," she said, "What is needed is a
collective political will."
</P>
<P>
A first step is to recognize fully the critical contribution
to food security that is made by women -- and to work to remove
the obstacles they face in carrying out their role, she said.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme for the World Food Day is "Women feed the
world."
</P>
<P>
In the face of poverty, natural disasters and war, it is the
resilience and ingenuity of women that enables families and
communities to survive, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to do justice to the daily struggle of rural women
and the multitude of obstacles and discriminatory practices they
face in accomplishing their daily workload, she said.
</P>
<P>
"What is even harder is the opportunities lost for growth and
development for many women, their families, and society.
Agricultural development policies still do not reflect the needs
of women adequately," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday activity to mark the World Food Day was presided
over by Didier Opertti, president of the 53rd General Assembly
session.
</P>
<P>
In his message for the World Food Day this year, Annan said,
"Every year, World Food Day reminds us of a tragic reality --
that the war against hunger and is still being fought."
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the General Assembly called for the observance of
the World Food Day for the first time on October 16, 1981 and
annually thereafter to heighten public awareness of the problem
of hunger in the world and to encourage attention to food
production.

<HEADLINE> Pressure for Rate Cut in Britain Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) - Evidence of economic downturn and
fall of business confidence in Britain will step up the pressure
on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for
further cut in rates, business leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, CBI (Confederation of British Industry)
Director-General said at a press conference this afternoon that
business confidence was now at its lowest point since the end of
1992.
</P>
<P>
Export confidence was at its lowest point for almost 10 years,
he said, adding it's up to MPC to take right step to prevent the
threat of recession.
</P>
<P>
Turner argued that Britain was now suffering from deflation,
not inflation. He said that CBI found little change in
manufacturing pay deals over the year, which suggests there is
little inflationary pressure coming from the UK's industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence has also shown its biggest slide since the
depths of the last recession but there is no sign of a let-up in
the urge to spend, says a survey out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Business Strategies quarterly consumer index shows the
balance of people feeling confident about the economy has slipped
by 16 percentage points to 11 percent in the three months to
October - the sharpest decline since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Melanie Lansbury, author of the survey, said: "People are
clearly worried about the coming year, and this is hardly
surprising with announcement of job losses becoming a regular
news..."

<HEADLINE> Schroeder's Government to Seek Better Control of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder said Tuesday that his new government would seek more
better international coordinations to improve the controls of
global financial markets in order to help prevent global economic
crises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after his Social Democratic Party
(SPD) and the Greens signed a deal to form Germany's first
center-left coalition government in 16 years, Schroeder announced
that one of the first tasks of his finance minister will be to
seek more cooperations with partner countries to improve the
controls of international financial markets and banks.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, the designated finance minister, said earlier
that the new government would forge a financial markets' stability
pact with France and Britain, including a drive for linked
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The plan of the new government represents a major policy shift
from the conservative government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which
favors a more free-market approach.
</P>
<P>
Political observers suggest that the change of government in
Bonn would provide the opportunity for the large majority of
leftist governments in Europe to move together to pursue a more
interventist policy.
</P>
<P>
As another reflection of the policy change in Bonn, Schroeder
indicated Tuesday that he would be willing to see the German
central bank, the Bundesbank, follow the example of the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board to cut interest rates in order to spur
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The politically independent Bundesbank has so far resisted any
rates cut and say that this does provide the right answer to the
actual problems faced by the world economy.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Starts Six-Day Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus started the annual
military exercise "Nikiforos '98" on Tuesday, with the
participation of the Greek Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reservists who enlisted for the six-day
manoeuvres, Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said the National
Guard's annual exercise gives the message that the Cyprus people
firmly support the defense of the island.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is the main objective of Cyprus and Greece in
the context of the joint defense pact between the two countries,
signed in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Greece will provide military assistance to
Cyprus in case the government-controlled southern part of the
island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Omirou said this year's exercise aims at "training the whole of
the armed forces, with emphasis on the reservists in war
situations."
</P>
<P>
All National Guard fighting services will participate in the
exercise, joined by Greek warplanes and navy ships, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Omirou also stressed that the message of the manoeuvres is to
let Turkey know of "the political, military, and economic cost she
will pay" in case of any attempt against the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement, the major part of the
exercise will take place in the southeastern district of Larnaca
with the use of live ammunition. The Greek warplanes are expected
to land at the "Andreas Papandreou" air base near the southwestern
town of Paphos, which was put to use -- only by Greek warplanes --
last February.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the participation of Greek warplanes
and ships may again heighten tension in this Eastern
Mediterranean island, which has remained divided since 1974 when
Turkey laned its troops and took over the northern third in the
wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Last year, after participation of Greek naval and air forces in
the same type annual exercise in Cyprus, Turkey sent military
aircraft and warships to the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern
part of the island for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to protect
the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Russia not to Consider Union with Yugoslavia Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia at present is hardly
to consider the implementation of making a union with Yugoslavia,
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said at a
briefing here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said the idea of Yugoslavia joining the
Russia-Belarus Union, put forward during the trip of members of
the State Duma to that country, is the reflection of friendly
feelings of the Russian and Yugoslav nations for each other.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian-Estonian relations, the spokesman said Russia
always called for development of the relations, which had recently
shown promising signs of positive change.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that this interaction with the new leadership of the
Estonian foreign ministry... will be hopeful to consolidation of
these shifts into a steady tendency," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed "indignation and extreme concern" about the Monday
explosion in Beer-Sheba, Israel, in which dozens of people were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin noted that "The bloody extremist sortie had the
evident purpose of escalating tension in Palestinian-Israeli
relations, provoking armed confrontation and thus torpedoing the
process of political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the relations between Iran and Turkey, he said
Russia resolutely stands for maintaining the territorial integrity
of the countries with a Kurdish population, including Iran and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is convinced that "the Kurdish problem cannot be
resolved by the use of force but a way out may be found only
through a political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Georgia's relations with its breakaway
Abkhazia province, the spokesman welcomed the Athens meeting
between the two sides. Delegations of Georgia and Abkhazia met in
Athens, Greece, on October 16-18 to generate trust-building
measures.
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the Athens meeting doubtlessly has a positive
meaning for reduction of the level of tension between the sides,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Rakhmanin, the meeting adopted a resolution which
laid down Georgia-Abkhazia accords on trust-building measures for
safe return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia, economic, cultural
and humanitarian cooperation.

<HEADLINE> 24 Coup Convicts Executed in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four officers and
soldiers convicted of involvement in the May 1997 coup have been
executed in Sierra Leone, reports from Freetown said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The execution were carried out Monday at about 4.30 p.m local
time, and were witnessed by about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
It is the first death sentences carried out in connection with
the coup in 1997 that overthrew elected President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, who was reinstated last March by the Nigerian-led west
African peacekeeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The 24 persons executed Monday were convicted of treason by a
Freetown court last week.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 persons, all officers, were convicted at the same
time, but have reportedly had their sentences commuted to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trial of the second batch of civilian
collaborators with the military junta ended in Freetown Monday,
with 16 of the 20 accused convicted of treason, murder and a
sC99j$KWV$M..HW.H3reed.
</P>
<P>
Another accused, Foday Sankoh, who was leader of the rebel
United Revolutionary Front, reportedly died in detention, but it
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh had been fighting against consecutive Sierra Leonean
governments since early 1990s. He was detained in Nigeria in
1997 and transferred to the Kabbah government for trial earlier
this year.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Stresses More State Control Over Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Tuesday stressed the need for more state regulation in
pulling the country out of the economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The theory that the market will resolve everything on its own
has not justified itself," said Primakov, addressing a conference
of the country's business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Before real market relations establish themselves in the
country, the state must assume regulatory functions, ensure order
in the country," Primakov told participants of the Ninth Congress
of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who took over as prime minister a little over a month
ago, said his government would support domestic producers through
its fiscal, tax and social policies, rather than offering more
credits.
</P>
<P>
"By merely pumping money (into the industrial sector), we will
never achieve economic growth," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Primakov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would strive to cut value-added tax and
profit tax and other measures to ease the tax burden of the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Arkady Volsky, the union's president, praised the Primakov
cabinet's moves.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the years of reform, there is a light at
the end of the tunnel, the light of hope, not of a mourning lamp,"
Volsky said.
</P>
<P>
He noted particularly the government's measures to enhance the
state's role in the economy, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's speech was also well received by Gennady Zyuganov,
leader of the Communist faction in the State Duma, or lower house
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He claimed, based on speeches at the Tuesday conference of
industrialists and entrepreneurs, that the government was
abandoning the economic policies pursued by its former reformist
governments, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said proposals to cut energy prices, transport charges and
taxes and to improve tax collection had particularly impressed
him.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and the People's Patriotic Union have been
demanding such measures for the last five years, Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Primakov told reporters after his meeting at
the Kremlin with President Boris Yeltsin that if a decision on
monetary emission, or printing money, is taken, the emission "will
be very small."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that printing more money is dangerous but "when the
money in circulation has a backing, there is very little danger or
no danger at all," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, who also took part
in the meeting, said that "not emission, but an enlargement of the
monetary base" guaranteed by the gold and foreign reserves" should
be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of trust in banks and active involvement of
the population's ruble savings in the economy are the most
important things," he said.
</P>
<P>
The moves for stronger role of the state and printing of more
money have worried the West, which argues that the steps would
fuel hyperinflation and could eventually result in social chaos.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the International Monetary Fund was to discuss
on Wednesday with the Russian government the possible release of a
4.3 billion U.S. dollar loan, the second tranche of the IMF's
stabilization package to Russia, Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Alexander Shokhin, who briefly handled Moscow's
negotiations with international lending agencies before quitting
the Primakov cabinet, said Tuesday that "money from the
International Monetary Fund should not be expected" before
January.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Second International
Consultative Meeting on Somalia was held here Tuesday in a bid to
facilitate an enabling atmosphere for peace efforts in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the half-day meeting, an International Standing
Committee on Somalia was set up to solicit funds necessary for
the implementation of the peace process and seek international
support for the cause, the Ethiopia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tekeda Alemu as saying that the path in the search for peace in
Somalia over the past seven years was "littered with
disappointments and missed opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Tekeda said the objective of this consultation is
to search ways and means of strengthening the internally existing
possibilities for peace and authority formation in Somalia and to
enhance mutual confidence and trust among external parties
committed to peace making in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The first consultative meeting on Somalia was held last March
in Djibouti during the summit of the Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
This meeting was attended by representatives of 36 embassies
in Addis Ababa and various international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Invites Hussein to Join Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
invited Jordan's King Hussein to join the Palestinian-Israeli
summit held in the U.S. to cash in on his good ties with both
sides to ensure its success, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The king will arrive at the Wye Plantation near Washington
late Tuesday evening and is expected to meet Clinton, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu separately, said Minister of Information Nasir Judeh
at a weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the king's meetings with these leaders are part of the
 ongoing efforts aimed at hammering out a Palestinian-Israeli
agreement on a U.S. peace proposal which calls on Israel to
withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in order to reactivate
the long-stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The king will use his good offices with both Arafat and
Netanyahu to bridge their gap on the U.S. proposal, Judeh added.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has been staying at a Minnesota clinic for some three
months to treat cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Plantation summit entered its sixth day on Tuesday
while the gap between the two sides was still unbridged over
some major issues.
</P>
<P>
The summit was proposed by the U.S. who pinned high hopes on
the Palestinians and Israel to reach an agreement and reactivate
their peace process which has been deadlocked since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, has been
maintaining frequent high-level contacts with both parties.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Get Loans for National Health Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim said Tuesday that the World Bank and the African
Development Bank are going to grand loans of 130 million U.S.
Dollars to assist in the implementation of the country's national
health program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Ethiopian News Agency, Adem said
prelimenary negotiations have been finalized to sign the
agreement providing for a 100 million Dollars loan from the World
Bank and nearly 30 million dollars from the African Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement with the World Bank is expected
to take place next week and the African Development Bank is soon
to submit its approval for the Bank's Board of Directors for a
final endorsement, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that other donors are also expressing
willingness to assist in Ethiopia's health program.
</P>
<P>
According to Adem, more than 50 percent of the fund needed to
execute health projects in the five-year program will come from
the Ethiopian government and the public and a budget of 5 billion
Birr (about 710 million dollars) has been allocated for the
program.

<HEADLINE> Red Crescent Official Attacked by Gunmen in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen have
launched an armed attack on the secretary-general of the Somali
Red Crescent Society (SRCS) in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place Monday night when Nur Hassan Hussein
(Nur Addeh) was presiding a meeting in the residence of Dr. Mina
Hassan, the director of the Keysaney Hospital run by the
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
According to the neighbors, more than 20 heavily-armed men
carrying rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles attacked
the house of Mina.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors also said that the heavily-armed guards at the
residence defended the area from the perpetrators and captured
two of the raiders with their guns.
</P>
<P>
At least two people were wounded, one of them a bystander,
during the attack which terrified the residential area of Shibbis
district in the capital.
</P>
<P>
There were no attacks or counter-attacks between the two sides
Tuesday and the situation seems to return to the normal.
</P>
<P>
There are no identity of the attackers. However, the
neighbors said they recognized some of the attackers, describing
them as the same kidnappers of the 10 ICRC aid workers who were
abducted in north Mogadishu in mid-April this year.
</P>
<P>
The Somali Red Crescent Society collaborates with the ICRC as
its partner in the capital in arranging or fulfilling several
humanitarian businesses on behalf of the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The reason for raid is not known, either. But sources close
to the gunmen said the action had something to do with the
released ICRC staff members after their captivity of nine days in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to a source, Nur Addeh who just returned to
Mogadishu this week had promised to pay the gunmen more money
when he returned, but he failed to keep his words.
</P>
<P>
There is no word as yet from the SRCS secretary-general or his
agency over the attack.
</P>
<P>
This has not been the first such attack against Nur Addeh in
Mogadishu. There was another attack against him at the residence
of Mogadishu's former mayor, Ali Ugas Abdulle, in Karan district
of north Mogadishu, which had been foiled by the guards.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official settlement over the issue between
Nur Addeh and the gunmen allegedly seeking him for money.
</P>
<P>
However, latest reports said that the elders from both sides
are busy trying to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of the 10 ICRC staff members in Mogadishu led to
the departure of all the international relief workers of the
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Mogadishu as a
sign expressing solidarity with the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The Somali capital still lingers with the humanitarian crises
resulting from the departure of the international NGOs from
Mogadishu after the abduction of the ICRC staff members.

<HEADLINE> Principles on Internal Displacement Urged to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop on
internal displacement in Africa ended Tuesday evening with a call
for the wide dissemination and application in Africa of the
guiding principles on internal displacement.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was jointly organized by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) to focus attention on internal displacement in
Africa and identify ways to improve the response at the regional
level.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAU statistics, there are about 20 million
internally displaced persons in Africa.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after the workshop, OAU Assistant
Secretary-General for Political Affairs Daniel Antonio said that
the situation of internal displacement in Africa "is still
serious."
</P>
<P>
On promoting the application in Africa of the Guilding
Principles on internal displacement which were presented to the
UN Commission on Human Rights this year, the workshop said that
these principles set forth the rights of the internally displaced
for protection and assistance and the obligations of governments
and insurgent groups toward these populations.
</P>
<P>
They serve as a valuable tool for addressing more effectively
the crisis of internal displacement in Africa, said the
participants.
</P>
<P>
Referring to exploring the role of regional and sub-regional
organizations in dealing with internal displacement, the workshop
encouraged them to develop a more active role with the internally
displaced, especially when there is a lack of any international
agency specificly responsible for the internally displaced.
</P>
<P>
The workshop called on the OAU as well sub-regional bodies to
actively disseminate and apply the principles, using them as a
basis for advocacy and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from international organizations, regional
bodies, non-governmental organizations and research institutions
engaged with internally displaced populations attended the
workshop.
</P>
<P>
Participants also made recommendations on internal
displacement in Africa to the OAU Ministerial Meeting on
Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons which will be held in
Khartoum, capital of the Sudan in December this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Immigration Department
said here Tuesday that it has deported 17 prohibited immigrants
including a German national from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
One Zambian and a Congolese (K) national were also arrested at
the Lusaka International Airport after they tried to travel to
the U.S. on forged Zambian passports.
</P>
<P>
Immigration public relations officer Catherine Poso also told
Zambia News Agency ZANA that another person is being held after
he was found in possession of blank certificates of status for
residence in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Poso said the three men were arrested Monday in Lusaka and
investigations are going on to establish the source of their
documents.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there is need to establish whether the
certificates of status found on the third man were stolen from a
government institution or they were printed by him.
</P>
<P>
The public relations officer added that the 17 people deported
last week mainly come from neighboring countries and west Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Department is now facing financial constraints
which is hampering the repatriation of prohibited immigrants to
their countries of origin, said Poso.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to human rights and non-governmental
organisations as well as embassies in Zambia to help in terms of
air tickets to ensure illegal immigrants especially from distant
countries are sent back.

a "tough hide, a dry wit, a lot of patience in dealing with the
president, hard-worn wisdom and a genuine compassion for improving
this nation."
</P>
<P>
Podesta, 49, has been deputy chief of staff for the past two
years. Prior to that he was a visiting law professor at Georgetown
University, and a top aide to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
a South Dakota Democrat. Earlier, he was a senior policy adviser
to Clinton. He also was Clinton's staff secretary.

"He knows how the White House works," said Clinton. "But even
more importantly, he knows why the White House ought to work and
for whom every single one of us does work. He entered public
service for the right reasons and he has certainly stayed there
for the right reasons."
</P>
<P>
Over the years Podesta has been constructing a communications
strategy for dealing with various controversies that have erupted,
including the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
Bowles had planned to resign earlier in the year but stayed on
to help Clinton with the Lewinsky matter. He has been considering
a possible run for governor in his home state of North Carolina
in 2000.

</P>
<P>
The trade deficit during the first seven months of this year

AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one Jordanians left here
Tuesday to visit their 12 relatives in an Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's visit is the first of its kind and is the result of
months-long efforts by Jordan's Royal Court and the Jordanian
government, the official Petra news agency quoted Assistant Consul
at the Jordanian Embassy in Israel Ahmed Ayasrah as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 14 Jordanian prisoners in the Ashkelon
Prison in Israel. Arrangements were not made for the other two of
them because they lost contact with their relatives, said
Ayasrah.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifai said earlier that
there are still other Jordanians being held in Israeli jails for
criminal offenses. But he did not give the exact figures.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two Arab countries which signed peace
treaty with the Jewish state. Since the signing of the treaty in
1994, Israel has released 20 Jordanian prisoners.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The armed wing of Islamic
militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility for Monday's
grenade attack in Israel, Israel Television reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the arrested suspect is a resident of the
Palestinian-controlled part of the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Salem Rajab Sarsour, 29, a Palestinian construction worker,
told the interrogators that he also killed a rabbi in Hebron last
month.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Sarsour was admitted into Hamas military
wing only after the killing of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan.
</P>
<P>
Sarsour was arrested after throwing two grenades into a bus
station of the town of Beersheba in Israel's southern Negev
Desert.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four Israelis were wounded in the attack and 27 people
still remained hospitalized on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Preventive Security Chief in the West Bank Jibil
Rajoub said earlier on Tuesday that Sarsour had some ties to Hamas
but acted alone in the attack.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Sarsour was well known to the Palestinian
security service and had been imprisoned twice by Israel during
the Palestinian uprising between 1987 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> FM: Cyprus to Ask Egypt to Exert Influence on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will ask Egypt to exert
its influence on Turkey in relation with the Cyprus question,
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the Larnaca Airport before his departure
for Cairo for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly ask of our friendly neighbor, Egypt, to
exert its influence on Turkey, just as we ask all those who have
the capability to do that," Kasoulides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will discuss with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa "issues of mutual interest, developments in
the Middle East peace process, the problem between Turkey and
Syria and of course the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
"We lay particular emphasis on our relations with all the
countries of the region and specifically Egypt, with whom we
maintain friendly ties even before the Cyprus Republic was
established," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides noted that problems in the region "are common
problems for all of us and we are interested in seeing peace and
stability in this region."
</P>
<P>
"In this context, it is wise to exchange ideas, particularly
with a friendly country, which is playing one of the leading
roles in the region for what is happening around us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the role of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
the disputes between Turkey and Syria, Kasoulides said "every
political personality that can exert influence on Turkey is
obviously a positive thing for us."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring Turkish outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party, but Damascus has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently shuttled between Turkey and Syria to try
to persuade the two sides to solve their disputes through dialog.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release here Tuesday, during his visit,
Kasoulides will convey a personal message from Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides to Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Promises to Punish Killers of Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy on Afghan
affairs Lakhdar Brahimi said here Tuesday that the Afghan Taliban
militia promised to identify and punish those responsible for
killing eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi made the remarks upon his arrival from Pakistan after
paying a visit to Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters in
southern Afghanistan, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban also asked him to convey the group's
regret over the bitter incident to the Iranian government and the
families of the killed Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Taliban troops reportedly stormed Iran's consulate in Mazari
Sharif in northern Afghanistan on August 8 and killed eight
Iranian diplomats and an IRNA reporter in the consulate.
</P>
<P>
Iran was angered by the move and massed more than 200,000
troops on its eastern borders with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to defuse the tensions between Iran and the
Taliban, Brahimi paid a shuttle visit to Iran, Pakistan and
Afghanistan in recent weeks. He returned to Tehran after the
Taliban released 26 Iranians arrested in Afghanistan and announced
readiness to talk with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. envoy did not give more details about his
talks with the Taliban leaders, but said that he would make
efforts to bring all the Afghan belligerent parties to
negotiations and to establish peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Brahimi at the airport, Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs Mohsen Amin-Zadeh voiced
Tehran's readiness to cooperate with the U.N. to bring peace to
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, King Hussein Join Mideast Summit in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Jordan's King Hussein joined on Tuesday the Palestine-Israel
summit talks as leaders from both sides tried for the sixth day to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"There are still gaps, significant ones," said U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin as the both sides worked on
drafting agreements at the Wye Plantation, in Maryland, 110 km
east of Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks had reached the "endgame" stage. "We are past
the atmospherics and down to hard bargaining," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides said a more businesslike approach had
returned after belligerent exchanges on Monday following a
Palestinian guerrilla attack on a bus station in Beersheba that
injured over 60 people.
</P>
<P>
"We're into a phase of very hard bargaining. Part of the
underbrush has been cleared away," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the end game that is getting more and more
serious. Some obstacles have been overcome but significant gaps
remain," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and their main aides
together on Monday evening, joined the talks after canceling a
fundraising trip to California.
</P>
<P>
He has attended for five of the last six days, an extraordinary
commitment of presidential time on a single initiative that has
also involved almost all his top foreign policy team.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, arrived
at the Wye River conference center in the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The king enjoys enormous respect in the region and has played
an important role in the peace process," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
U.S., Palestinian and Israeli sources said both sides were
working to secure a comprehensive interim agreement that would be
a prelude to ultimate "final status" talks on a permanent peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective remains the same, which is to reach agreement on
the interim issues, so that we can move to final status talks,"
said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
the king planned a session with Clinton this afternoon, Lockhart
said. Hussein will be available to join in the talks and will be
available where he can make a difference, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of progress, a senior U.S. official said "people are
rushing around and trying to come up with bridging ideas."
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
and Daniel Reisner, an Israeli legal expert, had resumed drafting
a tentative agreement after a three-day suspension, sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday hopes had been fading for an overall deal as
Netanyahu saying only a partial settlement might be possible and
some issues still left over for further talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat rejected that approach. Palestine Information Minister
Yasser Abed Rabo told reporters: "My fear is that there are gains
being made now to lead us to a partial accord. We will reject a
partial agreement "
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said although there was a new seriousness about
the discussions, they remained cautious and did not rule out a
partial deal being the best they could achieve.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Soar on Renewed Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets pushed
higher to close well up Tuesday on a host of factors ranging from
rises in Tokyo and New York, a stronger dollar to takeover
speculation and reports that rates in Emu member states would
converge at 3.3 percent rather than something higher.
</P>
<P>
Expectations of lower U.K. interest rates, together with a
bullish performance on Wall Street brought the FTSE 100 up by
174.4 points to end at 5251.9, after reaching a session best of
5267.9 in late trade.
</P>
<P>
Second-liners continued their solid, if unspectacular trend,
with the FTSE 250 rising 57 points to 4630.8.
</P>
<P>
A firm financial sector helped the index power ahead, as the
sector extended Monday's gains amid talk that Deutsche Bank was
mulling a takeover of the U.S. Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
"The banks did really well on Wall Street yesterday and a lot
of people who were short came rushing back in today," said one
trader. Only a handfull of top shares missed out on the party.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares moved ahead as increased investor
confidence fuelled a broad-based technical recovery. The leading
Dax index closed 137 points up at 4,595.
</P>
<P>
Dealers pointed to an absence of bad news, which seemed enough
to spur buy orders in a jittery market.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector soared on unconfirmed media reports that
Deutsche Bank is in preliminary takeover talks with Bankers Trust
of the U.S. Should the deal be agreed, it would be the largest
takeover of a U.S. bank by an overseas bank. There was also some
renewed optimism in the car sector.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares rose, too, on the back of a firmer
dollar and Wall Street's bullish lead. The Cac 40 closed up at
3,492, that's 97 points higher.
</P>
<P>
"Although the market is languishing in the absence of
market-moving news, the Cac 40 index is still heading for its
eighth consecutive rise," said a trader at Oddo brokerage house.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU-DHABI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Tuesday underlined the necessity of finding a peaceful
solution to the Syria-Turkey tension.
</P>
<P>
This came in a meeting between UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh
Sultan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Nabil Khaddam, visiting envoy of
Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations and
exchanged views on the Arab and Islamic efforts to establish peace
and stability and contain the differences between Syria and
Turkey, the UAE News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian envoy handed over a message from Syrian vice
president to al-Nahyan which covers bilateral issues and the
developments of the situation in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the message deals with the developments of
the Syrian-Turkish tension and the stance of the Syrian government
on it.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been accusing Syria of harbouring Kurdish rebels,
while Damascus criticized Ankara for forging military alliance
with Arab's rival Israel. Turkey has reportedly massed up troops
along the border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian envoy arrived here earlier on Tuesday on a short
visit and he will also visit Kuwait during his Gulf trip.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan Reject Partial Palestinian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, and Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday expressed
rejection of a partial agreement at the Palestinian-Israeli
summit at the Wye Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Jordan rejects "half solutions" and will make efforts to help
both sides achieve a comprehensive agreement over a U.S. peace
proposal which calls for Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of
the West Bank, Jordan's official news agency, the Petra, quoted
Hassan as telling Weizman during their telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said King Hussein has accepted an invitation from
U.S. President Bill Clinton to join the summit to use his good
offices with both sides to ensure that the summit will succeed in
reaching a comprehensive agreement.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that he has been keeping contacts with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to ensure that a comprehensive agreement rather than a
partial one will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Both Hassan and Weizman affirmed that a comprehensive
agreement is necessary because it will bring durable peace to
the region and avoid violence.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Plantation summit entered its sixth day on Tuesday
while Arafat and Netanyahu still could not bridge their gap over
some major issues.
</P>
<P>
The summit was proposed by the U.S. who pins high hopes on the
Palestinians and Israel to reach a comprehensive agreement over
its proposal to reactivate the Palestinian-Israeli peace process
which has been deadlocked since March 1997.

<HEADLINE> Angola in Severe Economic Austerity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Angola is facing grave
financial situation this year with serious current account
deficit, great difficulty to service its foreign debt as a result
of sharp fall in the prices of crude oil on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The Angola National Bank (its central bank) estimated in a
document issued Tuesday that the country's current account
deficit will reach 806 million U.S. Dollars this year, which is
about 12 percent of Angola's gross domestic products (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this, said the document, is that the price
of crude oil, the country's major export product, is down by 35
percent on the international market although its export has been
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil producing country in Africa
with a current daily output of 750,000 barrels. Oil export
earns 90 percent of the country's foreign currency. However,
the price for crude oil has fallen from 18 Dollars per barrel in
1997 to less than 12 Dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, said the document, Angola finds itself unable to
service a batch of foreign debt due this year and this delay in
debt servicing has in turn made foreign financial institutions
refuse to provide new loans.
</P>
<P>
The national bank estimated a 674-million-Dollar deficit in
balance of payments, a shortfall of 128 million Dollars in
foreign exchange reserve and an accumulated 546 million Dollars
in foreign debt for the southern African country this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank believed that the current financial situation in
Angola has brought great harm to the country's credibility on the
international financial market.
</P>
<P>
If the international price of crude oil cannot improve in the
recent future, the financial situation in the country will
further deteriorate, noted the document.

<HEADLINE> Actions Urged Against Foreign Workers in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan made an alarming
call Tuesday for GCC states to solve the issue of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan, who is attending the 15th meeting of the GCC
labor and social affairs ministerial council starting here
earlier Tuesday, said the problem of the expatriate workers
implicates dangerous impact at the social, economic and political
levels, and become much more complicated in the future, the Kuwait
News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with all these (foreign) communities, particularly if
their number increases in the future, will be extremely
difficult," Al-Hujailan said.
</P>
<P>
Voicing concern on the expatriates' impact on the Gulf social
customs and traditions, he said "the sole solution is replacing
foreign laborers with nationals."
</P>
<P>
The GCC chief confirmed that the GCC Higher Council, which
comprises top leaders of the Gulf states, has decided to make the
issue a permanent topic in the agendas of GCC ministerial meetings.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the GCC labor ministers have concluded that
the private sector is one of the main parties involved in this
problem.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan urged private companies to employ nationals instead
of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign workers in the Gulf region is estimated
at 5 million, approximately one fifth of the 26 million
population of the GCC states, Kuna said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Striking Teachers Urged to Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Education Minister
Godfrey Miyanda Tuesday called on the striking teachers to return
to work and give the government and teachers' unions a chance to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said the on-going strike is without the blessings of
the government nor the teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
The strike is not only illegal but also in bad faith, he said,
adding the teachers had been addressed earlier by President
Frederick Chiluba, who announced the commencement of
negotiations and the lifting of the wage freeze next year.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda urged the teachers to exercise wisdom and patience to give
the government a chance to address the issues.
</P>
<P>
The minister dismissed the teachers' demand for better
conditions of service and salaries as unrealistic and
unattainable.
</P>
<P>
Better conditions or salaries cannot be implemented this year
and therefore there must be a different agenda for the boycott,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the problems of teachers have beset
his ministry for years and a solution can be found through
sitting down together and talk.
</P>
<P>
The strike has been harmful to the children, said Miyanda, who
called on the teachers not to fall prey to what he described as
those who "fly by night" and have taken advantage of this situation
to cause confusion among teachers.
</P>
<P>
The teachers went on strike last week demanding a review of
their conditions of service and an increase in monthly salaries
currently pegged at 100,000 Kwacha (about 50 U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM: Syria Pledges to Shut Down PKK Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Syria Tuesday pledged to shut
down camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) on its
territory and in the Syrian-controlled Bekka Valley, Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said here.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by high-ranking diplomatic and
military officials of Turkey and Syria, Damascus also agreed not
to allow the PKK militants to launch cross-border attacks on the
Turkish territory, Cem said.
</P>
<P>
Cem's remarks came after high-ranking officials from both
countries ended a two-day secret security meeting held in
Turkey's southern province of Adana.
</P>
<P>
Both sides held the meeting to ease their mounting tensions
in the past three weeks after Turkey claimed that it would take
decisive measures against the PKK camps in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz confirmed that
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan "has been spotted in a Moscow suburb."
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey "has already made all necessary
diplomatic efforts to Russia to ask the extradition of the PKK
leader."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK which has
been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey. But Syria has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Syria has criticized Turkey for forming a military alliance
with Israel, which it said threatens Arab security and undermines
its bargaining positions in negotiations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has massed heavy forces along the Syrian border and
issued an ultimatum, threatening to uproot PKK bases in Syria by
force if Damascus fails to stop supporting the PKK within 45
days.

<P>
Halliwell, 26, quit the Spice Girls, the hugely popular
all-girl British pop group on May 31.
</P>
<P>
"I am incredibly honored to be named a Goodwill Ambassador
for the United Nations Population Fund," said Ms. Halliwell,
accepting the appointment at the United Nations Headquarters in
New York.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've entered the media arena I've always stood
for the empowerment of women, that's what the U.N. Population Fund
is about and I will be promoting the empowerment of women in
developing countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Halliwell will be working in partnership with Marie Stopes
International and Population Concern in the United Kingdom,
voluntary organizations which promote reproductive health, as part
of UNFPA's "face to fact" campaign with European organizations to
raise concern about reproductive health and rights, especially for
women.
</P>
<P>
The "face to face" campaign has the common aim of sensitizing
the public to the need for universal reproductive health care
and the empowerment of women.
</P>
<P>
Another objective of the campaign is to ensure that population
assistance for developing countries from donor nations is
maintained or augmented.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
Tuesday paid tribute to Northern Ireland's historic peace
agreement, saying reconciliation was the cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
Havel, who is on a four-day visit to Britain, visited Northern
Ireland early Tuesday and met Protestant and Catholic politicians
who negotiated the so-called Good Friday Agreement on April 10.
</P>
<P>
"What is much more important than technical procedural aspects
of arrangements is the underlying idea, the underlying commitment
to peace, to human rights, to human liberties, to mutual respect
between people coming from different traditions -- the idea which
makes up arrangements just agreed here in Northern Ireland," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Havel stressed that reconciliation was its cornerstone and he
wanted through his voice and presence "to add strength to the idea
behind the peace process, to the idea of reconciliation in
Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
He also congratulated Northern Ireland's First Minister David
Trimble and Catholic nationalist leader John Hume on being
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last Friday for their joint efforts
at creating stability in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia, Herzegovina Mired in External Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia and Herzegovina may have
to raise new loans to clear its old debts, a report released
Tuesday by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economy indicated.
</P>
<P>
The report said the country does not have the ability to pay
its external debts on time which amount to 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economy
Nikola Grabovoc said enterprises in the country may have to
struggle to the year 2036 to clear all the debts they owe.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement with the country, once enterprises
are in arrears with their debt payments, the government should be
held responsible.
</P>
<P>
Grabovoc said the three-people entities in the country have
agreed that under the above-mentioned circumstance, each entity
should pay its debts respectively.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that members of the Paris Club of
Creditors have indicated that they may call off the 686 million
dollars in debts that Bosnia and Herzegovina owed before war broke
out in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to official information from related institutions,
Bosnia and Herzegovina must annually repay 140 to 150 million
dollars of matured debts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country recorded a remarkable trade deficit with
an annual export volume of 130 million dollars against a
1-billion-dollar import volume.
</P>
<P>
The war-torn country's economy has been mired in debt in the
recent past with a gross national product of only 15 percent of
what it was in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New House Construction Declines in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide new
house construction declined for the second consecutive month in
September, the Commerce Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Builders started work on homes and apartments at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.58 million last month, down 2.5 percent
from August. Construction starts had hit an 11-year high of 1.70
million in July, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
In another sign that the housing construction market probably
reached a peak in the summer, housing permits plunged 4.5 percent
in September, the largest decline since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
In September, housing starts in the South dropped 8.6 percent,
the largest decline since May 1997, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 709,000. Analysts believed that the Hurricane
Georges set back builders in Mississippi, Louisiana and other
parts of the South.
</P>
<P>
Starts also fell in the Northeast, down 3.6 percent to a rate
of 135,000. But they rose 5.6 percent in the West to 414,000 and
3.2 percent in the Midwest to 318,000.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the decline was steeper for apartments, down 9.1
percent to a rate of 330,000, than for single-family homes, down
0.6 percent to 1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey report, the National Association of Home
Builders said traffic of prospective buyers through model homes
fell sharply this month, though sales remained good.
</P>
<P>
Both new and existing homes have been selling strongly this
year, supported by mortgage rates sinking to levels unseen since
the 1960s and by low unemployment and strong income growth. The
remarkable stock market gains through midsummer also gave some
buyers the wherewithal for down payments on larger homes.
</P>
<P>
However, overseas financial chaos has begun to slow U.S.
economic growth, and the stock market, despite a rebound over the
past week, is still well off its mid-July peak.

NEW DELHI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- There is a phenomenal
increase in orthopedic problems in New Delhi, capital of India,
due to increase in life span and "modernization", experts said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With average life expectancy increasing up to 60 years in India
as against 45 years at the time of the country's independence in
1947, two problems facing the metro are breaking bones and

</P>
<P>
The disease of "porous bone" osteoporosis is making inroads as
a "silent epidemic" with about 35 percent of post menopausal women
getting affected, they said.
</P>
<P>
In order to take stock of the situation and lay emphasis on
adequate training of professionals to deal with the disease, a
two-day meeting of orthopedists from across the country and abroad
will be convened on October 24 and the meeting will be preceded by
four workshops in different hospitals in the capital, they said.

<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has indicated that his country is prepared for the first
time to give European Union (EU) a defense role in conducting
peacekeeping missions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in an interview with Wednesday's The Times newspaper
that Britain was ready to drop Britain's long-standing objections
to the EU having a defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Blair noted that he would put forward some concrete proposals
on promoting EU defense capability at the EU special summit due to
be held in Austria over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair made it clear that he was not talking about a
setting up a permanent "European army", which would be put under
direct command of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing must happen that in any way impinges on the
effectiveness of NATO. NATO for us is the absolutely correct
forum," Blair said, but adding the Kosovo crisis had underlined
the need for Europe to take a very hard-headed view and make sure
that it could fulfill its responsibilities properly.
</P>
<P>
"We should be prepared to think more boldly and more
imaginatively about how we do that. All I am saying is that we
need to allow fresh thinking in this," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for Britain to be part of that thinking and
not for us simply to stand there and say we are not part of this,"
he added.

Palestine-Israel summit talks, which run inton a seventh day in
rural Maryland.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will brief President
Bill Clinton on the Middle East peace talks in rural Maryland, and
could advise him to return to the meeting site, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"By early this afternoon, she'll make a judgment on whether
they need to continue working among themselves there today or
whether it would be useful and productive for the president to
return," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who have been staying in the Wye Plantation,
Maryland, 110 km east from Washington, was expected to brief
Clinton by telephone, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also discounted media reports of an imminent deal
in the talks between Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
"I would dissuade you from the sense that there is some deal on
the table," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has travelled to Wye Plantation, a conference center on
the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, for five of the six
completed days of the peace talks, and could go there again if
Albright thinks it would be productive, Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Reports had said that some progress has been achieved in the
talks and leaders are expected sign an agreement on Thursday at
the White House.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME October (Xinhua) -- Italy's 56th government since World
War II took office Wednesday with the swearing in of the new Premier
Massimo D'Alema and a government which includes the
first Communist Cabinet ministers in half a century.
</P>
<P>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro officiated over the ceremony in
the Quirinal Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Italy's first ex-communist premier conferred
with the speakers of the Lower House and Senate on putting
confidence votes on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
After a 30-minute talk with Italian Senate Speaker Nicola
Mancino, D'Alema said he intended to ask for the confidence test
in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
"within the week, I asked Mancino to move as quickly as possible
because the timetable for the budget is pressing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his new cabinet, he said, "I think a balance has
been found between the requirement of political representation in
a coalition government and personal qualities and skills."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema noted that the government includes a number of people
who are not strongly associated with political parties and that
the number of women has been raised to six. "A correct and
necessary commitment, a signal to the country."
</P>
<P>
He also named Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Giuliano Amato, at the
treasury and new institutional reform portfolio, as among those
ministers of "prestige, representing the country's various
cultural areas, Socialist, Catholic, and the secular and liberal
world."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of difficulties he encountered in forging a government
based on a coalition which ranges from a small Marxist party to
Catholics in ex-President Francesco Cossiga's ODR, D'Alema said,
"There was no drama, only the problems which normally appear in
these cases."

<HEADLINE> Rules for Clinton's Impeachment Inquiry Under Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers from the White House
and the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives will
meet Wednesday to discuss how the House impeachment inquiry of
President Bill Clinton will be handled.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called it a "preliminary
meeting" to find out the "rules of the road" for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
No major decisions about who will testify and whether the
hearings will be open or closed are expected to come
from the meeting or even before the November 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
The panel's republicans will urge the White House to expedite
the inquiry by agreeing to basic facts in Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The republicans also plan to ask White House lawyers for the
exculpatory information they have and will explain their rights
during the inquiry, including their ability to attend all sessions
and to ask witnesses questions.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the committee argued that Starr should be
subpoenaed to testify and criticized him for not disclosing his
contacts with lawyers for Paula Jones, who has a sexual-harassment
suit against Clinton, before he began investigating the Monica
Lewinsky matter.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- D.C. United midfielder Ben
Olsen, who left the University of Virginia to join Major League
Soccer's developmental program, was named the U.S.league's rookie
of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a vote of MLS's coaches and general managers, Olsen was
chosen over two other finalists. The 21-year-old played 31 of 32
regular season games, starting 24.
</P>
<P>
His four goals and eight assists weren't as impressive as some
of the other rookies' statistics, but his speed, crossing ability
and steady influence on the right side of midfield were dazzling
at times for the two-time defending champions.

<P>
GENEVA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The four-party talks on the
Korean Peninsula issue resumed here on Wednesday after a six-month
break.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at initiating a new mechanism for peace
instead of an armistice in the Korean Peninsula, were attended by
representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea(DPRK), South Korea, China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qian Yongnian, who is also the Chinese delegation
leader, said in his opening statement that the talks have entered
a key phase. He urged all parties to face reality and make joint
efforts to push the talks forward in a frank, sincere, pragmatic
and flexible manner.
</P>
<P>
There still exists tension and confrontation in the Korean
Peninsula, which is a result of the cold war in the Peninsula and
mutual distrust among all sides, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all sides to proceed from a sense of urgency and
responsibility to promote the talks, while cherishing the fruits
that have already been secured.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation will keep in close contact through
consultations and cooperation with all sides and do its best to
help create a peace mechanism in the Korean Peninsula as quickly
as possible, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Charles Kartman from the United States, South Korean
deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye-Gwa, and the DPRK's Ambassador
Park Kun-Woo also expressed their views at the opening
ceremony. They all stressed the willingness to strengthen
cooperation and overcome difficulties. They also pledged to make
active efforts to make progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Secretary of Foreign Affairs Jakob Kellenberger, on
behalf of the host, also delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
The talks, scheduled to end on October 25, are chaired by South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Pakistan's Precondition for No-War Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An External Affairs Ministry
spokesman said Wednesday that India has rejected Pakistan's
precondition of seeking a successful resolution of the Jammu and
Kashmir issue for negotiating a no-war pact.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's offer was formally made to India during the foreign
secretary-level talks in Islamabad last week with the rider that
such a pact could be negotiated only after successful resolution
of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Re-introduction of the caveat is not acceptable to us as it
negates the very concept of a non-aggression pact," he said adding
that India could not accept any such linkages.
</P>
<P>
During the foreign secretary-level talks last week, both India
and Pakistan had put forward their proposals on confidence
building measures.
</P>
<P>
India's proposals included agreement to prevent nuclear
conflict through accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear
weapons, assurance that flight tests would not be in each other's
direction, cessation of firing incidents on Line of Control and
asking Pakistan to forthwith stop aiding and abetting terrorist
activities in India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's proposals included setting up a nuclear risk
reduction center, bilateral agreement on banning nuclear tests,
acceptance of a minimum nuclear deterrent, prevention of violation
of air space and territorial waters and revival of pre-Simla
agreement border ground rules, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to be Successful in Economy: U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- United States ambassador
to Tanzania Rev. Charles Stith said here Wednesday that Tanzania
is set to become an economically prosperous country.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is poised to be Africa's successful economic story,"
said Stith, in the first press conference he held in Tanzania
since he came to office last month.
</P>
<P>
Stith cited three reasons which will lead to the success of
Tanzania, one of the poorest country in the world.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, Tanzania enjoys high level of stability as
opposed to neighboring countries like Burundi, Rwanda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Even some east European countries cannot compare to Tanzania
in this regard, the U.S. diplomat said at his residence.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Tanzania has viable democracy, he said, noting that
the country has completed peaceful transition of power after free
elections with a good political climate like free press.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Tanzania is a big country with rich natural resources
where foreign companies are willing to invest, Stith said, adding
that he was encouraged by the spirit of mining developers in
several areas he toured.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania can become an economy like South Africa in the
continent, said the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
However, Stith suggested that Tanzania should try to eliminate
corruption, saying "any corruption is much corruption."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the United States will develop relations
with African countries based on trade other than simply on aid
which might be a burden.
</P>
<P>
On the investigation of the bombing at the U.S. embassy on
August 7, Stith said that it is proceeding as more evidence is
collected day by day.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not rest. We'll not relent until those responsible for
committing the crimes are brought to justice," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack on the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam killed 11
people and injured more than 70 others. Two suspects, an
Egyptian national and a Tanzanian has been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dudley O. Sims, the director of the United States
Information Service (USIS) in Tanzania, told Xinhua at a
refreshment after the press conference that the blast was not
caused by a bomb buried in a water tanker as previously believed,
because the body of its driver was found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Had the powerful bomb been buried in the water tanker, the
body of the driver could have been blasted into pieces with few
traces, he further explained.
</P>
<P>
He said FBI believes that two vehicles have been used by
bombing suspects, one was a refrigeration truck, the other is a
smaller Suzuki Samurai used for transporting explosives.
</P>
<P>
The truck may follow the water tanker when the blast occurred,
he said, adding that the vehicle may have burst into pieces at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian police and FBI are still tracking the smaller
vehicle which remains at large, said Sims.
</P>
<P>
He also said the accurate time of the bombing was 10:39 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture to Improve Power Supply in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique, South Africa and
Swaziland set up a joint venture MOTRACO recently, which is set
to improve the power supply in south Mozambique and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
According to Wednesday's Noticias, with a capital of 40
million U.S. Dollars, MOTRACO will mainly provide electricity to
MOZAL, a Mozambican aluminum company, apart from meeting the
needs of power for southern Mozambique and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's EDM and South Africa's ESKOM hold one third of
the shares in the venture respectively while the rest goes to
Swazi and other share-holders.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Mozambican and South African firms signed
the agreement on the establishment of the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Juliao Pondeca who is in charge of MOTRACO, said a 900-km
transmission line worth 130 million U.S. Dollars will be put up
between South Africa and the Beloluane Power Substation near
Maputo, capital of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the power will come from Cahora Bassa
Station in northwest Mozambique. Once the price of electricity
is settled, power will go to South Africa, and again via the
transmission line in South Africa to Maputo if Mozambique in turn
agrees to buy the electricity from South Africa's ESKOM.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland will benefit from the line because part of it will
pass through the kingdom. For this a transformer will be built in
Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Armenian Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China hopes for peace and
stability in the Caucasus, which will benefit all countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made this remark today in a meeting with
Armenian Defense Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Armenia's domestic situation and its international
environment have been improving after a period of difficulty, and
China is delighted to see it.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes that Armenia will consolidate its achievements
and maintain a sustained development.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Li said, Sino-Armenian ties have been
growing smoothly since the establishment of diplomatic relations
six years ago, and the areas of cooperation have been expanded.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the agreements signed between the two countries
on economy, trade, science, technology, culture, education and
civil aviation have laid a solid foundation for further
collaboration. He added that China takes a positive attitude
toward developing relations with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Sarkisyan noted "successful talks" with his Chinese counterpart
General Chi Haotian on Tuesday, and said that he and Chi agreed to
deepen cooperation between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the two countries will
intensify their cooperation in economy, trade and mineral-
resources exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Sarkisyan said that Armenia places priority on its relations
with China in its foreign policy. He also conveyed an invitation
from Armenian Parliament Speaker Khosrov Arutyunyan to Li Peng to
visit Armenia.

<HEADLINE> Canada's National Railway to Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian National Railway
Co. (CN) will slash 3,000 employees from its work force this year
and the next in its latest drive to improve efficiency, reports
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company announced the job cut late Tuesday in the face of
one of its toughest financial quarters since it became a public
company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to become the most efficient railroad in North
America," CN President Paul Tellier said, adding that he had
accelerated the pace of job-cutting due to the faltering world
economy.
</P>
<P>
Tellier attributed the layoffs to new technology and other
improvements at the railway.
</P>
<P>
CN is running faster and longer trains and is withdrawing about
500 locomotives because of the higher productivity. This allows
it to reduce the number of employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the railway lost a lot of business during
the General Motors strike this summer. And the Asian economic flu
has also cut into exports of coal, grain and other commodities,
which were often moved by rail.
</P>
<P>
The job cut was blamed as "greedy" by the Union of Canadian
Auto Workers. "The only thing that matters now is shareholder
value and executive's bonuses, and Tellier does very well with
those," said Buzz Hargrove, head of the union.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Apparel Textiles Show Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 exhibitors from
25 countries and regions are showing their latest collections of
apparel textiles and accessories at Interstoff Asia Autumn 1998.
</P>
<P>
The three-day show at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center is a platform for trading companies, manufacturers, agents,
buying offices, designers and press from around 80 countries and
regions to gain a general overview of the market, to gather
information on fashion trends, to make new contacts and make
orders.
</P>
<P>
Interstoff Asia is the international marketing event in the
Asia-Pacific region for apparel textile products and services. The
fair, organized by international trade fair organizer Messe
Frankfurt, is in its 12th year.
</P>
<P>
One third of exhibitors are from Europe, America and Australia,
with two thirds from Asian countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
On the products side, 19 product groups are represented, with
knitted fabrics ahead of woven fabrics and cotton fabrics just
ahead of fabrics produced from man-made fiber.
</P>
<P>
Leading a new trend this year is the product group "functional
fabrics", which are best known in conjunction with such
applications as in activewear garments for high-performance sports
or for protective clothing for hazardous work environments.
</P>
<P>
Functionality will be a central theme catwalk trend show
presented by Austria-based fiber manufacturer Lenzing.
</P>
<P>
Interstoff Asia and the related Trend Forum provide, at a time
for the transition into the 21st century, essential information
for trade visitors looking ahead to the feel for the coming
season, and the first impressions of the new millennium around the
corner. Some experts had already picked up "Contemporary",
"Leisure Time" and "Future" as the three themes which will embody
a balance of such factors as the complex mix of social relations,
daily needs, materials, colors, feelings and time which influence
consumers and form the fashion outlook for Autumn-Winter
1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
The visitors will get a bonus as well since they could visit
the neighboring International Trade Fair for Yarns and Fibers or
Interyarn, with over 20 exhibitors from eight countries and
regions taking part.

<HEADLINE> Fifth HLHL Prizes to Be Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ho Leung Ho Lee (HLHL)
Foundation has decided to cancel a scheduled ceremony marking its
fifth anniversary because of the summer floods.
</P>
<P>
The HLHL Foundation will present awards to this year's prize
winners tomorrow at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, said
Duan Ruichun, member and secretary general of the Foundation's
Selection Board.
</P>
<P>
The HLHL Foundation was registered in Hong Kong in March of
1994 with 400 million HK dollars donated by Dr. S.H. Ho,
Dr. Kau-Kui Leung, Dr. Ho Tim and Dr. Quo-Wei Lee.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation is considered the largest support group for
science and technology from both at home and abroad. It bestows
two awards, one for science and technology achievement, and the
other for progress in science and technology. Winners of the first
award will receive one million HK dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The former award is granted to those who have worked for the
promotion of science and technology in China for a long time, made
significant contributions, and scored world-class achievements in
their academic fields. The latter award is granted to those who
have made important inventions or made discoveries in specific
areas, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation, following the Nobel Prize selection process,
consists of some 1,400 domestic and overseas experts. Two teams of
eminent scientists make first and final selections of the winners
through secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
The HLHL Foundation has granted 13 outstanding scientists with
achievement awards, and 173 excellent scientists with progress
awards since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Quo-Wei Lee expressed his intention of supporting Chinese
scientists with a special foundation at a meeting with
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
This intention was turned into reality after 10-months of joint
efforts of various sectors in Beijing and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad occasion when the list of the first group of award
winners was faxed from Beijing to Hong Kong to Dr. Kau-Kui Leung,
a founder of the foundation, who had passed away on November 10,
1994 at the age of 91.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji highly praised the HLHL Foundation and the four
founders and their relatives, saying their "noteworthy and noble
conduct will not only benefit the present, but also find favor far
into the future."
</P>
<P>
Donators and their relatives expressed the hope that the HLHL
Foundation will play a more significant role in advancing
scientific research and training professionals and that, in turn,
Hong Kong will benefit from its scientific and technological
advancement.

<HEADLINE> Assault Accusers Seek Settlement with Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson got his boxing
license back and now he's trying to avoid another court date.
</P>
<P>
Two men who have accused Tyson of assaulting them after a
minor traffic accident on August 31 in Montgomery County,
Maryland, near Washington D.C., are negotiating a financial
settlement, according to their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
They also want Tyson to get psychiatric help, not punishment.
The former heavyweight champion's defense attorney, Paul F.
Kemp,has said he has asked Montgomery County prosecutors to have
Tyson's second-degree assault charges dismissed if the alleged
victims agree to a "compromise."
</P>
<P>
"We are at the stage where we believe we will be able to
resolve our civil claims," said Glenn Culpepper, a lawyer for one
of the men, Abmielec Saucedo.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's probation status for an Indiana rape could be affected
by conviction in the Maryland assault cases.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have as an objective to punish him or put him in
jail or strip him off his livelihood," said Roger W. Titus, an
attorney for the second man, Richard Hardick.
</P>
<P>
Titus said both men had filed criminal complaints against
Tyson to achieve three goals: for Tyson to apologize, for the
boxer to get help for whatever made him allegedly attack them
after the accident and for him to compensate them financially.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who has pleaded not guilty, is set to go on trial for
the two misdemeanor assault charges on December 1. If convicted,
he faces a maximum 10 years in prison on each charge.
</P>
<P>
During a hearing before the Nevada State Athletic Commission,
which voted Monday to return his boxing license, Tyson said he
"didn't really hit anybody".
</P>
<P>
Neither Titus nor Culpepper would comment on the size of the
financial agreement being negotiated.

<HEADLINE> Compensation Paid for Vessels Used to Plug Dike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The city government of
Jiujiang in east China's Jiangxi Province paid 3.07 million yuan
Wednesday to compensate for vessels used to plug a burst dike
of the Yangtze River during the summer floods.
</P>
<P>
A section of the city's defence embankments collapsed on August
7, and in the following days local authorities held up 10 vessels
of various kinds to fill up the gap in the line, in accordance
with anti-flood law.
</P>
<P>
On September 22, the city government has sent an expert team to
assess the losses to the ship-owners, and it was finally decided
to pay for eight of them, as the owners of the other two had
volunteered to donate their boats.
</P>
<P>
The compensation also covers four other vessels that were
partly damaged while being used to transport materials to plug
the burst.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang burst was one of the most serious incidents during
the two-month nationwide efforts to combat the severe floods, the
worst since 1954. The floods claimed 3,004 lives and affected more
than 230 million people.
</P>
<P>
According to previous reports, no casualties were caused by the
Jiujiang incident, but at least 40,000 soldiers were involved in
the plugging and other activities to save this industrial and
tourist city. The cause of the burst is still under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks Better WTO Dispute Settlement System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 21 (xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
proposed to raise the transparency and efficiency of the dispute
settlement procedures in the World Trade Organization (WTO), a
news release from the EU headquarters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU submitted a total of 24 suggestions, the major of which
included creating a standing body of professional panelists,
improving transparency, giving greater weight to consultations,
and speeding up procedures.
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, which forms part of a general review of the
dispute settlement system currently taking place in Geneva, the EU
mainly stressed the importance of improving transparency in the
WTO system.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes greater transparency is essential in
making dispute settlement rulings more acceptable to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said the need for transparency increased in recent
years, as the WTO rulings touched on sensitive issues, such as the
public health and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The EU also wants the WTO rulings to be made available faster to
the public in the three official WTO languages.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh expressed his appreciation of the Yemeni-U.S. cooperation in
the military and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Saleh made the comment during a meeting here Wednesday with
Admiral Charles William Moore, commander of the Middle East
central naval force and commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yemeni News Agency, their meeting dealt with
bilateral relations and areas of cooperation, foremost among which
was their military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Saleh praised the military cooperation in training, exchange of
expertise and mine sweeping, saying it symbolized the overall
friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He further expressed Yemen's interest in promoting relations
with U.S. to "meet the expectations of the two peoples and ensure
common interests."
</P>
<P>
Moore congratulated Saleh and Yemeni people for the favorable
international arbitration which enabled Yemen to reclaim
sovereignty over most of the southern Red Sea Hanish islands, at
the center of a dispute with Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Chosen as Caltex Global Corporate Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 21 (Xinhua)-- Singapore has expressed its
welcome to an announcement Wednesday by a U.S. oil company that
the city state has been selected to relocate its global corporate
headquarters, the first of its kind in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Caltex Petroleum Corporation, a U.S.-based corporation that has
7,700 people and 13 refineries as well as 8,500 retail service
stations in more than 60 countries and areas in Asia, Africa and
the Middle East, affirmed that its corporate executive leadership
would be relocated to Singapore during the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development Board (EDB) of
Singapore, said, "Caltex will be the first multinational company
to establish its global corporate headquarters in Singapore" and
"EDB warmly welcomes Caltex to make Singapore its home."
</P>
<P>
The corporation, which is now based in Dallas, and will remain
registered in the U.S., said in a press release that the decision
to relocate came after reorganization of the company's worldwide
operations and extensive research into an optimal location for its
executive staff.
</P>
<P>
In June, Caltex extensively reorganized its operations to focus
primarily on specific lines of business rather than focus on a
geographic structure in response to a growing worldwide
deregulation of the markets for petroleum products, and enable the
company to improve operating efficiencies, focus its expertise,
and facilitate the sharing of knowledge across markets.
</P>
<P>
Caltex business units for trading, marketing, lubricants and
new business development will also be based in Singapore and its
new location will become operational by March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Development Priority in Human Rights Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending the
International Symposium on World Human Rights Towards the 21st
Century pointed out here today that the development of human
rights should conform to social progress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shunzhu, a researcher with the Beijing Society for
Comparative International Studies, said human rights is not
an isolated issue, but reflects every area of people's
material and spiritual lives, so "the progress of human rights
should be compatible with the level of social productive forces
and production relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of World War II in 1945, emphasis on human rights
has shifted to self-determination, development, peace, natural
sources, the environment, and humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The United States adopted the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights in 1948 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights 18 years later, which have served as major documents on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gerasimovich, Vice Foreign Minister of Belarus, called
the right of development the basis of human rights in accordance
with the current situation and prospect of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Only
when the development right is actually realized in the fields of
politics, economy, society and culture, can people live a wealthy,
healthy and hopeful life, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Shukong, member of the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, pointed out that it
is urgent to promote the realization of the right of development,
and that economic and social development compatible with national
situations is crucial to social stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
He urged that both developing and developed countries
contribute to global sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Hector Cuadra-Moreno, professor at the National University of
Mexico, said that what people need now is preferential
economic policies to improve their living conditions, the creation of more
jobs, and increasing investment in housing, hospitals, schools,
public traffic and social security.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhuqian, an official of the Commission of Legislative
Affairs of the National People's Congress Standing Committee,
stressed that promoting general development that centers on
a booming economy will eventually lead to human-rights progress.
</P>
<P>
China now is making great efforts to feed and clothe its
people in poverty-stricken areas with the aim of generally
improving people's lives, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Taliban to Sign Security Agreement Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
Afghanistan's Taliban are set to sign an agreement on security
arrangements for the U.N. personnel in Afghanistan, a senior
Taliban official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are stateside with the three-day talks, which will
also continue tomorrow (Thursday)," Taliban's representative
Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani told Xinhua here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that the two sides will ink the accord on
Friday," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the current talks would pave way for the
resumption of relief activities by the U.N. and international
non-governmental organizations in the war-torn Afghanistan," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on seven points of the 14-point
agenda and the rest would be discussed in the next round of
meeting, the Taliban official said.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's talks, the U.N. offered the security
sub-agreement which calls for official protection for the world
body's premises and also promises of its implementing partners and
mobile mission.
</P>
<P>
The said agreement also asks guarantee that if any U.N. staff
member is detained they should be released in 72 hours in absence
of formal charges against them, and the U.N. staff would be
allowed if they want to visit any of its detained staff.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's paramount leader Mulla Muhammad Omar in his last
week's meeting with U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in
Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, urged the world body and other aid
groups to resume their humanitarian operations in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies suspended their operations in
Taliban-controlled areas over a row on the relocation of their
offices by the Islamic movement in an old building on the
outskirts of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. withdrew its expatriate staff from Afghanistan in
August following the killing of an Italian national working for
the U.N. in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, whose shuttle diplomacy helped avert a possible war
between Iran and Taliban, also expressed the hope Monday that the
U.N. and other aid groups would return to Afghanistan following
security guarantees from the militia authorities.

<P>
SINGAPORE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Armed forces (SAF)
is staging an armored and live firing exercise at Shoalwater Bay
Training Area in Australia, the Ministry for Defense of Singapore
announced in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,200 personnel from the Armor and Guards battalions
are involved in the exercise, codenamed Exercise Wallaroo 98,
which lasts for 45 days from October 1, 1998 to November 14 1998.
</P>
<P>
Live firing exercise, Armor Battle Group maneuvers and
helicopter-borne training are listed on the agenda of the
exercise, the fourth in the Wallaroo series which started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A Super Puma helicopter detachment from the Republic of
Singapore Air Force, stationed at the Australian Army Aviation
Center in Oakey, is providing support to the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said exercises like Wallaroo allow the
SAF to conduct large-scale training in a realistic environment,
which it is unable to do in Singapore, given the shortage of land
and airspace.
</P>
<P>
The three services of the SAF often take part in exercises held
in overseas lands and waters to enhance their combat capability.

<HEADLINE> China's Eximbank Supports Foreign Trade Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- By the end of August, China's
Export and Import Bank (Eximbank) had ratified 616 supplier's
credit programs and six buyer's credit programs to support
exports of electronics and machinery products with a contracted
value of 17.25 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the Fourth Annual Meeting of Asian
Export Credit Agencies held today in Beijing, Vice-Governor of
Eximbank Gu Mingchao said that Eximbank has played a significant
role in China's foreign trade development and the country's
macroeconomic restructuring since its founding four years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, he said, the business volume of the
bank's export supplier's credit increased 13 times over that of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Gu said the bank has also expanded its export credit varieties
in recent years, which presently include project credit, medium-
and short-term quota credit, overseas engineering contract credit,
overseas facilities credit and overseas investment credit for
electronic and machinery products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Eximbank's export credit insurance and
foreign-oriented warranty business have also experienced rapid
development, with a sharp increase in volume.
</P>
<P>
He said this year the bank will further expand its client
base to include both state-owned large enterprises and
collectively owned enterprises, as well as shareholding
enterprises and small businesses.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Dialog Represents Trend for International Exchanges on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The two-day international
symposium on world human rights, the first event of its kind held
in China, closed today in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The symposium provided a excellent opportunity for officials
and scholars from China and 26 nations to have a free exchange of
views on human rights and proved that dialog is the only choice
for promoting the cause of international human rights.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the European Union (EU) announced that it
would not table proposals against China during the United Nations
Conference on Human Rights, and that it would engage in
constructive dialog with China rather than spark confrontation
concerning human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision isolated the United States which itself issued
a March announcement that it would not propose any motion against
China during the conference. The decision effectively ended the
farce of a small number of countries proposing motions against
China during successive conference since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders of Western nations, including France,
Germany and Italy, have voiced hope for settling their disputes
with China concerning human rights through dialog carried out on
the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Increasing calls for "dialog" in the international human right
arena fully demonstrates that trend for dialog to replace
confrontation has greatly enhance the worldwide human rights. At
the same time, attempts to use human rights as a weapon to
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries has had
little effect.
</P>
<P>
Human rights, a lofty goal of the mankind, should be valued by
every nation. However, at least for a certain period of time,
developed nations used human rights issues as a pretext for
attacking developing nations.
</P>
<P>
For example, the human right report issued early this year by
the U.S. State Department claimed that China has forced residents
to move from poverty-stricken mountain areas and has undermined
the traditional way of life of related ethnic groups. In fact,
resettling residents from adverse circumstances is part of the
Chinese government's effort to help them escape poverty and has
been warmly welcome by those involved.
</P>
<P>
The report which wantonly criticized human right situations in
194 countries and regions has been rejected by many countries in
Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the criteria for human rights is at least in principle
of universal significance, the focus and way each nation realizes
related goals vary due to significant differences in history,
culture, social systems and economic development.
</P>
<P>
A nation's choice of avenues for reaching goals represents a
basic human right in itself. However, the practise of commenting
on the situations in other countries on a biased basis, or
threatening to impose various sanctions under the pretext of human
rights, constitute violations of the basic precept.
</P>
<P>
Such practices neither promote the development of the
international human right cause, nor improve relations between
developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, only the government and people of a nation
are qualified to comment on human right conditions in their own
countries. The responsibility for protecting and promoting human
rights and fundamental freedom lies in the governments of
individual nations, according to comments Mary Robinson, high
commissioner of the UN Human Right Affair Office, made to the UN
Human Right Commission.
</P>
<P>
For example, the top priority of the Chinese government is to
provide its 1.2 billion people with adequate food and
clothing. Any other approach would represent a gross exaggeration
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has not only enjoyed political stability and rapid
economic growth, but has witnessed monumental improvements in
human rights over the past 20 years solely because it economic and
social policies suited to national conditions.
</P>
<P>
China has affixed its signature to 17 international human
rights documents, including the International Covenant for Civil
Rights and Political Rights signed earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the current international situation, peace and
development far outweigh the Cold War and are indeed the trend of
the times. Now is the time for certain politicians and
organizations in the United States and a few other countries to
change their thinking and do some practical things for the
promotion of international human rights.
</P>
<P>
Human rights situation in any country is far from perfect and
the promotion and protection of human rights represents a gradual
long-term. It is quite obvious that the choice of dialog instead
of confrontation will better serve the progress of the human right
cause worldwide.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Massive Housing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China expects to complete
construction of nearly 49 million square meters of affordable
housing this year by spending 41.9 billion yuan, as the demand for
housing continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye Rutang, vice minister of Construction, new
housing reform policies are being carried out nationwide and are
enjoying the full support of the people.
</P>
<P>
Under the new housing reform plan, China will cancel
welfare-based housing allocations step by step and promote
the commercialization of housing.
</P>
<P>
New and affordable housing will be sold to workers and staff
only, as ever more workers and staff will purchase their own
apartments by using housing subsidies, public housing funds and
bank loans, said the senior official.
</P>
<P>
In line with housing reform, commercial banks have begun to
provide mortgages for private housing purchases, and a public
housing fund-raising system has been instituted which is expected
to sharply stimulate housing purchases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide demand for housing keeps rising, the
vice-minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
To increase the average per capita urban living space to 9
square meters by the end of the century, the country must build
175 million square meters of affordable housing each year, and
renovate or rebuild 200 million square meters of existing housing
annually.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, housing reform is meant to bring
a rational and stable development to the real estate sector, which
now consists mainly of affordable housing projects.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Malaysia Not to Bow to West Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday that the West wants Asian
countries to open up everything, but Malaysia is not prepared to
bow to their demands.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the West had constantly branded Asian countries
as crony capitalists when their governments closed their doors to
foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
"What the West wants from Asian countries is to open up
everything to foreigners on grounds that their (Western) companies
are the most efficient ones. They suggested that if we don't open
up to them, it is crony capitalism," Mahathir told a news
conference here Wednesday evening on his just-concluded five-day
working visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that in most Asian countries, restrictions had been
imposed on foreign participation, particularly from the West.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia's case, Mahathir said, the government preferred to
provide opportunities to its own people through privatization, a
move which was not favored by the West.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We don't want our companies to be taken over, that is
why we did not accept the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid
because one of the Fund's conditions is to open up the economy by
100 percent."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is not prepared to bow to their demands, Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he believed the West would push its cause through
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Japan itself did not want to see Americans taking
over companies and in fact, Japan's restrictions are more tighter
than Malaysia's.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia's views on managing its economy were
gaining acceptance. Even U.S. billionaire financier and currency
speculator George Soros himself had accepted Malaysia's stand on
limits to financial speculation and was supportive of measures
introduced by Malaysia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said many parties, who had earlier blamed Asian
governments for the regional crisis, were now condemning currency
traders.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Taliban to Sign Security Agreement Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
Afghanistan's Taliban are set to sign an agreement on security
arrangements for the U.N. personnel in Afghanistan, a senior
Taliban official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are satisfied with the three-day talks, which will
also continue tomorrow (Thursday)," Taliban's representative
Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani told Xinhua here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that the two sides will ink the accord on
Friday," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the current talks would pave way for the
resumption of relief activities by the U.N. and international
non-governmental organizations in the war-torn Afghanistan," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on seven points of the 14-point
agenda and the rest would be discussed in the next round of
meeting, the Taliban official said.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's talks, the U.N. offered the security
sub-agreement which calls for official protection for the world
body's premises and also promises of its implementing partners and
mobile mission.
</P>
<P>
The said agreement also asks guarantee that if any U.N. staff
member is detained they should be released in 72 hours in absence
of formal charges against them, and the U.N. staff would be
allowed if they want to visit any of its detained staff.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's paramount leader Mulla Muhammad Omar in his last
week's meeting with U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in
Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, urged the world body and other aid
groups to resume their humanitarian operations in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies suspended their operations in
Taliban-controlled areas over a row on the relocation of their
offices by the Islamic movement in an old building on the
outskirts of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. withdrew its expatriate staff from Afghanistan in
August following the killing of an Italian national working for
the U.N. in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, whose shuttle diplomacy helped avert a possible war
between Iran and Taliban, also expressed the hope Monday that the
U.N. and other aid groups would return to Afghanistan following
security guarantees from the militia authorities.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Former Kia Boss Sentenced to Seven Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The former boss of South Korean
Kia Group, Kim Sun-hong, was sentenced to seven years in prison
Wednesday for embezzling company funds and guaranteeing debts for
insolvent subsidiaries, which led to the group's bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who headed Kia until last October, was convicted of
illegally ordering the group's flagship, Kia Motors, to lend 1.1
trillion won (some 1.1 billion U.S. dollars at the time) to four
troubled subsidiaries and guarantee 2.8 trillion won (2.8 billion
dollars) in debts incurred by them.
</P>
<P>
Along with Kim, four former Kia executives were given prison
terms ranging from 3 years to 3.5 years for their involvement in
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kim, once called South Korea's "Lee Iacocca" since he made Kia
Motors the nation's second largest auto company, was also found
guilty of diverting some 52.3 billion won (52.3 million dollars)
of company funds to a dubious in-house committee in an attempt to
keep control of Kia.
</P>
<P>
Kim and the other four were also found guilty of creating
enormous financial burdens for the group, deceiving shareholders
and weakening financial institutes.
</P>
<P>
Kia went bankrupt with 11.7 trillion won (11.7 billion dollars)
of debts in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conviction came two days after Kia Motors and its sister
company Asia Motors were sold at auction to Hyundai Motor Co.,
South Korea's top carmaker.
</P>
<P>
Kia's collapse, coupled with the failure of other large groups
in South Korea and Asia's financial crisis, brought the country
into a foreign exchange crisis and forced Seoul in December to ask
for a bailout loan of 57 billion dollars from the International
Monetary Fund.

MACAO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- With the latest Macao publicity
week being inaugurated Tuesday in China's northwestern city of
Xi'an, people in the inland areas of China are becoming more
acquainted with Macao which will return to the motherland in
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
and Ho Hau Wah, chairman of the executive council of the Macao
Basic Law Promotion Association, were present at the inauguration
ceremony Tuesday morning together with Shaanxi provincial
officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, such publicity weeks were held in Beijing, Nanjing
and Fuzhou cities in May, July and August, respectively. The
publicity activities attracted the attention of high-level local
officials and people from all walks of life. It is estimated that
a total of 100,000 people participated in the activities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, news media in the inland areas and those from Hong
Kong and Macao made wide coverage of the publicity weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to sponsors of the publicity weeks, such activities
enabled people in the mainland areas to know more about Macao's
history and the current situation here, and the process and
significance of Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of Macao's specialists touring together
the activities said they acquired more knowledge about the

provided by the Macao Postal and Telecommunications Department,
which depict Macao's unique culture and tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 kinds of books on display also show the booming
publishing business in Macao. In east China's Nanjing city, it is
said, two book specialists pored over the books for an entire
afternoon and said that they had not expected such high-quality
books and so many scholars in Macao are engaged in cultural and
academic studies.
</P>
<P>
The publicity activities are sponsored by the Xinhua News
Agency Macao Branch, the Macao Basic Law Promotion Association,
Macao Daily News, the Macao Association of Chinese Enterprises and
local publicity departments in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the sponsors said that many provinces and
municipalities including Anhui, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guangdong and
Shanghai, are vying for a Macao publicity week there.

Xie said each country has its own historical traditions,
cultural backgrounds and social systems, different levels of
development and values. However, it is due to diversification that
the understanding of things by the human race can be enriched and
deepened.

The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the
promotion and protection of human rights should be realized
through international cooperation, according to Xie.

also an important factor for promoting the cause. Dialog must be
based on equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 papers were presented during the
symposium. Scholars and experts from China and five continents
made enthusiastic speeches to reaffirm the historic position and
role of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the cause for
human rights development. They also reviewed the path traveled
thus far and the major achievements in the human rights cause over
the past half century, reflected on the remaining problems and
challenges, looked ahead to human rights in the 21st century, and
expressed their common determination to promote human rights
around the globe.
</P>
<P>

issues and expressed their belief that rights to subsistence and
development, as well as the social, economic and cultural and
political rights of citizens are of equal importance.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that developing and developed countries will
be required to make their due contributions to the ensuring of

By the end of September, most of the CCB's promised loans to

<HEADLINE> "Resource Indonesia 1998" Exhibition Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Wednesday urged thousands of Indonesian and foreign
businessmen participating as suppliers and buyers in an
international trade exhibition to make a win-win cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I hope, and I am sure, that we could make a win-win
cooperation here," the president said while opening the five-day
exhibition "Resource Indonesia 1998" in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said this year's "Resource Indonesia" is special to the
crisis-hit country because the number of its participants has
reached 825 for Indonesian suppliers and 3,500 for foreign buyers
coming from 76 countries.
</P>
<P>
"I was told that the number of participants is more than
expected. This reflects that confidence in this nation is
returning," he said.
</P>
<P>
This return of international confidence in Indonesia could also
be seen from the strengthening of the rupiah's value against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said he took note of reports Wednesday morning that the
rupiah was trading at 7,050 to the greenback, appreciating by
about 40 percent since July.
</P>
<P>
The president further noted that inflation rate by the end of
this month is expected to reach minus 0.75 percent, much lower
than September's 3.7 percent or July's 18.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This has helped reduce the prices of such basic commodities as
rice and cooking oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Habibie reminded the people to continue working hard
to end the country's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
"We should never feel pessimistic in finding a way out of this
crisis. We need to improve the competitiveness of our export
products," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai to Revive 2 Bankrupt Automakers with Big Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Hyundai Motor, the largest
automaker in South Korea, will have to inject 7.6 trillion won
(about 5.8 billion U.S. dollars) in two ailing automakers for
their revival, South Korean creditor banks said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bankrupt Kia Motors Co. and Asia Motors Co. were taken over
by Hyundai at an auction on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Creditor banks said Hyundai will have to buy 153 million shares of
Kia and 61.2 million shares of Asia in accordance with the bidding
terms under which Hyundai must keep 51 percent shares of the
two firms.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai Motor said it plans to seek capital injection from
foreign automakers and investors in a consortium to share the
financial burden.
</P>
<P>
Although Kia and Asia have owed an estimated 12.8 trillion won
(about 9.7 billion dollars) to financial institutions, Hyundai
will still shoulder a relatively small burden for the time being
as it has a seven-year period to repay the debt, analysts here
said.

</P>
<P>
Liu made the remark during a symposium on the theory and
practice of the Law on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan

Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 staffers from central and provincial Taiwan

</P>
<P>
Liu said the goal of the symposium is further perfect the
theory on the aforementioned law, improve legal environment for

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Steady in Quiet Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
steady Wednesday in quiet trading, as the market kept an eye on
the fortunes of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment it's really stuck in a range, tracking the yen,"
said Clifford Bennett, senior strategist at BNP.
</P>
<P>
The local currency could likely fall below 60.00 U.S. cents,
Bennett said, predicting a recovery in the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"I think the U.S. dollar has bottomed, and so given that we
have a bullish U.S. dollar view, the Aussie is sitting here for
the moment looking to roll over at any time."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended local trade unchanged at 63.20 U.S.
cents, after spending the day between 62.81 and 63.53 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Bennett said there was little justification for a strong
Australian dollar considering the current financial turmoil
affecting the commodity-based currency's key markets.
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be up here in the first place," he said. "We are
starting to lose our price competitiveness that was offsetting the
decline in commodities for the last two years."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 73.41 Japanese yen from 72.84
Tuesday and 1.0341 German marks from 1.0329.

China, presided over the closing session, call the symposium a
complete success.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- More rivers in Malaysia
became polluted with the number of polluted rivers almost doubled
in 1997 compared to 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual Environmental Quality Report 1997
released here Wednesday, there were 25 polluted rivers last year
compared to 13 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by the Department of Environment showed
that the number of clean rivers had decreased from 42 in 1996 to
24 in 1997, while rivers slightly polluted had increased from 61
in 1996 to 68 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that sources of river pollution were from
agrobased industries, livestock farms, sewage and manufacturing
activities.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment also conducted ground water
quality monitoring and preliminary findings based on samples
analyzed did not show any significant contaminant in ground water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 8.5 million registered vehicles in Malaysia
unleashed 1.9 million tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere
last year, making it a major source of air pollution in urban
centers, according to the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Petrol Fire Victims Flee Hospital in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of the victims of
Saturday's pipeline fire in southern Nigeria have fled hospitals
for fear of being arrested and charged for their role in the
disaster that have been described by government as act of
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing this to newsmen in his office at the
government-owned Central Hospital in Sapele town, where most of
the victims were hospitalized, doctor Hostings Eduvie said there
was a rumor circulating in the area that government plans to
arrest and charge those hospitalized for sabotage, media reports
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Eduvie, who is the medical director of the
hospital, said most of them have voluntarily discharged
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The doctor debunked the claim in some quarters that victims
were forced to leave the hospital because there were no equipment
and drugs to treat them.
</P>
<P>
According to him, oil companies such as Chevron, Shell and
other organizations have sent drugs needed by fire victims.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at the fire site in Jesse town, near Warri
City, the chairman of the Red Cross Society, Warri Division,
Tenison Unavwobo said his team had recovered over 200 corpses
from River Ethiope and surrounding bushes between Monday and
Tuesday. He said the searchinG would continue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
has been ordered to start investigations into the accident, which
the company said was caused by saboteurs who cut the pipeline to
steal petrol\ according to Nigerian leader, General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, who was addressing state house reporters Tuesday in
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking to reporters Tuesday at Jesse, NNPC's Executive
Director J.T. Ogungbemi said that more fire fighters would be
brought to the site to distinguish the petrol fire that is still
burning on.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people were burnt to death at the weekend in a
ferocious fire from burst oil pipeline in Jesse town near Warri
City.

<HEADLINE> Transport Links to Mainland Vital to HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Special
Administrative Region (SAR) official said Wednesday that
linkage with the mainland is a key element in drawing up Hong
Kong's long-term transport blueprint.
</P>
<P>
"One key element in our long-term strategic transport planning
is to look beyond the boundary of Hong Kong," said Anson Chan, the
 SAR's Administrative Secretary, in a keynote speech at the
Asia-Pacific Public Transport congress that opened here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the SAR government has decided to build
a spur line leading to a second rail passenger boundary crossing
in order to meet projected increase in the cross boundary flow of
people and goods.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's economy is becoming increasingly integrated
with the mainland, the daily number of cross boundary vehicles now
has reached 28,000 and is still growing at a rate of six percent
every year. Some 200,000 people cross the border every day,
accounting for three percent of Hong Kong's total population.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the SAR government is discussing with the
relevant mainland authorities the possibility of opening new
boundary road crossings to Shenzhen and Zhuhai, two mainland
cities adjoining or near Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the International Union of Public Transport (UIPT)
 for the first time in the Asia-Pacific region, the conference
provides a forum for the exchange of views, sharing of experience,
and tapping of solutions to common problems in urban
transport. Hundreds of delegates from 25 countries take part in
the three-day congress.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Banks Purchase Small Foreign Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks have not been
able to buy large amounts of U.S. dollars despite the prime
minister's decision to force companies to sell at least 80 percent
of their foreign exchange earnings, the Saigon Times daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh City Branch of the Central Bank said since the
prime minister's decision took effect, banks have bought around 95
million U.S. dollars, with the City Branch of the Bank for Foreign
Trade of Vietnam accounting for 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a latest report sent to the state bank governor, the English
-language daily said, the branch pointed out problems that have
impeded banks' foreign currency purchases and requested the
Central Bank to immediately take action to deal with these.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested firms without foreign exchange guarantees will
not be forced to sell foreign funds in their bank accounts, but
they have yet to know what state agencies are responsible for
proving that they are not subject to the decision, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it said, public notary offices do not agree to
notarize the copies of contracts written in English, so foreign
companies cannot show sufficient documents to banks in cases where
they are not to sell their foreign exchange holdings.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Saigon Times daily said, it often takes an
applicant a long time to have a document certified.

<HEADLINE> Urban Transport Congress Opened in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An Asian-Pacific congress on
public transport opened here Wednesday to provide a venue for
hundreds of delegates from around the world to share their
insights into promoting the development of efficient urban
transport.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was chosen to host the regional congress because the
city is an international model for public transport development,
according to the organizer, International Union (Association) of
Public Transport (UITP).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Anson Chan, Secretary of
Administration of the Special Administrative Region (SAR), briefed
the participants on Hong Kong's urban transport system.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now boasts a comprehensive, efficient and affordable
urban transport network, ranging from trains to ferries, buses and
trams. Government statistics show that Hong Kong's five franchised
bus operators together carry four million passengers every day,
its suburban railways handles around one million passengers and
its underground railway moves over 2.3 million population a day.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul Bailly, president of UITP, highlighted the
preponderance of city transport in his opening remarks, saying:
"Urban transit is part of billions of people's daily lives, so it
plays a key part in society. Its economic role is equally
essential."
</P>
<P>
But he noted: "Mass transit is not an end itself. Its ultimate
purpose is shaped by the city, and its long-standing partner in
working to serve city-dwellers."
</P>
<P>
The UITP president enumerated four challenges for mass transit
in tomorrow's cities -- how to build an accessible city with
tailored networks and transit models, create a pleasant urban
environment, improve service quality and at the same time achieve
economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Hans Rat, Secretary General of UITP, said here Wednesday: "Asia
is the world's largest continent, which has a population of three
billion and covers one third of the global land mass. Keeping such
a densely populated and fast-growing region on the move is a
constant challenge for public transport operators. That is why
UITP organized its first Asia-Pacific Congress in Hong Kong this
year."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1885, UITP is a worldwide association of urban and
regional transport operators and authorities, with 1,700 members
scattered in some 80 countries and regions in the globe. Its chief
objective is to promote the development of more efficient and
attractive public transport services.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the three-day conference, the Asia-Pacific City
Transport Exhibition 1998 is held in Hong Kong. Some 80 public
transport operators, automobile manufacturers, and transport
authorities from all over the world display their latest product
designs and technologies there.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Malaysia to Resume Defense Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled defense
cooperation talks between Malaysia and the Philippines will push
through in Manila next month, Philippine presidential spokesman
Jerry Barican said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing information from the Malaysian Defense Ministry, he said
the bilateral defense cooperation meeting, originally set for
October 28-30, will take place in Manila on November 8-10.
</P>
<P>
He added that the deferment of the meeting by Malaysia on
October 19 was due to "financial and scheduling constraints" and
has nothing to do with the incident of former Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested more than two weeks ago and would soon be
tried in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has called for "the respect
of human rights and due process" for Anwar's trial. However, he
denied that he interfered in Malaysia's internal affairs, saying
what he expressed was only his "personal opinion."
</P>
<P>
There were news reports that Malaysia deferred the scheduled
meeting to show its anger at Estrada's support for Anwar.
</P>
<P>
"The President and Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado have been
apprised of this development. They have also been informed that
the earlier cancellation of the meeting was not in any way related
to the Anwar Ibrahim incident but to financial and scheduling
constraints," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Philippine Defense Department has started
preparations for the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Bumper Corn Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China anticipates a bumper corn
harvest for this year, with pig production expected to fall and
the decline in corn prices expected to continue, according to
today's issue of Market Daily.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates for the year indicate that corn was planted
on 23.72 million ha, up 2.15 percent on the 1997 figure. Corn
output is expected to hit 115.55 million tons, up 10.8 percent on
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates the projections fully consider the impact
of heavy summer flooding which hit many parts of China between
June and September. The report also points that flooding affected
beans much more than corn.
</P>
<P>
The increased corn output will further dash hopes for a rise in
corn prices which have been on a downward spiral since the end of
last year, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Daily pointed out that many piggeries have expanded
butchering or are selling pigs prematurely and that related
actions will decrease the demand for corn.
</P>
<P>
The paper forecasted further drops in corn prices in the
foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crisis Could Hurt Environment: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A worrisome by-product of the
ongoing economic crisis in Asia could be environmental degradation
as a result of shifting priorities in government policies, Kayuko
Mizuta, deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the low growth figures projected by the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund for Asian output growth in 1998 do
not take into account any environmental considerations and costs,"
Mizuta said at a three-day meeting on environment and natural
resources, which was inaugurated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mizuta said the climatic anomalies and natural disasters in
several parts of Asia during the past year had worsened the
economic and social conditions and were related to environmental
degradation caused by human action.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first session of the Committee on
Environment and Natural Resources Development, established by
ESCAP in 1997 as part of a revamped program designed to increase
the responsiveness of the regional body to the environmental
challenges facing countries in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Sunthad Somchevita, representative of the Thai Ministry of
Science, Technology and Environment, said that despite the
economic crisis Thailand had not relaxed its determination to
achieve clean and green environment.
</P>
<P>
Policy measures and enforcement mechanism are being actively
pursued to achieve this objective, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 delegates from various ESCAP member countries, United
Nations agencies, intergovernmental and non-government
organizations are attending the meeting which will end on October
23.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Great Progress in Human Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
stated today that the Chinese government and people have made
unremitting efforts to realise the objective of fully enjoying
human rights and have achieved world-renowned progress.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the International Symposium
on World Human Rights Towards 21st Century, State Council
Information Office Director Zhao Qizheng said that the symposium
is a rare opportunity for the Chinese people and the people of
other countries to learn from each other and promote mutual
understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government fully supports the event which was
sponsored by the China Society for Human Rights Studies and the
United Nations Association of China, noted Zhao.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people have profoundly changed their
destiny during the 20th century. For about 100 years, due to its
poverty and backwardness, China was forced to face hundreds of
wars of aggression and to sign more than 1,000 unequal
treaties. Consequently China's wealth was looted and the lives
and dignity of the Chinese people were subject to appalling
devastation
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China put an end to
the history of oppression and humiliation and the Chinese people
won rudimentary respect and rights as human beings, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, especially the initiation of
reform and opening up to the outside world, the Chinese government
has combined the universal principles of human rights with the
country's actual conditions and persisted in putting the rights to
subsistence and development first and strengthened the building of
democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>
"The endeavors have pushed forward human rights in an all-round
way and have profoundly changed China's social features," Zhao
stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Great Progress in Human Rights (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within a short period of 20 years, the number of China's
poverty-stricken people has been reduced by over 200 million and
the majority of people now have enough food and clothing and are
making steady progress towards a well-off life.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has also been made in the development of
democracy which has greatly improved people's awareness of
exercising and enjoying civil and political rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhao went on to say that in the struggle against the worst
floods in decades this summer, the Chinese government did
everything possible to protect some 200 million people in the
flood-stricken areas and ensure that they have food, clean
drinking water, shelter and medical treatment and that the
children in these areas attend schools.
</P>
<P>
The government efforts have helped to reduce to the minimum the
losses of people's lives and property in the floods, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Zhao admitted that China's human rights situation is far from
perfect. Restricted by its natural and historical conditions and
economic development level, it has a long way to go before
realizing modernization and ensure its people fully enjoy human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
emphasized that the Party would strive to respect and guarantee
human rights and included governing the country according to law
and guarantee human rights in China's cross-century development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"All these have opened up wide prospects for the development of
China's human rights program into the next century," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that for many years other countries have known little
about China's human rights situation, leading to much
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
Zhao criticized some western people for "judging human rights
issues politically and ideologically" and "regarding a certain
social system as the embodiment of human rights and considering
other social systems and development modes as expressions of
infringement upon human rights."
</P>
<P>
He concluded his speech by pledging that China is sparing no
efforts to build itself into a prosperous, democratic and
culturally advanced country and calling for "maximum understanding
and support" from countries across the world.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Nationalize Mineral Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHQNNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government intends to nationalize South Africa's unexploited
mineral rights in the next 20 years to give black companies
greater access to them, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, current mining operations and bona fide intended
operations would be allowed to continue and would not be tampered
with by government, said Minerals and Energy Minister Penuell
Maduna, who released a mining policy white paper and draft
legislation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said it was unacceptable to the government that
two-thirds of private ownership of mineral rights was in hands of
the white. But he added that the new policy would not effect
security of tenure for existing mining operations.
</P>
<P>
"The state is not in the mining business. Our intervention is
not aimed at keeping mineral rights in our pockets, but to make
them available and to open up opportunities for all people."
</P>
<P>
The government's long-term objective was for all mineral
rights to vest in the state, but as a transitional measure, a new
system for granting access to mineral rights would apply.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said the white paper mentioned no specific transition
period, but he expected it to be about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The new system's main aspect would be that the right to
prospect for and to mine all minerals would vest in the state
without infringing on the rights of existing mining right
holders.
</P>
<P>
"The holder of a prospecting right will be entitled to
progress to a mining right on compliance with prescribed criteria
and commitments."
</P>
<P>
During the transitional per)od, holders of mining and mineral
rights would be allowed to register existing or intended
operations under the new system.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said all prospecting information would be submitted to
the state after the completion or abandonment of a particular
prospecting activity.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the prospector retains a mining right, the information
will be released to the public. The freeing of mineral rights
will facilitate greater investment in the mineral industry, also
by small-scale miners."
</P>
<P>
Maduna said mining on a limited scale could increase
competitiveness and help to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investment in the mining sector would also be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Legislation to put the new policy into effect would be
introduced after next year's general election, Maduna said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Firm Aims at No.1 Internet Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's leading
cellular network operator Vodacom Tuesday launched its
53-million-U.S. Dollar Internet service, which allowc Internet
access through prepaid vouchers.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom, one of South Africa's two dominating cellular network
providers, said it planned to be the country's largest Internet
service provider in just two months, Business Day rfported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But becoming a significant player by Christmas is a tall
order, considering the 150 registered Internet service providers
and an estimated 750,000 Internet users in the country, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive deadline gives Vodacom 10 weeks to outsell
South Africa's largest access providers, UUNet Internet Africa,
with 80,000 dial-up users, and MWeb, with 58,000 dial-up clients.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom said it was not worried by the cenge, as it did
not see a very competitive market in the Internet field.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom chief executive officer Alan Knott-Craig said there
were still about 4.3 million users to be signed up for Internet
access across the coubtry, and Vodacom's newly-launched Yebonet
wanted the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom will offer prepaid Internet access using its cellular
phone vouchers, which were already available from retail outlets
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Voda#om said Yebonet would target consumers aged between 16
and 25 and the main source of news on the website was from South
Africa's leading newspaper group, the Independent Group.
</P>
<P>
However, some of South Africa's major Internet service
providers said Vodacom was being extremely optimistic. They
doubted a new player like Vodacom would dominate the market in a
few months, as the subscriber base was pretty well entrenched.

<HEADLINE> Risky Investment: A New Way To Use Chinese Research Findings (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xu Xingtang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Risky investments have been a
popular topic among Chinese financiers for the past few months as
a new way to raise scientific and technological development funds
that can greatly help make commercial use of research findings.
</P>
<P>
These investments use money for research and development of
technology and products that contain a high degree of risk but
that have a high rate of return.
</P>
<P>
In March, when the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) met in Beijing, a
proposal for a risky investment mechanism was a major bill set
before the conference, one that caught the immediate attention of
both government and society.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, Prof. Cheng Siwei, has been studying risky
investments for many years and says that they have good prospects
in China and that the time is ripe for them.
</P>
<P>
He says that they are an effective method of supporting
research commercialization and can help the development of new
industries and provide new use of public capital to benefit
national economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
Every year China has more than 10,000 new research findings and
over 20,000 patents, but fewer than 10 percent can be put to
practical use and the others withered away because of lack of
funds or for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening up and reforms started some 20 years ago,
high-tech industries have made big strides and there are 52
state-level high-tech development zones and approximately 20,000
high-tech enterprises across the country, providing a good
environment for developing research results. When adequate
investment is available, it can generate good returns.
</P>
<P>
The amount of bank deposits in the country has been more than 5
trillion yuan for a long time, and once a well-regulated risky
investment mechanism is established, these funds can be channeled
into the technology sector to develop emerging enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid special attention to high-tech
industries and has a series of policies and measures that guide
investment into them. Since 1984, banks have played a major role
in providing science and technology loans that have gone from some
15 million yuan at that time to more than 8 billion yuan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A large number of risky investment companies have emerged and
there are more than 80 science and technology trust companies,
risky investment companies, and related credit cooperatives with a
combined investment portfolio of 3 billion yuan.

<P>
But, analysts say, this is not a risk capital industry because
the investment still uses traditional investment methods of
government capital allocation, and funds follow government
policies. In nature it is still government investment, and the
government undertakes the investment risks as well.
</P>
<P>
They say that China has appropriate conditions for funds,
technology, and personnel to develop risky investment and that
what the government should do is to accelerate financial system
reforms and encourage risky investment.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhaoming, of Jiangsu Securities, says that a government
mechanism is needed to develop the business and should include
government subsidies, bank loans with government warranties, and
preferential tax measures.
</P>
<P>
A prominent economist from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, Wang Guogang, says that China should build a multi-tier
capital market to promote risky investment and an ideal way is to
set up a second securities market to serve emerging enterprises
that can provide fund-raising channels for privately-run,
high-tech enterprises that have difficulties qualifying for the
A-shares market.
</P>
<P>
Cheng says China's risky investment business is still at a
primary stage and that all conditions must be taken into full
account when designing an investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
He proposes first, setting up risky investment advisory and
management companies responsible for appraising projects and
recommending them to investors; secondly, establishing risky
investment funds within 3 to 5 years to raise funds from domestic
and overseas sources and, thirdly, opening the second security
market within 5 to 10 years.

</P>
<P>
Professor Tay said the trend towards globalization has made us
neighbors subject to mutual fate. We must cooperate in saving
lives, alleviating suffering, protecting values and sustaining
faith. Modern technology allows us to respond far more quickly to
human rights concerns. Television images of battlefield smoke
should always remind us the urgent need to act.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the 21st century, Professor Tay said that the
lingering crisis has led to the emergence of new challenges. War,
famine and loss of educational opportunities continue to be major
problems and the most vulnerable social groups need a helping hand
to protect their rights. Accepting the responsibilities of
"neighborhoods" in regional formations will be a key factor in
tackling human rights problems. Relief and assistance for basic
needs must be met and technical assistance must be provided. The
rule of law and the role of government must be
promoted. Neglecting human rights issues because of economic
setbacks is a highly risky issue.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The leaders and members of
local bodies in Sri Lanka's Jaffna city have appealed to the
international community to prevent the Tamil rebels from
disrupting the democratic functions in the north, according to
reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A letter to the international community signed by the leaders
and members of all the 17 local bodies in Jaffna city had been
sent to the embassies and high commissions in Colombo and other
foreign non-governmental organizations, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the letter which was delivered Tuesday called
for the immediate involvement of the international community in

<HEADLINE> Japan Committed to Close Ties with S. Africa: Mbeki Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan has pledged to keep
its economic and development relationship with South Africa
despite his country's financial stisis, local daily Business Day
quoted Deputy President Thabo Mbiek as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who is visiting Japan, Tuesday told a press conference
in Tokyo after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
that the Japanese government was committed to helping Africa and
enhancing bilateral ties with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is attending the 2nd Tokyo International Conference on
African Development (Ticad II) in the Japanese capital. He
visited Japan in April this year when Obuchi was still foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had proposed that South Africa and Japan should meet as
soon as possible to discuss the practical implementation of an
agenda for action which wi|l be adopted at the ongoing Ticad.
</P>
<P>
The agenda aims to halve the number of Africa's extremely poor
country by 2015.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki dismissed perceptions that Ticad II was yet another
talkshop, saying that Japan, one of the largest economic power in
the world, was so focused on Africa that could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Japan, along with the United Nations and the Global Coalition
for Africa, is sponsoring Ticad II, a follow-up to the first
conference held in Tokyo in 1993 in which South Africa only
participated as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also welcomed Obuchi's statement on Monday that Japan
was giving serious consideration to increasing its debt relief
program. He described this as a "very welcome flexibility"
because Japan had historically been more orthodox in its
approach to debt relief.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, African debt stands at about 170
billion U.S. Dollars, of which 45 billion Dollars is owed to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Japan's new attitude would have important implications for
calls for debt relief, as the country had an important voice in
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Media Say Peace Deal is Expected Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli news media said on
Wednesday that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, who are
holding talks at the seclusive Wye Plantation outside Washington,
will reach a peace deal soon.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted a senior member of the
Israeli delegation as saying that the bargaining is "gruesome,"
but "there is a good chance we will clinch a deal at the last
minute."
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz said sources from all three sides
concurred that after five days of deadlock, the mood turned
upbeat on Tuesday and an agreement might be finalized on
Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A report by Israel Television Channel 1 said that a signing
ceremony is also planned for Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz added that one important area of progress is in the
realm of security, where sources said there is convergence on
areas of principle, although some drafting remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
And Israel is now apparently prepared to accept a Palestinian
counter-terrorism "work plan" put forward by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiators also explored possible compromises with
Palestinian officials on establishing a safe passage between the
West Bank and Gaza, and constructing a Palestinian seaport in
Gaza, and there are signs that an accord has been reached on the
Dahaniya Airport.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of a unilateral Palestinian declaration of
statehood on May 4 next year, the U.S. is trying to defuse a
potential explosion by agreeing to discuss final status issues at
a later "event," on the eve of the May 4th deadline, to replace it.
</P>
<P>
But disagreements still remain on several issues, including
the third Israeli pullback, a "time-out" for Jewish settlement
expansion and the Israeli insistence on convening the Palestinian
National Council to delete the call for Israel's destruction in
the 1964 Palestinian Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post said that Israel has offered a "partial
agreement" that would leave out the most contentious points, such
as the extent and timing of the third withdrawal. But the
Palestinians are insisting on a full agreement, saying they must
get commitments now.
</P>
<P>
The Yediot Aharonot newspaper noted that Jordan's King Hussein
arrived at the Wye Plantation on Tuesday and his joining the
mediation efforts would give an extra boost to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Plantation summit began last Thursday and was extended
twice with no sign of progress until Tuesday. The Israeli and
Palestinian leaders will continue talks on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> The World Has No Choice But to Act (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- "Cries of distress leave no
choice but to act," according to Alice Tay, president of the
Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
Tay made the comment today at the International Symposium on
World Human Rights Towards the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tay said that opportunities for rebuilding societies
and communities suffering from destruction and loss are just as
great today as they were 50 years ago when the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights was signed. Opportunities are
accompanied by various crises such as localized wars, and the
revival of racial, religious and ideological conflicts which have
brought continuing misery to the world. However, significant
differences between today and 50 years ago include the fact that
many more nations, organizations and individuals have joined
together to build better societies.
</P>
<P>
Tay addressed China's human rights record by noting that the
ideals of human rights are not only self-evident, but also serve
the mutual purpose of all nations. However, pluralized social and
historical backgrounds determine different starting point for
human rights record. Therefore, we should focus more on
aspirations, rather than achievements when evaluating human rights
records. China has a long history of feudalism and wartime
turbulence and quite naturally shoulders imperative responsibility
in this respect. The fact that China recently signed a number of
human rights conventions represents the nation's desire to keep
its sincere promise to the world.

<HEADLINE> Develop Southern Chinese Province as Ecology Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan
has followed a road of coordinating economic development with
environmental protection in an attempt to become the country's
No.1 ecology center by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The province has been trying to develop environmentally-sound
agriculture, high-yield agriculture, tourism, and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
An industrial layout has been worked out to restrict pollution
in certain areas and environmental protection input has increased,
with infrastructure receiving the most financial support.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government says that by the year 2002, the
province's environmental protection will include forest coverage,
water quality, and air quality, and by 2000, the province will
become the first not to use fluorine in refrigeration, have
industrial pollution discharge standards, ban the use of leaded
gas, and increase the use of new energy instead of coal.

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Hope Government Helps Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Two thirds of Americans
believe that the U.S. government should help the poor, preferably
through education and job training rather than "income transfers,"
said a Gallup social survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 45 percent of respondents say the government should
tax the rich to help level the playing field.
</P>
<P>
The latest Gallup survey questioned 5,001 people from April 23
through May 21 and focused on the questions of American's "have"
and "have nots", in light of concerns that the country is growing
more divided between the rich and poor, said Frank Newport, editor
in chief of the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that almost two thirds feel that money and
wealth in the United States have not been evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
"What's clear in our data is that Americans appear to want some
reduction in the degree of economic inequality," said Jack Ludwig,
a Gallup senior scientist who ran the survey.

<HEADLINE> Israel Settlers Protest Against Wye Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli settlers were holding
protests in the West Bank Wednesday after hearing the news that an
agreement is to be reached soon in the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Jewish settlers gathered from Wednesday
morning near the settlement of Beit El, north of the West Bank
city of Ramallah, to curse the ongoing talks at Wye Plantation
outside Washington which reportedly would lead to Israel's further
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers have blocked the Ramallah-Nablus main
highway and set up road barriers on it, a local Palestinian
reporter told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace talks concluded its sixth day discussions
Tuesday. To help achieve a breakthrough, U.S. President Bill
Clinton canceled his fund-raising trip to California to join talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jordan, who was undergoing cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, was also called by
Clinton to come to the Plantation to contribute to the mediation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports said progress was made during Tuesday's
talks on several key issues, security in particularly, but they
remain divided on the third Israeli pullback, the expansion of
settlement, the scope of Palestinian prisoners' release and the
Israeli insistence on convening the Palestinian National Council
to delete the call for Israel's destruction in the 1964
Palestinian Charter.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the reports said, an agreement signing ceremony is
expected shortly, possibly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As the Wye Plantation peace talks moved on, Israeli settler
leaders held an "emergency meeting" Tuesday in Jerusalem and
decided to be prepared to block 15 key roads leading to the West
Bank and Gaza Strip the minute an agreement is initiated at Wye
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's demonstrations near Beit El were apparently part of
the protest activities organized by the settlers to vent their
anger over Netanyahu's possible concessions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 17 members of the right-wing Land of Israel Front of
the Knesset (parliament), have threatened that they will vote
against the government if Netanyahu retreats from his hardline
positions.

<HEADLINE> Experts on Human Rights Challenges in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Scholars attending the
International Symposium on World Human Rights Towards the 21st
Century in Beijing today agreed that it's going to take a great
effort to promote human rights and free human beings from wars and
turbulence in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the symposium, which is sponsored by the China
Society for Human Rights Studies and the China UN Association, is
to discuss developing human rights in the 21st century and to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Virendra Dayal, former Deputy Secretary-General of the United
Nations, said that protecting human rights means not only keeping
world peace and security, but also ensuring sustained development
globally and within all countries.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts must be made to establish complete relationship among
peace, development and rights, and to keep the efforts coherent
and reasonable, there must be impartial and just policies in all
fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the changing content of human rights along with the
deepening understanding of the rights, the former UN official said
that the world must make a greater effort to consolidate human
rights developments and to increase women's rights.
</P>
<P>
After two world wars, the United Nations Charter was adopted in
1945. Three years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
defined the relation between interior peace in one country and
human rights with legal protection.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Khalifa, a former chairman of the UN Social Development
Commission, said that human rights issues are now mixed up with
global conflicts in politics and ideology, and that one of the
most important things is to avoid social upheavals caused by the
increasing imbalance of social forces and marginalization.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zaibang, an international relations scholar, said that
poverty will remain a serious problem in the 21st century and the
existing international economic order is becoming an obstacle to
the development of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In international affairs, power politics and violation of human
rights in various forms will continue to present obstacles to the
effective protection of human rights in various countries, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Siew Nyoke Chow, a Malaysian scholar, expressed the opinions of
ASEAN member countries about the current human rights situation in
the world.
</P>
<P>
She said that for many Asian countries, the unfair and unequal
global structure controlled by some Western countries does much
more harm to the economic, social, cultural and political rights
of mankind than any single country does to human rights.

<HEADLINE> Discounts Attract American Online Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 Xinhua) -- Discounted pricing is the
most important way to make the American online shoppers become
online buyers, according to a study released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study found that those who have access to the Internet but
yet to make purchases online are still hesitant to initiate
transaction, citing price, not payment security, as a primary
concern.
</P>
<P>
They were less likely to make an initial purchase soon. One of
the main reasons for the reluctance is the barrier of price. Most
of them said that greater discounts online will spark buying
behavior, said the study, which was based on an extensive set of
consumer surveys.
</P>
<P>
The study was jointly conducted by Jupiter Communications, a
new media research firm, and NFO Worldwide, a provider of customer
and syndicated marketing information services.
</P>
<P>
A significant 35 percent of the 60 million U.S. online
population did purchase a product or service in the last year and
were satisfied with their shopping experience, the study said.
</P>
<P>
However, it went to say that although lowering prices may help
many transact online, it should not be the only outcome that
online marketers depend on. Consumers are increasingly relying on
online information sources to drive their off-line purchases.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- There was a good chance that a deal would be reached at the
last minute of the peace negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians at the Wye Plantation in the United States, a senior
member of Israeli delegation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A signing ceremony is reportedly planned for Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Hamas is unable to mount the kind of mass terror attack they
want to commit in Israel, said Amos Malcha, director of Military
Intelligence for the Israel Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Malcha told the Knesset's (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee Tuesday that the absence of major Hamas attack
in recent months "is not because the Hamas decided not to execute
a mass attack, but rather because they don't have the operational
ability."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian arrested for wounding 64 Israelis in
Monday's grenade attack has told investigators that he also
carried out another two attacks in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian security sources said Tuesday that
the suspect was a double agent who succeeded in foiling Israeli
General Security Service who recruited him.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyclist Valentino Fois of Italy
has been suspended until April 1, 1999, by the Court of
Arbitration of Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that a decision by a appeal panel of the
Italian Cycling Federation to treat two separate cases of doping
by Fois as a single case was not correct.
</P>
<P>
The court made the ruling after the international cycling body
UCI appealed in July in order to overturn the Italians' decision.
</P>
<P>
Fois was originally banned for only eight months from
September 30, 1997 but the UCI wanted him suspended for an
additional year.
</P>
<P>
Fois tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during
the 1997 Tours of Switzerland and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Profit Loss Brings America Bank President Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- David Coulter, president of
Bank of America, the largest in the United States, announced his
resignation Tuesday, following the bank's huge drop in the
third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was extremely difficult for me, both personally
and professionally," he said in a bank's news release, without
explaining why.
</P>
<P>
Hugh McColl, the bank's chairman and CEO, said in a brief
statement that "it is very painful for me personally to accept his
resignation."
</P>
<P>
On October 15, the bank reported a profit falling by half to
893 million U.S. dollars in the third quarter from 1.77 billion
dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sag in profits was the result in large part of the carnage
in the bank's worldwide trading of stocks, bonds and currencies
and losses in such troubled places as Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America is the result of a merger between NationsBank
and BankAmerica. Coulter was formerly chairman and CEO of
BankAmerica and expected to succeed the 63-year-old McColl as the
new bank's chairman. But a decision he made cost both his old and
future jobs.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Eradication Contributes to Human Rights Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Human rights experts attending
the ongoing International Symposium on World Human Rights Towards
the 21st Century said today that eradicating poverty represents the
most important human rights issue requiring immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li Tiecheng from the Beijing Languages and Culture
College pointed out that the "gap between the rich and poor is
widening, and the seriousness of social problems such as the
unequal distribution of resources is increasing.
</P>
<P>
No country, large or small, can separate itself from
population, environmental, economic, social and military issues

regional conflicts affect all parts of the world.

only need sympathy, but also actual work and action," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Park Sang-Yong, a member of the United Nations Subcommission on

<P>
He also suggested that the United Nations should properly
handle the relationship between protecting human rights and
respecting the sovereignty. "Human rights protection will mainly
rely on the efforts of sovereign states," according to Li.

</P>
<P>
Malaysia's export of shrimps was adversely affected by the U.S.
trade embargo which came into effect in May 1996, the ministry
said, adding since then Malaysia's exports of wild harvested
shrimps to the U.S. were significantly diminished as only aqua
cultured shrimps were imported from Malaysia last year while there
was no export of wild harvested shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's total shrimps export to the U.S. fell to 1.47
million U.S. dollars in 1997 from 9.1 million U.S. dollars in
1995, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> NZ Scientists Find Cause for Women Losing Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Scientists have
found "the real cause" for women who suffer multiple miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
Until now it is thought many fetuses die in the womb because
clots in the mother's blood supply block the flow of nutrients to
the unborn child. But a team of NZ scientists headed by Dr. Larry
Chamley, of Auckland University's Department of Obstetrics, has
discovered that women who suffer repeated miscarriages or
stillborn babies produce a particular antibody, called
anticardiolipin, which interferes with the growth of vital cells
in the placenta called trophoblasts, the New Zealand Press
Association (NZPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the team, these cells effectively kickstart
placental growth by invading the arteries of the uterus and
increasing bloodflow to the placenta so the baby can grow. But the
anticardiolipin antibody interferes with the placenta's formation,
destroying the baby's chances of survival to full term.
</P>
<P>
The team's discovery also questioned the effectiveness of
existing treatments where anticoagulants are given to at-risk
women to prevent blood clots forming, the NZPA said.
</P>
<P>
"We produced antibodies in the laboratory which mimic these
women's antibodies and we then put them with trophoblast cell
lines," Dr. Chamley said. "We showed they actually stopped the
trophoblast cells from growing, which means they can't form the
placenta. They effectively prevent the pregnancy from working."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chamley's team hopes the discovery can lead to the
development of new drugs which can spare women the heartbreak of
repeated miscarriages, the NZPA said.

<HEADLINE> California Wildfires Blaze out of Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Wildfires, pushed by strong
winds, Tuesday continued to rage out of control in several areas
throughout California, local news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fire in Fillmore, Ventura County, about 112 kilometers
north of Los Angeles, has consumed 6,500 acres of brush and trees
in mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
"The fire was 55 percent contained and should be surrounded by
Friday night, said Ventura Country fire Capt. Michael Lindbery,
adding that more than 900 firefighters are keeping the biggest of
the blazes away from homes.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 kilometers further north, a 3,300-acre blaze in dense
brush in the remote Los Padres National Forest, also in Ventura
Country, was 40 percent contained. Reports said more than 1,100
firefighters are battling fire there.
</P>
<P>
"We will take advantage of the nighttime and try to get some
things established," Lindbery said. "But when the east wind comes
up in the morning, it makes things difficult."
</P>
<P>
The third wildfire has burned 100 acres near Camino in northern
California, where official evacuated 50 homes as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, worse wildfires claimed lives and burned
tens of thousands of brush and trees in the state.
</P>
<P>
October traditionally sees the start of the southern California
fire season as hot winds known as Santa Anas blow in from the
desert.
</P>
<P>
But officials fear that this year's fire season might be worse
than usual because storms spurred by the El Nino weather
phenomenon that soaked the area earlier this year have spurred
lush growth of thick underbrush.

<HEADLINE> Prison Inmates in New Zealand Reach 5,300 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- About 5,300 people were in
New Zealand prisons and 47,000 were given community-based
sentences in the past 12 months, the Dominion newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted the annual report of the
New Zealand Corrections Department as saying that in the past 10
years the imprisonment rate has increased by 58 percent and the
prison population is expected to reach 6,000 by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The department spent 350 million New Zealand dollars (186
million U.S. dollars) on managing prisoners in the past year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Disturbances during the year included a hostage incident, a
riot, suicides and 84 escapes, it added.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Corrections Department employs about 4,000
part- and full-time staff, and operates 16 prisons, 16 community
probation service offices and 220 service sites, eight
psychological service offices, three special treatment units and a
head office.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Government intends to acquire five new prison
sites to meet a forecast 22 percent prison population increase by
2020, according to the newspaper.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Misgivings Prevail Over Kosovo Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Although the
situation in Kosovo has quieted down following the conclusion of
the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement, pessimism remains prevalent
over the prospects of an ultimate settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Kosovo Information Bureau Director
Bosko Drobnjak said that the October 13 peace deal had headed off
an impending armed intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, but the situation in Kosovo remained unstable.
</P>
<P>
During Belgrade's military pullback last week, separatist
guerrillas in Kosovo have repeatedly attacked Serb policemen, with
five killed and nine wounded, Drobnjak said. Two journalists from
the Tanjug news agency were found missing.
</P>
<P>
The official said that despite a worldwide acclaim for the
peace deal reached between the Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, the Albanian leaders
in Kosovo still refused to accept it. "That is the biggest
obstacle to the solution of the Kosovo crisis," he noted.
</P>
<P>
What was most important, the official said, was to create a
peaceful atmosphere for the restart of negotiations concerning the
future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that if the Albanian representatives
continued to reject dialogues and negotiations, the Serbian
government will act to handle the crisis in accordance with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He accused the West of giving unprincipled protection to the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, which, he said, had whetted the
ambitions of the Albanian extremists to split the country and
rendered the situation in the region more complicated.
</P>
<P>
He said some Western countries wanted to take control of Kosovo
for its strategic importance. Therefore, they had been trying to
provoke and get involved in the conflicts, and did not balk at
intervention by force.
</P>
<P>
He said there was hope for a final settlement of the Kosovo
crisis only if the West stopped interfering in Yugoslavia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with Xinhua, Fehmi Agani, chief of the
five-member negotiation team of the ethic Albanians also expressed
concerns over the fate of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said the ethnic Albanians accepted the Milosevic-Holbrooke
agreement and were willing to negotiate with the Yugoslav
government over Kosovo's future on condition that the status of
Kosovo be decided upon first.
</P>
<P>
Agani said the Albanians were willing to remain in Yugoslavia
if they were granted a status like Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
He said his party, the League of Democracy of Kosovo (LDK),
realized that "it is impossible for Kosovo to gain full
independence in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the peace deal struck a week ago, he said that his
party, the largest political party in Kosovo, supported it and
welcomes the OSCE mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord, a 2,000-strong verification force of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
will be deployed in Kosovo to ensure the withdrawal of Serb forces
and the safe return of tens of thousands of refugees and displaced
people.
</P>
<P>
"But we haven't signed the agreement yet because the status of
Kosovo has not been settled," Agani said.
</P>
<P>
Softening the tone of the ethnic Albanians who insist on full
independence, Agani said he was willing to settle the Kosovo
crisis within Yugoslavia, but not inside Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo earlier rejected a political
solution to the dispute, which promised an election within nine
months and the set-up of a police force in Kosovo reflecting the
ethnic make-up in the province.
</P>
<P>
Agani, also LDK vice-chairman, said he was ready to start
negotiations with the Serb government on the future of Kosovo in
which 90 percent of the two million people are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to discuss the proposals with the Serbian
government," he added, but giving no date for new talks.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he was pessimistic about the prospect of a
political settlement of the Kosovo crisis within Yugoslavia
because the the positions of the two sides were far apart.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav leaders have never backed down on their position
that Kosovo is the internal affairs of Serbia and therefore must
be settled within the Serbian Republic that makes up the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia with Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Even Western countries are opposed to the full independence of
Kosovo. There are fears that ethnic Albanians living in
neighboring Macedonia, where they make up a quarter of the
population, will also revolt and demand joining a greater Albania,
thus plunging the region into further turmoils.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to accept an interim agreement to stay for a
period of time in Yugoslavia, but after perhaps three years, there
must be a referendum which will decide the fate of Kosovo," Agani
said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian chief negotiator said that although formal talks
with the Serbs have been suspended, unofficial engagement and
indirect talks with the Serb government have never come to a
standstill. "We wish to talk with them, but the talks must begin
without any preconditions and in a peaceful atmosphere," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether the radical Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) will accept the plan to stay in Yugoslavia, he said he
believed if they could figure out a political solution acceptable
to most Albanians, the KLA would also agree with it.
</P>
<P>
The KLA, whose sole goal is independence for Kosovo, had fought
a seven-month war with the Serbian forces before a ceasefire 10
days ago.

<HEADLINE> Central Chinese Overseas Investment Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment has become
a major force in economic growth in central China's Hunan
province, Deputy-Governor He Tongxin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,600 foreign-funded enterprises have been approved
in Hunan in the past few years, involving 5.1 billion U.S.
dollars worth of investment, and their output accounted for six
percent of the province's GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3.1 billion dollars of direct overseas investment has
been utilized, while many multinationals are playing a role in
changing the local industrial structure, the official said.
</P>
<P>
About half of the Sino-foreign joint ventures are in
production, employing 330,000 local people.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, they exported 398 million dollars worth of products,
accounting for 17 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The deputy-governor said that overseas investors have also been
participating in local infrastructure projects. Overseas
investment accounted for 32 percent of the investment in the
province's energy and transportation sectors in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Discuss Human Rights in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The human rights situation in
China has become one of the focuses of discussion at an
international symposium on human rights which began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese enjoy a high level of economic, political,
cultural, and individual rights that were unimaginable 20 years
ago, Prof. Norbert Meienberger of Zurich University said at the
International Symposium on World Human Rights toward the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored jointly by the China Society for Human
Rights Studies and the China UN Association, has drawn scholars
from China and 26 other countries from Asia, Africa, Latin
America, Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Meienberger, who visited China for several times in the 1970s,
said some Westerners know little about China's past, and neither
do they know much about its present.
</P>
<P>
They usually reprimand China for its human rights situation
from their own political stand, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Even so, China still has a long way to go in improving human
rights because it was ravaged by years of war and turmoil, said
Alice Erh-soon Tay, president of the Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Commission, Australia, who saw the symposium as a
forum for people from different countries to freely discuss human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the situation, the Chinese government has showed its
determination to development human rights in the country by
signing a series of international conventions on human rights in
recent years, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights, sent such a message to the
world again that China will go further in its human rights and
democracy, said David Dubois, a Sinologist and professor at the
University of Massachusetts, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sharing similar views with Meienberger, Dubois added that
certain attacks on China's human rights record may be attributed
to worry about China's growing economic strength.

<HEADLINE> Market for Information Appliances to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The global market for
information appliances is "on the verge of explosive growth," said
a U.S. market analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to climb from three million units in
1997 and nearly six million this year to an overwhelming 55.7
million in 2002 worldwide, registering a 76 percent annual growth
rate between 1998 and 2002, according to a report by the
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Information appliances are household or office devices that can
be plugged into common public or private networks.
</P>
<P>
In late 1998, the industry has begun to coalesce around key
platforms and specific solution partnership initiatives. On the
down side are network computers and screenphones. But the lion's
share of the information appliance momentum has moved toward
internet TV, gaming devices and smart handhelds, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Internet smart handheld devices show the greatest promise for
deployment on an absolute unit shipment basis. However, IDC said,
these products primarily lie in the corporate domain, with many
purchased directly by corporate funds. As a result, these
handhelds will drop out of the top ranking and get closer to the
bottom of unit shipments for consumer-used items.
</P>
<P>
Internet gaming devices also have great potential, with the
growth accelerating from 848,000 units in 1998 to almost 15
million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Internet TVs represent a hot bed of innovation, the report
said. They will quickly become the next largest category of
information appliances, generating 1.4 million units in 1998, 4.3
million in 1999 and over 11 million units at the turn of the
millennium. At present, Internet TV services use a set-top box
that connects the TV to a modem and telephone.

<HEADLINE> Northern China Oil Production Not Affected by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Daqing Oilfield, China's
largest oil production base in the northeast, will not be affected
by this year's floods and will meet the year's production quota of
55.7 million tons of oil on schedule, Mayor Yang Xin has promised.
</P>
<P>
Daqing, which was also built as China's largest petrochemical
production base, has 30 million sq km of oilfields and recorded
an annual production of 50 million tons of oil for 22 years. It now
processes 14 million tons of crude oil annually.
</P>
<P>
The city was hit by severe flooding this summer, but the
principal production oil wells were not affected thanks to the
hard work of soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Only two percent of the oilfield's daily production capacity
was affected even at the most severe flood levels, according to
Yang, mayor of Daqing which was built on the basis of the giant
oil producer.
</P>
<P>
Daqing's 50-million-ton annual capacity will last until the
year 2010, he told an economic and technological cooperation fair
which is going on in south China's Hunan Province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Forest Shelter Project Helps Stop Advance of Sand Dunes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The forest shelter project in
north, northwest and northeast China that began in 1978 has had
some encouraging results.
</P>
<P>
In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which accounts for 10
million hectares, or one third of the designed hectareage for the
project, trees have been planted on 4 million hectares and another
one million hectares are being planted.
</P>
<P>
The project has helped improve natural conditions on more than
5 million hectares of arid land and stop soil erosion on 4 million
hectares of land at barren hillside, according to Gao Xilin,
deputy director of the region's forestry bureau.
</P>
<P>
The project has also protected over one million hectares of
farmland and more than 2 million hectares of pastures.
</P>
<P>
Gao says that the project's success has much to do with the
forestry research in the region. In the past decade, the region
has made 400 scientific research achievements, more than 40 percent
of which have been used for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed by the year 2050.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Host UNCTAD Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will host the 10th
international meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) in the year 2000, according to the Thai
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the U.N. development forum, which was agreed upon by
the Thai cabinet Tuesday, will enable Thailand to play a key role
in laying down the future principle of international economic
development strategies by taking into account the interest of
developing countries, Kitti Wasinondh, Foreign Ministry deputy
spokesman was quoted Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
In concrete terms, the UNCTAD's plan to establish an Institute
for Comparative Development in Thailand will increase Bangkok's
role in development fields, Kitti said.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that Thailand will earn about 8.9 million
U.S. dollars from the spending of 3,000 participants from 188
members due to attend the forum, Kitti said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said recently that the UNCTAD's conference in the
next two years will be a "turning point" for Asia to show the rest
of the world that it has successfully recovered from the
recession.
</P>
<P>
Starting in Bangkok in July last year, the financial crisis
spread throughout the region, resulting in devaluation of regional
currencies, collapse of insolvent firms and massive unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD was established in 1964 and played a key role in
voicing the positions of developing countries in many
international trade negotiation forums.
</P>
<P>
The 10th UNCTAD meeting will bring together government leaders
as well as ministers. The ministerial meeting normally takes place
every four years with a rotation of host countries among Asia,
Africa and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Set Up Two "Toy Cities" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government plans
to set up two "toy cities" in a bid to expand its toy export base
in the world market, official sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two "cities," or new manufacturing zones, being established
in Navi Mumbai, 1,407 kilometers southwest of New Delhi, and
Greater Noida near New Delhi, will target buyers in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Our toy industry is poised for a major breakthrough in the
export market since we have the potential, capability and
entrepreneurship," said R. H. Naqvi, executive director of the
Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council, which
has been designated by the Commerce Ministry to service the export
interests of toy manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
For the Navi Mumbai production zone, for instance, the Small
Scale Industries Development Corporation has allotted over 40
hectares. The complex would not be just an industrial center but
an integrated "city," complete with not only production units and
showrooms but also design centers, facilities to give
technological inputs and quality improvement and a toy museum.
</P>
<P>
Export of toys from India has been marginal but the growth has
been impressive of late, rising from 2.89 million U.S. dollars in
value in 1995-96 to 15 million dollars in 1996-97 and 16 million
dollars in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Up 44.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in the first half of fiscal 1998 jumped 44.7 percent from the
previous year to 7,410.8 billion yen (about 53.9 billion
U.S. dollars), the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials attributed the increase to Japan's poor domestic
demand stemming from the recession and to robust demand for Japanese
goods in European and U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
Overall exports increased 2.4 percent to 25,908.7 billion yen
(about 188.5 billion dollars) in the April-September period, the ninth
straight half-year of growth, while imports fell 8.3 percent to
18,497.8 billion yen (about 134.6 billion dollars), the second
straight half-yearly drop, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
In the April-September period, Japan's politically sensitive
trade surplus with the United States increased 41.3 percent to
3,424.2 billion yen (about 24.9 billion dollars), extending its
winning streak to the fourth straight half-year term, boosted by
strong demand in the U.S. for Japanese vehicles and steel products.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with other Asian nations tumbled 35.5 percent
to 2,104.1 billion yen (about 15.3 billion dollars), the first fall in
three half-year periods, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus with the 15-member European Union (EU) soared
88.1 percent to 2,197.0 billion yen (about 15.9 billion dollars),
marking the eighth straight gain for a half-year term.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of goods
clearing customs and is reported before adjustment for seasonal
factors.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen averaged 137.47 to the U.S. dollar in the
reporting period, down 13.4 percent from the year-earlier level. A
weak yen lowers the price of Japanese products overseas and increases
the yen value of sales in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade balance hinges on the yen's value against the dollar,
an economist at a private financial institution said.
</P>
<P>
"If the yen goes up further, imports will increase and the surplus
will begin to narrow. But if the correction of the weak yen comes to a
halt and the currency falls back, the trend will remain unchanged," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Finnish Relations in Vigorous Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen will start a five-day official visit to China next
Monday, widely expected to bring existing dynamic overall
Sino-Finnish friendship and cooperation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Finland and China have maintained a sound and smooth
relationship in the last five decades, which saw the world in much
turmoil and rapid changes.
</P>
<P>
The 1990s marked a new phase in the Sino-Finnish friendship
with frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In July 1995, President Jiang Zemin made a landmark visit to
Finland as the first Chinese president visiting the Nordic
country. Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari returned the visit in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, just after the Communist Party of China
(CPC) concluded its 15th National Congress, the two presidents met
again as Ahtisaari made a stopover in Beijing on his way to
Japan. The Finnish president became the first foreign leader that
heard Jiang's briefing on the CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The smooth progress of the Sino-Finnish political relations has
promoted an all-round development of bilateral ties in the fields
of economy and trade, science and technology as well as defense
and culture.
</P>
<P>
As far back as in 1953, China and Finland signed a governmental
trade and payment agreement -- the first between the People's
Republic of China and a Western country.
</P>
<P>
In the many years that followed, bilateral trade has been
growing steadily on the basis of mutual benefit and supplying each
other's needs.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1990s, with Finland's new strategy to explore the
Asian market, Sino-Finnish trade has been increasing at a high
rate averaging 20 percent annually, easily meeting the target of
doubling bilateral trade volume within three years, as set by the
two presidents.
</P>
<P>
Finland, with a population of 5.1 million, is a world leader in
forest industry, paper machinery, telecommunications,
environmental protection and biological technology. Sino-Finnish
cooperation in science and technology has been an important
driving force in the bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Significant achievements in combining technology with trade
included Sino-Finnish joint projects of transporting water from
the suburban Miyun reservoir to Beijing in the winter season,
preventing floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River caused
by melted ice and fur processing in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the two countries had signed 96 contracts
importing Finnish technology into China with a total value of 656
million U.S. dollars, in areas including nonferrous metallurgy,
paper making and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the two countries signed an agreement to
build a Sino-Finnish science and technology park to strengthen
their cooperation in personnel training, business management and
supporting enterprise development.
</P>
<P>
Active financial cooperation has provided a key channel for the
rapid development of bilateral economic and trade relations. The
Finnish government started to give China mixed loans as early as
in the mid-1980s when the two countries reached credit agreement.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, loan agreements were signed on 66
contracts with a total of 370 million dollars in government
preferential loans from Finland, for projects including paper
making, wood processing, urban heating, energy, communication and
health care.
</P>
<P>
Finland established its first joint venture in China in 1984
and has since set up more than 70 such ventures, with investment
of 280 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prestigious Finnish companies including Nokia have their
manufacture and research bases in China aimed at long-term
development as the Chinese market has provided huge opportunities
for Finnish enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the defense sector, contacts between military leaders of the
two countries have also markedly increased in the past years.
</P>
<P>
In the cultural sector, exchanges between the two countries
have been flourishing in the last few years, contributing to the
mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
It is widely agreed that Finland and China are expecting an
even brighter future with the coming of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reports Record Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the
world's largest software-maker, Tuesday reported a 153 percent
rise in its first-quarter operating earnings, compared the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
News release from the company said the software giant earned
1.68 billion U.S. dollars in the quarter ended on September 30, up
from 663 million dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 26 percent to 3.95 billion dollars from 3.13
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft admitted that the results for the just-ended quarter
reflected a one-time gain of 160 million dollars from the sale of
the software subsidiary SoftImage as well as a write-off of 296
million dollars related to the purchase of WebTV networks.
</P>
<P>
Excluding one-time items, Microsoft said it earned 1.52 billion
dollars in the first quarter, up 58 percent from 959 million
dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrific quarter," said analyst Rick Sherlund of
Goldman Sachs in New York, "the margins are at record levels and
they gave very bullish guidance going forward."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft attributed its record earnings to surprisingly strong
overseas demand for its new Windows 98 operating system, launched
on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The company said it has sold 10 million copies of Windows 98,
either as retail packages or with new computers. The demand for
Windows 98 was stronger than expected in several European
countries and Japan, although the overall outlook for Asia remains
"tepid," according to the news release.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted the earnings were posted as Microsoft's lawyers
defended it in a federal court in Washington D.C., against the
government's landmark antitrust lawsuit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
The government contends Microsoft used its influence as the
maker of Windows to try to dominate other software markets.
Microsoft says that while it played hard against competitors, it
played fair.

<HEADLINE> Report Calls for Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Romanian experts Tuesday
urged the government to work out a national strategy on the
prevention of juvenile delinquency which is on the rise in the
country over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Romanian Procurator Office's research institute
said the number of juvenile offenders reached 41,898 in 1997, as
against 18,500 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 18,000 young people were detained in 1997 for
stealing and robbery and other offenses include murder and rape,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the juvenile offenders were brought up in
unharmonious families and many came from families where the
parents were unemployed or little educated.
</P>
<P>
The report said a national policy must be worked out
immediately to strengthen the work on youth and children, ensure a
good education for them and encourage them to take an active part
in social activities in efforts to reduce the rate of juvenile
delinquency.

<HEADLINE> Poland Passes Draft Resolution on Approval of NATO Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government Tuesday
unanimously passed a draft resolution on the country's
ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The move has come as an immediate follow-up to Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek's visit to the headquarters of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO). The document has reportedly been
submitted to the parliament for endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony of the draft resolution, Buzek
said: "What matters is that Poland does not have to wait until the
scheduled April 1999 for entry into NATO, but to join the
organization two or three months earlier so that the country will
be able to participate as a full member in celebrations marking
NATO's fiftieth anniversary."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister believed that Poland would be more secure
and stable than ever before after joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
During talks with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in
Brussels earlier, Buzek expressed Poland's wish for an early entry
into NATO. Solana urged Poland to get prepared as early as
possible, saying that "almost everything depends on you."
</P>
<P>
Poland started to bid for NATO membership in the early 1990s,
which reflected not only the country's wish but also the needs of
the global strategy of NATO, and particularly the United States,
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
NATO's eastward expansion has encountered Russia's strong
boycotts and opposition, which, however, has failed to halt the
process. Instead, the last two years has witnessed an obvious
acceleration of the expansion move.
</P>
<P>
Last July, NATO formally invited Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary to join the organization and signed protocols on the issue
with the three countries in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year, most parliaments of NATO's 16 member countries have
given a go-ahead to the protocols. Latest reports here said that
Poland was expected to be admitted into NATO next January.

The deserters who surrender during the amnesty period would be
re-trained, re-equipped and sent to their respective regiments.
Their salaries and allowances would be paid from the date of
rejoining the service, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The deserters were being recalled as an alternative to
conscription to strengthen the army in the wake of the on-going
war in the north and east of the country against the Tamil rebels
who have been fighting for 15 years for a separate state.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the number of deserters was near 25,000 by May
this year. Since 1995, the army has offered amnesty to deserters
on several occasions, and more than 14,500 of them had returned
for their duty.
</P>
<P>
The police and army Tuesday began a search operation to arrest
the other deserters.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ask EU for Three-Year GSP Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will formally ask the
European Union (EU) to maintain preferential tariffs for it on
three key agricultural exports for three more years instead of
ending them as scheduled on January 1.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Commerce Ministry and Foreign Ministry will jointly
make the request for the grace period to the European Commission,
according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP), developing
countries are allowed to export certain products to the EU at
lower tariffs in order to help them build markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been gradually raising tariffs on several categories
of Thai goods, which used to enjoy more favorable rates. The GSP
protection for Thailand will end completely on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Next year, fresh shrimp will be taxed at 14.4 percent, compared
with 9.7 percent currently, and 4.5 percent before 1997. Boiled
shrimp will be taxed at 20 percent, compared with 13.5 percent now
and 6 percent before 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EU will raise tariffs on Thai fresh fruit next year to 10.6
percent, compared with 9 percent currently, and 6 percent in the
years before 1997.
</P>
<P>
The tariffs on fresh flowers, now 20.4 percent, will rise to 22
percent from 15 percent before 1997. Processed pineapple will face
tariffs ranging from 21.3 percent to 25.1 percent, compared with
19.7 percent to 23.2 percent currently, and 12-15 percent prior to
1997.
</P>
<P>
Pisanu Rienmahasarn, deputy director-general of the Foreign
Trade Department of the Thai Commerce Ministry, was quoted
Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying that Thailand had a chance
if the Europeans could be made to understand how much the economy
had slumped in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU decided to terminate GSP rates for Thailand
based on earlier economic growth indicators. Per capita annual
income in one figure used to determine whether a country should be
"graduated" from the program, and the method of calculating the
figure has been disputed.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of Thailand is expected to fall this year by
7 percent, from about 2,000 U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Somsak Paneetatyasai, vice-president of the Thai Frozen Foods
Association, said Shrimp exports to the EU would be severely
affected if the GSP was removed.
</P>
<P>
Thai shrimp exports to the EU over the first seven months of
this year rose year-on-year by 27.35 percent to 9,302 tons, with
the value rising by 123.98 percent to 3.8 billion baht (95 million
U.S. dollars), Somsak said. This was mainly because the EU had
banned shrimp imports from India and Pakistan for several months
on sanitary grounds.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Thailand's fourth largest shrimp export market. Last
year, it imported 12,993 tons of Thai shrimp worth 3.7 billion
Baht (92.5 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Austrian F.M. Urges Restraint by Kosovo Liberation Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel Tuesday urged utmost restraint by the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) so as to allow tens of thousands of refugees
to return home before the onset of winter.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel, whose country now holds the European Union's
rotating presidency, said at a press conference that the deal
struck by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic may not meet every demand of the
ethnic Albanians, but the KLA should still support the agreement
already reached.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for ground and aerial verification of the
situation in Kosovo, and for political negotiations over the
future status of the southern Serbian province to continue under
U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe is due to send a 2,000-strong verification mission to
Kosovo and monitor Yugoslavia's compliance with relative
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel called for election in Kosovo within the next six
months and expressed belief that agreements could be reached soon
under the elected new leadership.

<HEADLINE> Internet Pioneer Jonathan Postel Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Jonathan Postel, an
Internet pioneer, died at the age of 55 in a Los Angeles hospital
over the weekend following a heart surgery, his friends and
colleagues said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Postel, who was often called "the father of the Internet,"
began his work linking computers in the 1960s when he was a
graduate student at the University of California in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
He was director of the controversial Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority, which assigns Internet addresses throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He remained active in Internet policy matters until his
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
On October 2, he presented what he called a consensus solution
from the Internet community to the Clinton administration -- a
plan to put management of the addressing system into the hands of
a private non-profit group.
</P>
<P>
"Jon Postel was an important historical figure in the
development of the Internet," one of his colleagues, Network
Solutions Inc. Chief Executive Officer Gabe Battista, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said Postel's work over the past decades "played a
significant part in the worldwide growth and development of the
Internet as we know it today."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes 520 Billion Dollar Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Tuesday approved a 520 billion U.S. dollar
spending bill offering cash to farmers, teachers and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The 333-95 vote reflected a compromise, reached last week
between the White House and congressional leaders, that gave both
parties victories to brag about.
</P>
<P>
It also indicated that most lawmakers were weary of the 1998
budget fight and eager to go home to take part in the campaign for
the November 3 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
Republicans could claim their victories such as blocking
President Clinton's plans for voluntary national student testing,
boosting spending against illegal drugs and winning more than 8
billion dollars for military readiness and other Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Democrats talked of money they won to let
communities begin hiring 100,000 teachers, help poor families pay
heating bills, provide summer jobs for youths and clean up toxic
wastes.
</P>
<P>
Still, large numbers of both Republicans and Democrats were
voting for the measure. That phenomenon stood in contrast to a
year that saw the two parties square off repeatedly over budget
priorities, health care, campaign finance law, tobacco regulation
and Clinton's possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The legislation covers almost a third of the 1.7 trillion
dollar federal budget for fiscal 1999, which started from October
1. It is an amalgam of eight of the 13 spending bills for the
year that were overdue because of disputes between the two parties
and within the GOP itself.
</P>
<P>
The over-4,000-page-long bill also includes providing 18
billion dollars for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
putting a three-year moratorium on new taxes on Internet
commerce. It would prepare government computers for the year 2000
and help 40,000 Haitian immigrants become permanent U.S. residents.
</P>
<P>
The House Speaker Newt Gingrich defended the legislation
against accusations by some conservatives that it represented a
retreat from Republican goals of cutting taxes and spending.

<HEADLINE> Worldwatch Hopes Climate Change Conference Makes Difference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-based Worldwatch
Institute Tuesday hoped the coming conference on climate change in
Brazil can dissolve the obstacles hindering reduction of the green
house gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Three sticking questions unresolved would be faced by the
negotiators in the fourth conference of the parties to the Climate
Change Treaty next month in Buenos Aires, said Christopher Flavin,
vice president of Worldwatch Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
These questions include developing countries' role in slowing
the pace of world-wide unfavorable climate change, the so called
"Carbon Sinks" for the developed nations and the Emissions Trading
issues.
</P>
<P>
Flavin said that the opinion gap between the United States and
the developing world appears to be widening since the last
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The United States said it would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol
passed at the last conference without "scheduled commitments to
limit or reduce emissions" by developing countries. However most
developing countries' per capita emissions are less than one-tenth
of the U.S.'s level. Most developing countries therefore opposed
to adopt early emission limits, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the "carbon sinks" issue, said Flavin, the Kyoto Protocol
provides that industrial countries have the option to offset their
greenhouse gas emissions by taking the greenhouse gas absorbed by
their forests into account. But the Worldwatch thinks there is no
scientific ground to provide such an option.
</P>
<P>
Emissions trading is a potentially effective means of ensuring
the cost-effectiveness of emissions reduction investments. But
this concept might also be undermined by the unnecessarily
generous emissions reduction allowances provided by the United
States to Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan to pay Russia tens of billions of U.S. dollars as
"hot air" emissions allowance is under extensive criticism by many
environmental protection organizations including the Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
Conditions are ripe now for the governments and industrial
sector to take the leadership in making more ambitious plans to
slow the unfavorable change of the world climate.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Professor Sees Bright Prospects for Human Rights in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Human rights in China have
bright prospects, said Swiss Professor Norbert Meienberger from
Zurich University, who is here to take part in the on-going
International Symposium on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Meienberger, a renown Sinologist in Switzerland, has visited
China for several times since 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with Xinhua, he expressed his opinion about the
differences between Chinese and Western conceptions of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Western conception, the Chinese conception
is much more comprehensive as it is not limited to the classic
political and civil rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China emphasizes more on the rights to subsist and to
develop," Meienberger added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the differences are caused by different
historical, economic and cultural background in China and Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to him, one of the main reasons that hinter the
development of human rights in China is the legacy of China's long
feudal history that still haunts its present.
</P>
<P>
"Feudalism was certainly no hotbed for human rights", he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 20th century was in China "a time of
revolution and armed resistance" and it was not the period to be
preoccupied with human rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Cultural Revolution "was devastating China"
just at a time when orderly and lawful government was needed even
more than before. Even today, neglecting the law still occurs
frequently in China.
</P>
<P>
"Under such conditions, do human rights in China have bright
prospects? The answer is yes." said the Swiss Sinologist.
</P>
<P>
"As great changes have taken place, the policy of reforms and
opening up has helped improve the living condition of the Chinese
people in the past twenty years to such an extent. I am convinced
that the Chinese government will continue the policy of reform and
opening," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "the forces accusing China" mainly consist
of three groupings. The first is "anti-communist elements who are
interested in continuing the cold war". They are not necessarily
interested in human rights, but they welcome criticism along these
lines "because it adds fuel to their cause".
</P>
<P>
The second, he said, is made up of people who believe only the
West has correct conception of human rights. They assume that
China should adopt the Western conception, including Western
democracy, as a prerequisite to be able to observe human rights.
</P>
<P>
It reflects sort of cultural imperialist thinking, Meienberger
noted.
</P>
<P>
A third group of critics comprises mainly civil servants and
scholars who see that the situation in China is not ideal and wish
to discuss ways and means with the Chinese side for the betterment
of the application of human rights in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that criticism of the human rights situation in
China "deeply roots in anti-communism and cultural imperialism and
reflects only in part genuine concern of foreigners for an
improvement of the situation in China".

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Continues to Increase in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors injected
more than two billion U.S. dollars of capital in real terms into
businesses in the Chinese capital Beijing during the first three
quarters of this year, an increase of 18.6 percent on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Beijing Municipal Committee of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation say that the city approved 503 foreign-funded
enterprises in the nine months, with contracted foreign investment
involved grew 29.4 percent year on year to 3.19 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum is attributed to the increase of foreign
direct investment, which grew 20.4 percent year on year to 1.41
billion U.S. dollars in the nine months to September.
</P>
<P>
Over 54 percent, or 770 million U.S. dollars, of the foreign
direct investment was put into the real estate industry, which
remained the focus of foreign investment in the city.
</P>
<P>
The increased foreign investment is also attributed to
increases by well-known multinationals, which funded over 30
projects in Beijing, with combined investment reaching 950 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Visits Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Communist Party General
Secretary Le Kha Phieu met with Russian Defense Minister Marshal
I.D. Sergeyev Tuesday, official media reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev and his high-ranking military delegation arrived here
Tuesday for an official visit to Vietnam at the invitation of his
Vietnamese counterpart Pham Van Tra.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev informed Phieu of the outcome of his earlier talks
with Tra.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev stressed the "similarities between Russia and Vietnam
and the two sides' resolve to further develop their time-honored
friendship and cooperation," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev promised that Russia will "do its utmost to maintain
and boost bilateral ties for mutual interest."
</P>
<P>
There remains great potential for boosting bilateral
cooperation in economic, commercial, national defense, scientific,
cultural and social domains between Vietnam and Russia, the
Vietnamese party leader noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian sources here, during Sergeyev's meeting
with Tra on Tuesday, the Russian side expressed the hope to
maintain its presence in Vietnam's Cam Ranh bay. The two sides
will hold negotiation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Cam Ranh bay, a former U.S. navy base, was rent to the former
Soviet Union in 1979. After the disintegration of the Soviet
Union, a treaty was signed in 1993 by Vietnam and Russia, allowing
the latter to continue using the Cam Ranh base until 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister is scheduled to leave here
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Value of Thai Export Products Slips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The dollar value of Thailand's
export products in several key sectors, especially farm and
agro-industrial goods, declined by 15 percent in the first eight
months of this year despite an increase in volume of 11.5 percent,
according to a report issued by the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from rice exports fell year-on-year by 20 percent to
1.39 billion U.S. dollars, though the export volume rose by 34.7
percent over the 4.3 million tons recorded in the first eight
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of frozen and processed chicken exports fell by 20.5
percent and that of rubber by 36.8 percent, while the export
volumes increased by 46.4 percent and 10.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hard bargaining by importers was partially responsible for the
decline in value, said the report available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from exports of integrated circuits totaled 1.47
billion dollars (down 12.6 percent), gems and jewelry 888 million
dollars (down 23.2 percent), shoes and accessories 613 million
dollars (down 21 percent), and plastic pellets and products 470
million dollars (down 14.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the regional economic crisis had reduced
the purchasing power in Asian markets, while the financial crisis
in Russia had weakened imports from Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Official export figures for the first eight months of the year
showed a decline in dollar value by 5.2 percent to 35.96 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports also dropped substantially, resulting in a trade
surplus of 7.4 billion U.S. dollars for the period.

In a faxed message to the Cambodia Daily, King Sihanouk said he
would leave Cambodia round November 11.
</P>
<P>
The King had already delayed his trip to Beijing for medical
treatment after senior government officials urged him to stay
until a coalition government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The King, who came here on October 5, last came to Phnom Penh
on December 3, 1997, and stayed until Jan 5 when he abruptly left
the capital for Beijing. He has been at his royal residence in
Siem Reap since April 11.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the King's stay in the country will
ease tensions between the two rival parties, one of them is led by
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and other headed by Prince Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said King Sihanouk is respected by all sides and is in
a position to help end the current political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Once the King leaves, Cambodia will be without a legal head of
state unless the National Assembly meets and chooses a president.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party have urged the King to hold
a summit in Beijing instead of Phnom Penh, where opposition
leaders have said they might not be safe.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen have opposed talks outside Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
But CPP spokesman Khieu Kanharith said the ruling party would
not refuse a direct request from the monarch if he decided to call
a summit in Beijing after leaving.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said his party would love to have a
coalition agreement before the King's departure. "For us, the
sooner, the better, but we have to wait for those on the outside
to come back."

<HEADLINE> Brazil, IMF Close to 30 Billion Dollar Bailout Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZILIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Tuesday were near to an agreement on a 30
billion U.S. dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and other
private banks are expected to fund the bailout package, according
to a joint statement issued on Tuesday by Brazil and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is reportedly the latest victim of the financial crisis
started in Asia last year. Brazil has lost 25 billion dollars in
foreign exchange reserves since August this year, when Russia's
debt default caused new investment crises in many emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts fear that instability in Brazil may develop into
an overall economic crisis in the whole Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The Brazil-IMF statement said the two sides held talks this
weekend to prepare "the ground for prompt support from the
international community, including the IMF, for the multi-year
fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian government,
which will include new policy initiatives" in dealing with the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue their talks to reach a formal
agreement, the statement announced.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farms Raising Shrimp, Blowfish Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The prawn is delicious but
difficult to raise because of its delicate temperament while the
blowfish is a great delicacy for some, especially Japanese, but it
can be extremely poisonous.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the northern China city of Zhuanghe in Hebei
Province have developed a technique to feed the two together.
</P>
<P>
They have found that breeding the two in the same pond has
helped stop diseases that kill prawn and has given high yields of
blowfish. The excrement of the fish helps to disinfect the prawn
ponds and counter diseases, while the prawn killed by diseases
provide food for the fish.
</P>
<P>
With 6,700 hectares of prawn farms, Zhuanghe has become a major
prawn-cultivating base of the country. Since 1993, Chinese fish
farms have suffered heavy losses because of the spread of
diseases, but many farms in the city have avoided disaster thanks
to the technique.

</P>
<P>
Police searched them after a junior official from the Albanian
intelligence bureau showed up to greet them. Two kilograms of

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Open Domestic Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Participants in an Italy-Japan
Business Group meeting Tuesday urged Japan to get rid of
protectionism and open its domestic market if it wants to overcome
its current economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th assembly of the group held here Tuesday,
World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General Renato Ruggiero,
an Italian, observed that protectionism "could turn out to be a
tragic mistake. No nation today can afford to build walls against
investment."
</P>
<P>
On ties between Italy and Japan, Ruggiero said their "relations
have improved, but they have not yet reached their potential."
</P>
<P>
He added that the effects of the crisis in Japan are beginning
to be felt here. In the first eight months of the year, Italy's
exports to Japan dropped 8 percent, while the imports went up 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero's viewpoints were echoed by some Italian senior
officials and businessmen participating in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said that in
order to resolve Japan's problems, fiscal measures alone are not
enough and the best way is to open its domestic market to foreign
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Fantozzi went on to say that Italy has good prospects to
attract foreign investment, in particular from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The need to bolster cooperation between Italy, a member nation
of the European Union, and Japan was stressed by Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini, who said that this would help ensure the
success of the process of opening and liberalizing markets.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation, Dini said, must also and above all aim at
avoiding any temptation of protectionism, which he described as a
step backward that can only pave the way for new economic, social
and political conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 government officials, businessmen, economists from
both Italy and Japan took part in the annual meeting.

<HEADLINE> Platinum, Diamond Jewelry Popular In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Platinum and diamonds are
replacing gold and jadeite as the favorite ornament of the people
of Shanghai, according to sources at a recent gem and jade fair.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the fair showed 578 million yuan in sales of
platinum and diamond jewelry in the city last year in the city.
</P>
<P>
The jewelry shops of Shanghai now have special counters for
platinum and diamond jewelry and at least 90 shops are mainly
engaged in the processing and sale of platinum and diamond
jewelry. This is in marked contrast to five years ago, when there
were only a few shops in the trade.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the country's leading gold jewelry market and has
sold more than 130 tons of gold jewelry since it was allowed to
get into the business in 1982. But it sold only 4.25 tons of gold
jewelry from January to June this year, a drop of 12.6 percent
from the same period last year and the lowest period in the four
years. In 1993, it sold a record 22 tons of gold jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The number of gold jewelry shops has decreased from 380 in 1994
to 250 at present. To attract more customers, many of them have
started since 1993 a "changing new with the old" method, whereby a
customer can get new jewelry by paying to exchange or rework old
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Shrinking gold jewelry sales are largely blamed on gold's loss
of popularity as an investment while increased platinum and
diamond sales are attributed to international consumer trends and
the quality guarantees of platinum and diamond jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The world's diamond giant De Beers predicted that by the year
2000, China's diamond jewelry sales will exceed 20 billion yuan,
and that the country will become the world's third largest diamond
market, after the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
De Beers put China's diamond jewelry sales at 3.75 billion yuan
last year, a rise of 13.6 percent over 1996.

<P>
LOS AGNELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in the
U.S. state of Texas fled from their homes Tuesday as devastating
floods destroyed farmland and houses and claimed 20 lives, local
officials reported.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain, caused by humid air streaming off two hurricanes in
the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Mexico, has caused floods
in about 60 of the 254 counties in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have confirmed 20 deaths related to the
floods and Governor George W. Bush asked President Clinton to
declare 20 counties disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rainfall, which has soaked the area since the
weekend, appeared to be easing, but swollen rivers flooded cities
as the waters raced downstream.
</P>
<P>
In Cuero, a town of 7,000 some 90 miles (145 kilometers)
southeast of San Antonio, floods heavily hit the business areas
and destroyed one-fourth of houses, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
In Caldwell County, northeast of San Antonio, up to 5,000
cattle were roaming free -- set loose when the flooded San Marcos
River washed away pens, barns and hundreds of miles of fencing.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters from the Coast Guard and the Texas Department of
Public Safety were helping with the evacuation effort, picking up
stranded residents from their rooftops.
</P>
<P>
Insured losses related to the storms were expected to exceed 90
million U.S. dollar, the Southwestern Insurance Information
Service estimated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"These could be the most costly flood losses for insurers in
decades," said spokesman Jerry Johns.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Seeks Support for Border Dispute With Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad
left for Argentina and Chile Tuesday to seek support in a
long-running border dispute with Peru.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said he would seek the support of Presidents Carlos
Menem of Argentina and Eduardo Frei of Chile for his country's
claim on the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Peru's Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies said in Lima on
the same day that Mahuad's trip would not reverse a decision
reportedly made by the four mediating countries that Peru has the
sovereignty over the border area in dispute.
</P>
<P>
The mediating group is made up of Brazil, the United States,
Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Both Ecuador and Peru claim the Andean region of Tiwintza,
which extends over 49 miles (79 kilometers) of unmarked border in
a remote stretch of mountainous jungle.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have fought three wars in 1941, 1981 and
1995 over the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
In 1942, the two countries signed the Rio de Janeiro agreement
to settle the border dispute. The pact, however, has never been
accepted by Ecuador.

<HEADLINE> State Assets Increase Sharply in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Assets of state-owned
enterprises in Shenzhen, one of China's four special economic
zones, have become 960 times greater than 18 years ago, going from
161 million yuan to 155.76 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
These companies led the country in reaching economic goals in
returns on investment and profits.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has 79 top-tier state enterprises, 1,114 second-level,
and 8,000 jointly run with other provinces. They have played an
increasingly important role in economic development, a local
government official said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of taxes paid by state-owned enterprises last year
accounted for 51 percent of the city's total, compared with 14.7
percent in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the success to reforms of state-owned
companies, the introduction of a modern enterprise system, and the
issue stocks within enterprise staff.

FUZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Three South China Tiger cubs
have been sent from the Suzhou Zoo in east China's Jiangsu
Province to the Meihuashan Nature Reserve in the city of Longyan
in Fujian Province about 800 km southward.
</P>
<P>
The three cubs are the first tame tigers at a newly built South
China Tiger breeding center in the reserve, which is a natural
habitat for South China tigers, one of the most endangered animal
species in the world. It has a dozen wild South China Tigers.
</P>
<P>
When the three new tame tigers get old enough to have about a
dozen offspring in the 4-hectare center, they are expected to mate
with wild tigers to produce more South China Tigers.
</P>
<P>
The local government has spent 1.5 million yuan on the center
and will expand its area to 67 hectares.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Italy's new government will pursue
the European policy carried out by the outgoing central-left
administration led by Romano Prodi, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The European policy the Italian government has helped achieved
was used as an instrument to cope with the crisis sweeping the
financial market, Dini told the Italy-Japan Business Group session.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new government led by Massimo D'Alema of the
Left Democrat Party will provide a "strong signal" to the European
Union by strengthening the "government of the economy."
</P>
<P>
He said the European countries, Japan and the United States
should jointly push forward the international financial reform to
ensure the free movement of capital and the stability of the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Dini now serves as the foreign minister of a care-taker
cabinet. Prod's government lost the confidence vote at the house
of deputies on October 9 and resigned. President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro has asked D'Alema to form a new government.

<P>
SHANTOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Shantou in
Guangdong Province has spent 9.75 million yuan (about 1.2 million
U.S. dollars) on 70 environmental protection projects that have
made the city both beautiful and attractive to foreign investors.
</P>

The projects have increased the city's waste gas treatment
capacity by 67,300 standard cubic meters per hour and waste water
treatment capacity by 7,211 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
The city government has passed a series of laws and regulations

discharge waste materials. In March it issued licenses to the
first batch of about 1,000 work units.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two dust-control zones have been set up in an
87.5-square kilometer area, improving the city's air quality.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles were not allowed to use their horns in urban areas as

CARACAS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's 1999 revenues are
expected to drop by 1.1 billion dollars, one percent of its Gross

central budget office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the country's real GDP will also decrease next
year.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil sectors will also contract by one percent of GDP,

</P>
<P>
The country's 1998 estimated oil revenues are expected to show
a 500 million dollar shortfall, the office said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NBA Players' Union Considering Decertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- After losing its guaranteed
contracts in a ruling by an arbitrator, the NBA players' union
spent Tuesday pondering its latest loss and remained upbeat.
</P>
<P>
Union director Billy Hunter said: "The players will not back do
 wn. The sooner the owners realize this and end the lockout, the
quicker we can avoid enormous damage to the sport of basketball."
</P>
<P>
Some agents were pushing for decertification, a move that
could lead to a multi-year fight with the owners.
</P>
<P>
By decertifying, the union would remove itself as the official
bargaining agent for the players. A court injunction would be
sought to end the lockout.
</P>
<P>
If an injunction were granted, the owners would lift the
lockout, open camps and impose new work rules. If the new rules
were more restrictive than the old ones, the players would be
expected to file an antitrust suit against the league seeking
damages.
</P>
<P>
The agents' advisory council meets in Las Vegas on Wednesday.
Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone are among those
expected to attend a union meeting open to all players on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NBA players who currently have long-term contracts might
benefit from decertification, but free agents would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern said: "Unfair labor practice
charges, arbitration, decertification, antitrust suits don't get
it done. This ruling should have been a signal that we return to
the table today."

<HEADLINE> New Crop Strain Gives Central China Province Good Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province, a leading
grain producer in China, is expected to get 18.5 billion kg of
autumn grain this year, 3.4 percent more than in 1996, an
especially bountiful year.
</P>
<P>
The summer grain output exceeded 20 billion kg and the per
ha. yield rose to 4,800 kg, both all time highs in the
country. Local analysts attributed the good harvest to the use of
of new crop strains in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The province has tried new wheat strains seven times in the
past 50 years and the cycle between each new addition has been
shortened from 7 to 8 years to 3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
A new wheat strain developed by local agronomists years
ago has given a per-ha. wheat yield of 3,750 kg. This autumn, the
acreage sown with fine wheat strains grew to 2.6 million ha.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Continues to Increase in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors injected
more than two million U.S. dollars of capital in real terms into
businesses in the Chinese capital Beijing during the first three
quarters of this year, an increase of 18.6 percent on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Beijing Municipal Committee of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation say that the city approved 503 foreign-funded
enterprises in the nine months, with contracted foreign investment
involved grew 29.4 percent year on year to 3.19 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum is attributed to the increase of foreign
direct investment, which grew 20.4 percent year on year to 1.41
billion U.S. dollars in the nine months to September.
</P>
<P>
Over 54 percent, or 770 million U.S. dollars, of the foreign
direct investment was put into the real estate industry, which
remained the focus of foreign investment in the city.
</P>
<P>
The increased foreign investment is also attributed to
increases by well-known multinationals, which funded over 30
projects in Beijing, with combined investment reaching 950 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Castro: Agents Sent to U.S. for Terrorism Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
said in a U.S. TV interview on Tuesday that the agents Cuba sent
to the U.S. were used to gather information about terrorist
activities against the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview aired by the Cable News Network (CNN), Castro
denied the agents are spying on the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have sometimes dispatched Cuban citizens to the United
States to infiltrate counter-revolutionary organizations, to
inform us about activities that are of great interest to us,"
Castro said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have the right to do this... The United States has
spies in industrial quantities."
</P>
<P>
FBI agents last month rounded up 10 people in south Florida
accused of spying for the government in Havana.
</P>
<P>
"What information in the United States is it that interests
us? One bit of information exclusively -- one thing fundamentally
-- and that is the information about the terrorist activities
against Cuba. The information about sabotage plans," Castro said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba was not interested in "strategic matters, nor are we
interested in information about military bases," he said in
Spanish with an English interpretation.
</P>
<P>
He added that U.S. military movements in areas near Cuba would
be of interest if they "translate into an act of aggression
against Cuba. But we know that at this time that is not the
fundamental thinking of the U.S. government."

<HEADLINE> FIFA Official Praises 1999 Women's World Cup Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A FIFA's official declared
the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium is among the world's finest soccer
fields.
</P>
<P>
The stadium will be the site of six matches during the 1999
Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Per Ravn Omdal, the chairman of FIFA's organizing committee
for women's soccer, said the new stadium is even a better soccer
site than RFK Stadium, which held games during the 1994 men's
World Cup and is regarded by many world soccer officials as an
ideal facility.
</P>
<P>
Cooke Stadium is "just splendid," said Omdal, a Norwegian who
also is vice president of UEFA, Europe's soccer governing body.
</P>
<P>
Cooke Stadium, opened last year with 80,000 seats, will be the
site of four first-round games and two quarterfinal matches.
</P>
<P>
Omdal and members of the Women's World Cup organizing
committee are in the process of touring all eight of the stadiums
that will be used for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen teams will participate in the tournament, which will
involve 32 matches played as 17 events from June 19 to July 10.
All matches will be staged as doubleheaders except the
semifinals, which will be played in Foxboro, Massachusetts, and
Palo Alto, California.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament, a
figure that already exceeds the total of 112,000 tickets sold for
the 1995 World Cup in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Marla Messing, the Women's World Cup Organizing Committee
president, said the committee will break even if it sells 400,000
tickets (about 24,500 in attendance per match).
</P>
<P>
"Even with an event as large as the Olympics, the awareness
doesn't really come until very, very close to the event, and
that's when you sell most of the tickets," Messing said. "For us
to have sold 150,000 is really incredible."
</P>
<P>
Messing said capacity crowds are the goal for the opening
match on June 19 at Giants Stadium, the semifinals, the final and
games in which the United States is involved.
</P>
<P>
For other matches, however, Messing said, the goal is crowds
of 15,000 to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
All 32 matches will be nationally televised on ABC, ESPN or
ESPN2. The draw for the tournament will be held at the weekend of
February 13-14.

<HEADLINE> IBF Orders Four Heavyweights to Fight for No.1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Boxing
Federation (IBF) ordered four highly ranked heavyweight boxers to
fight in a double-box-off to determine a No. 1 mandatory
contender to champion Evander Holyfield Today.
</P>
<P>
No.2 Francois Botha of South Africa will fight No.4 John Ruiz
of the United States, while American No.3 Hasim Rahman will take
on compatriot David Tua, who ranked 12th.
</P>
<P>
The two winners then would fight for the No.1 spot, currently
vacant. Vaughn Bean held the No.1 ranking until he was beaten by
Holyfield on September 19.
</P>
<P>
"I think what the IBF is doing to make you earn the No.1 spot
is terrific and I think the other organizations should follow
suit," said Dino Duva, Tua's promoter.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good thing, and whoever arrives at No.1 will have
the necessary credulity to be No.1," said Cedric Kushner,
Rahman's promoter.

<HEADLINE> U.S., South Korea Close Auto Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and South
Korea have reached an agreement over access to the Asian country's
auto market, averting the threat of U.S. sanctions on South Korean
car imports, the United States announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement announced this evening in Washington averts the
imposition of trade sanctions," announced U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky in a statement.
</P>
<P>
This also provides "substantial opportunities for U.S.
automakers by dismantling a range of discriminatory Korean trade
barriers in the near term and by establishing a solid basis for
steady improvement in the future," Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Barshefsky said the agreement with South
Korea substantially improved on a deal signed in 1995 which U.S.
manufacturers had previously complained about.
</P>
<P>
The new deal broadened the range of cars covered by the
previous agreement to include minivans and sports utility
vehicles. It also addressed burdensome certification procedures
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, under the agreement, South Korea will also cut car
taxes substantially, bind car import tariffs to a maximum eight
percent of value, introduce a system to help Koreans finance car
purchases more easily and promise to improve the image of foreign
cars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. cited South Korea under the so-called Super
301 provisions of its trade law, which directs the administration
to identify foreign trade practices that hurt U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), which
represents Chrysler Corp., General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., charged that U.S. and other foreign car manufacturers were
being shut out of South Korea's car market.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Might Become Tyson's Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Magic Johnson, a former NBA
superstar, is likely to become Mike Tyson's manager to control
the former heavyweight champion's future career.
</P>
<P>
Johnson told the media on Monday's hearing that he would like
to be Tyson's manager.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be the closest guy to him, making all the
decisions,"Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
But sources close to Tyson said fight manager Shelly Finkel
will continue his job as Tyson's main adviser.
</P>
<P>
Johnson testified on Tyson's behalf during the hearing before
the Nevada Athletic Commission, saying he would teach Tyson how
to handle his money and his career.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I'll handle all of that for him, choose the right
team for him," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Finkel wants Tyson to fight on December 5 in Las Vegas. But
Don King, Tyson's former promoter, still holds contracts binding
Tyson to fight for him. Tyson has sued King to get out of the
contracts, but the case is far from being decided.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's advisers have been working on King in hopes of
reaching a settlement that will allow Tyson to use another
promoter. King said Monday he is happy for Tyson to get his
license back.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted Tyson will be able to fight again," said King,
whom Tyson has accused of stealing millions of dollars from him.
</P>
<P>
Tyson owes the Internal Revenue Service 13 million U.S.
dollars in back taxes, and is nearly broke despite having made
100 million dollars in purses in his last six fights.
</P>
<P>
"I have no more financial problems now," Tyson said after the
hearing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Florence Griffith Joyner,
who died last month at age of 38, was inducted into the Hall of
Fame Monday, according to a press report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who set the women's world records in the 100 m
eters and 200 meters and won three gold medals at the Seoul
Olympics in 1988, died suddenly during her sleep. The reason of
death is yet to know.
</P>
<P>
Al Joyner, Griffith Joyner's husband, wasn't the only person
in tears as he accepted on behalf of his wife.
</P>
<P>
Joyner said his wife didn't care about being known as the
world's fastest woman. "She wanted to be known as a wife, a
mother and a motivator of children."
</P>
<P>
There was also a tribute at the ceremony to two-time Olympic
gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who retired from competition
this summer. Joyner-Kersee is the late Griffith Joyner's
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan, an Olympic teammate in 1984, praised the track
and field superstar in a video presentation.
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way since 1984. You, for women, have done a
heck of a job."
</P>
<P>
At the end of video, Jordan joked: "I don't think I can outrun
you. And I don't think you can outplay me."
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee was a brilliant basketball player for her
university team. Olympic basketball gold medalist Dawn Staley
began the tribute to Joyner-Kersee. "I'm here to tell her she is
my hero," she said.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, moved by the shower of praise, said she
appreciated the show of affection during this difficult time for
her family.
</P>
<P>
"This is an honor. My heart goes out to the Women's Sports
Foundation," she said.

<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- A blueprint proposed by a group of experts from APEC
economies for attacking Asia's economic recession calls on
regional leaders to support simultaneous interest rate cuts and
budget expansion by drawing partly upon Japan's 18 billion U.S.
dollar new credit line.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Alastair Nicholson, chief justice of the Family Court,
unleashed a scathing attack on the Australian federal government
Tuesday, linking its cuts to legal aid and reluctance to appoint
more judges to rising levels of serious domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Housing Market in North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Moderately priced residential
housing in Tianjin, the biggest port city in north China, is
doing well, according to local official sources.
</P>
<P>
A record 840 million yuan (about 101 million U.S. dollars)
worth of housing, a total of 260,000 sq.m. of floor space, was sold
during a recent five-day fair.
</P>
<P>
Local people showed unprecedented enthusiasm at the
fair. Business on the opening day broke all real estate fair
records, and on the morning of the closing day, 50,000 sq.m. of
housing was sold.
</P>
<P>
A local housing official attributed the brisk business to the
country's housing policies and the support of public funds and
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
This year is an important year for reshaping the city's old
urban areas, he said. In the first eight months, the local
government allocated 3.4 billion yuan for moving people from old
urban areas and local banks provided 880 million yuan in housing
loans.
</P>
<P>
The strong housing market has helped housing-related industries
and has become a major driving force in the city's economic
growth.

<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Fiorentina, Real Sociedad,
Atletico Madrid and Olympique Lyon all enjoyed away wins in the
opening legs of the UEFA Cup second round ties on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, who lost for the first time in the Italian league
when they went down 2-1 to Roma on Sunday, bounced straight back
with a 2-0 win at Grasshoppers in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Real Sociedad allowed a three-goal lead to slip from their
grasp but still held on to win 3-2 at Dynamo Moscow, while
Olympique Lyon came from a goal behind to beat Crvena Zvezda
Belgrade 2-1 in a match switched by UEFA to neutral Bucharest in
Romania because of the tension in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Atletico Madrid also braved a difficult trip to CSKA Sofia,
winning 4-2 in Bulgaria where two of their goals came from Kiko
Narvaez -- the second coming with almost the last kick of the
game after CSKA had pulled the score back to 2-3 just two minutes
from time.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish club were reduced to 10 men in the 75th minute
when defender Santi was sent off.
</P>

Elsewhere in early action, there was a thrilling match in
Austria where Graz AK drew 3-3 with Monaco, with Graz substitute
Anton Ehmann scoring the equalizer deep into time added on for
injury.
</P>
<P>
Bologna won 2-1 at home against Slavia Prague, while fellow
Italians Parma, who won this trophy in 1995, braved a wintry
night in Poland with a 1-1 draw at Wislaw Krakow, a result that
should be enough to earn them a place in the last 16.
</P>
<P>
Club Bruges, playing in the UEFA Cup after early elimination f
rom the European Cup, fought back to draw 1-1 in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bugner Targets Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Veteran world champion Joe
Bugner has put himself in line to fight Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
World Boxing Federation title-holder Bugner first mooted the
idea of a head-to-head clash with Tyson when he beat James
Bonecrusher Smith in July to become the oldest champion ever at
the age of 48.
</P>
<P>
Following Tyson's successful re-application for a boxing
licence on Monday, Bugner has reiterated his intention to seek a
fight with the troubled former world champion.
</P>
<P>
Bugner, born in Hungary and now based in Australia after
moving from England several years ago, earned jeers rather than
plaudits after beating Smith via a second-round technical
knockout.
</P>
<P>
But he believes he is a big enough draw in his new homeland to
attract Tyson down under, according to the BBC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm able to attract enough people in this country (Australia)
to make it pay," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But what's even better is that now I'm a world champion the
fight will attract satellite coverage as well," he added.

<P>
FUZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The government of Fujian
province decided recently to tightly control the logging of
forests to protect its environment.
</P>
<P>
Loggers will need to be licensed and restrictions have been
imposed on licensing procedures. Forest station management has
been increased and cases of destruction of forests are being dealt
with forcefully, a provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
The serious flooding that hit the northern parts of Fujian in
June has been blamed on the province's serious soil erosion
problem and deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
The protection program covers forests in scenic spots and
nature reserves, near reservoirs, and in valleys near the upper
reaches of major rivers.
</P>
<P>
Loggings are limited to reafforestation areas, and natural
forests must be reafforested, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The former co-manager of
Mike Tyson has filed suit against the boxer's new adviser Shelly
Finkel, seeking a 10 percent share in any money Tyson makes from
his next five fights.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in a district court in Las
Vegas, a day following Nevada State Athletic Commission gave back
Tyson license.
</P>
<P>
John K. Horne filed the lawsuit and named Finkel as defendant.
It claims interference with contractual relations between Tyson
and Horne.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of it," Finkel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Horne, who is now a movie producer in California, said in a
statement he believes he is entitled to a multimillion-dollar
award.
</P>
<P>
Tyson broke from Horne, Rory Hollowway and Don King in March,
filing lawsuits against each. He accused King of cheating, and
his co-managers of betraying him by arranging a deal that made
King the former champion's exclusive promoter.

WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Israelis and Palestinians
Tuesday began shaping the framework of an agreement on the Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank on the sixth day of their summit
talks at the Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
With the joining of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Jordan's
King Hussein, the pace of negotiations picked up Tuesday and both
Israel and the Palestinians got down to hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that while several knotty issues
remained, Israel and the Palestinians had succeeded in reaching a
preliminary understanding on several points.
</P>
<P>
These included a second Israeli pullout from the West Bank in
12 weeks while the Palestinians confiscate illegally weapons and
jail militant terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would assume the role of verifying both the weapons
seizure and the jailings, the Associated Press (AP) quoted sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and the
Palestinian counterterrorism moves would be carried out in
parallel phases.
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinians demanded a third withdrawal from the West
Bank, the negotiators are examining an Israeli proposal that the
dispute be taken up by an Israeli-Palestinian committee with no
U.S. participation in its deliberations, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Annan: U.S. Failure to Pay Back Dues "Truly Disturbing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday issued a statement through his spokesman's
office, calling the U.S. failure to include funding for U.N.
arrears in anticipated U.S. budget agreement "truly disturbing."
</P>
<P>
"I find this outcome truly disturbing: disturbing for the
United Nations; and disturbing for the standing of the United
States in the United Nations," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a moment in history when leadership is vital. This
failure by the United States to honor its contract with the rest
of the world does not make that challenge any easier," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States needs an effective United Nations, and the
United Nations needs an engaged United States," he said.
"Therefore, we hope the (U.S.) Congress reconvenes (and) the
appropriate compromises will be struck so as to put this mutually
divisive and damaging issue behind us once and for all, enabling
us to get on with the pressing business of serving the world's
people."
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is currently on a visit to Japan, said Monday in
Florida before his departure that the United Nations becomes a
hostage of the U.S. domestic debate on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the U.S. House of Representatives will
adopt the budget agreement Tuesday night, and the Senate
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Democrats and Republicans in the U.S.
Congress reached an agreement that would have paid about one
billion U.S. dollars in arrears to the United Nations, beginning
with 475 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the funding was made conditional on a provision
barring U.S. aid to international family planning groups that
lobby countries to liberalize their abortion laws while U.S.
President Clinton said he will veto such a bill.
</P>
<P>
At present, the United States has to pay the United Nations 1.6
billion U.S. dollars in arrears, which accounts for two-thirds of
a total of U.N. outstanding dues.
</P>
<P>
Washington has to pay the United Nations 347 million U.S.
dollars before December 31 this year to avoid "the automatic loss"
of its vote in the General Assembly next year under Article 19 of
the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.N. official on Tuesday afternoon told a press
conference here that "we have good information that not a single
penny was contained in the budget bill for U.N. arrears," and "the
possibility for avoiding Article 19 next year is diminishing."

irregularities in the election process in Azerbaijan.
</P>

Rubin regretted that disagreements prevented agreement on the
composition of election commissions, which led several parties to
boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Election day itself was marred by numerous and serious voting
irregularities, including ballot stuffing, problems with the vote
count and some inappropriate conduct by the election commissions,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed particular concern over restrictions on the access
of Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
monitors to the vote counting process.

Azerbaijan rejected the interference of its domestic affairs by

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
expressed grave concern Tuesday about reports that Rwandan Hutu
extremists are now actively involved in the Congo civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the Congolese government's efforts to recruit and
train these groups and view with alarm the fact that this conflict
is strengthening the hand of the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan
genocide, " State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks at a regular briefing in the Wye
Plantation, Maryland, where the Middle East summit is being
convened.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged all sides to halt further offensive action
and pursue immediate negotiations to resolve the underlying causes
of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rebels opposed to President Laurent Kabila's government have
been making steady gains in eastern Congo since they took up arms
on August 2. Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The two countries say they have legitimate security interests
in Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid their common border
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.

<HEADLINE> GA President Urges Joint Efforts for Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
53rd General Assembly (GA) session, Didier Opertti, Tuesday called
for joint efforts for both household and national food security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting marking the World Food Day, which falls on
October 16 each year, Opertti said, "What is needed therefore is
for the the various sectors of society: governments,
parliamentarians, NGOs, the media, scientists, educators, the
private sector, women and youths organizations and all others to
coordinate their efforts to achieve a greater synergy to work
collectively towards their household and national food security."
</P>
<P>
"During these times, in particular, when the financial and
trade markets are so volatile and vulnerable, producing negative
social effects, ensuring food security for the most vulnerable in
our societies becomes an urgent imperative and a priority," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In World Food Day observance, "we are provided with an
opportunity to examine our collective conscience as a world
community and admit that the death of 30,000 people from hunger
and malnutrition each day -- is morally and socially
unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Day was observed in some 150 countries on
October 16 on the theme "Women Feed the World," stressing women's
key role in food assessment by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), which showed that 30 developing
countries are facing food emergencies, mainly due to the effect of
both El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme is truly most appropriate as women,
particularly in the developing countries, produce half of the food
grown today, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Women provide a substantial contribution through their
multiple and varied roles in agriculture, such as growing,
processing and selling food crops, raising livestocks, fishing in
lakes and rivers, and harvesting forest resources, apart from
their roles in preparing food and nurturing the family," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his October 16 message to this year's World Food Day, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "Every year, World Food Day
reminds us of a tragic reality -- that the war against hunger and
malnutrition is still being fought."
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the General Assembly called for the observance of the
World Food Day for the first time on October 16, 1981 and annually
thereafter to heighten public awareness of the problem of hunger
in the world and to encourage attention to food production.

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes WTO Appeal Report on Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada Tuesday welcomed a report
by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body confirming
that Australia's ban on imports of Canadian salmon violates
Australia's international trade obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Appellate Body upheld the conclusions of a WTO panel report
released in June 1998 that Australia's ban on imports of Canadian
fresh, chilled and frozen salmon is contrary to its obligations
under the WTO Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important decision in this long-standing dispute,"
said International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi in a release.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates, once again, the importance of the WTO dispute
settlement process in resolving trade irritants. I expect
Australia to act quickly on the Appellate Body findings and to
lift its ban on imports of Canadian salmon," added the Canadian
minister.
</P>
<P>
Australia imposed its ban on imports of Canadian salmon in
1975. After years of unsuccessful bilateral efforts to resolve the
dispute, Canada took the matter to the WTO. A WTO dispute
settlement panel was established on April 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
After the WTO Dispute Settlement Body adopts the Appellate Body
report, Australia will have 30 days to indicate how it intends to
implement the WTO findings.

<HEADLINE> 17 Killed, Two Missing in Southern U.S. Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were
killed and two others missing in Texas flooding that was triggered
by torrential rains during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The downpours that began Saturday flooded 60 counties, nearly
one-fourth of the state. More than 50 centimeters of rain were
recorded over the weekend in San Antonio, an unprecedented amount
in such a short period.
</P>
<P>
The Guadalupe River, just east of San Antonio, is usually about
45 meters across. It was about five kilometers wide in some areas
and rising Monday, forcing 1,400 people to shelters.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, the Guadalupe crested at a record 14.9 meters in
Cuero, a town of 7,000 people 150 kilometers southeast of San
Antonio, and the water was on its way south.
</P>
<P>
Frightened residents told of the river climbing three meters in
just four hours, swamping neighborhoods and forcing hundreds of
people from their homes without a chance to salvage many
belongings.
</P>
<P>
The Guadalupe is just one of many waterways swollen by weekend
rains that swamped central and southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
In DeWitt County, 1,200 people remained in shelters Tuesday
morning while emergency crews in boats floated through soaked
Cuero neighborhoods, rescuing residents.
</P>
<P>
Officials were considering evacuating about 1,300 inmates from
the Stevenson Unit prison near Cuero because of the flooding.
</P>
<P>
While houses were floating away in Cuero, up to 5,000 cattle
were roaming free in Caldwell County, northeast of San Antonio.
Thousands of animals were set loose when the flooded San Marcos
River washed away pens, barns and fencing.

<HEADLINE> Security in Kampala Under Control: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Security in Uganda's capital city
has been improved and it has been under strict control of the
police, a senior police commander told Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Namanya, the Police Supterintendent of Kampala Region
Extra, appealed to the general public to contribute to the security
of the environment in which they are living.
</P>
<P>
He talked about car robbery and theft, burglary, terrorism,
pick-pocketing and crimes by street children.
</P>
<P>
Four-wheel drive vehicles are most often the targets of car
robbers, he said, and the stolen vehicles are usually smuggled out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since September, two vehicles have been stolen and both are
recovered. More than three suspects have been arrested, he said,
adding that there are altogether 33 cars stolen so far this year and
23 of them recovered by the police.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the rest of the stolen vehicles are, I think, in the
high-walled homes," he said, "The stolen cars can be dumped in
somewhere or be still driven with fake registration numbers.
</P>
<P>
If the plate number of a car is different from its genuine number
which is often printed on the car body, the windscreen or rear mirror,
it is a suspicious car.
</P>
<P>
He also causioned people to take good care of the money they are
carrying. The loss of money is, more often than not, due to the
carelessness in carrying and keeping the money.
</P>
<P>
About 200 pick-pockets have been arrested since September, he
revealed. Four armed robbers have been killed in exchange of fire
with police in this period.
</P>
<P>
There are some cases of house burglary in Kampala, but most of
them happened in the suburbs of the city, the police officer said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the new wave of terrorism in the city, the
police commander assured that the police will do all they can to
detect and remove the potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the public should be more careful and more
cooperative with the police. If there is anything suspicious, do not
hesitate to report to the nearest police, he advised.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of street children, he said that there is no immediate
solution to the problem of street children. It is difficult to
deal with street children as far as street crimes are
concerned, Namanya added.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Regrets Over U.S. Fund Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nafis Sadik, executive
director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), on Tuesday
issued a statement, saying that the U.N. agency "deeply regrets"
the news that the United States will not include the funding for
UNFPA in appropriation for the coming financial year.
</P>
<P>
"The decision penalizes not only UNFPA but the millions of
ordinary women and men on whose behalf we work," the statement
said, "It will inevitably reduce our ability to implement vital
programs in the area of reproductive health and rights."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. decision will mean the unnecessary death and
suffering of women who are deprived of the information and means
to plan their families," the statement said, "It will deny many
people in developing countries the right that Americans take
for granted -- the right to individual freedom in regard to the
size and spacing of the family."
</P>
<P>
It will weaken not only population programs but programs aimed
at better health, equal access to health and education for women,
and economic security, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. decision will hit especially hard the least developed
countries in Africa and elsewhere whose population programs are
most dependent on external assistance," the statement said, "It
will contribute to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases,
including HIV/AIDS, which pose an even-larger threat to health,
life and prospects for development."
</P>
<P>
"It is a step backwards from United States leadership in the
population field and United States support for
internationally-agreed approaches to population problems," it said.
</P>
<P>
Falling birth and population growth rates in developing
countries demonstrate beyond question the practical validity of
promoting reproductive health and rights as ends in themselves, as
well as the means to achieve smaller family and slower population
growth, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to deny U.S. funding to UNFPA is also misguided
from the point of view of all those who, like UNFPA, wish to
promote reproductive health and rights in China," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The new UNFPA program in China, which is limited to 32
counties, was carefully designed to ensure respect for human
rights norms agreed by 180 nations at the International Conference
on Population and Development in 1994, including the vital
principle of individual decision on the size and spacing of the
family," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. funding for UNFPA is 20 million U.S. dollars in the fiscal
year 1998. The total approved by the United States for UNFPA in
the fiscal year 1988 was 25 million U.S. dollars, which was
reduced by 5 million U.S. dollars the amount expected to be spent
in China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, no U.S. funds have been available for UNFPA
expenditure in China. U.S. funding for UNFPA was suspended in 1986
when its total pledge was 46 million U.S. dollars, and was
restored by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993. UNFPA's total
resources in 1997 were 290 million U.S. dollars, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
In one year alone, the impact of the United States decision
to withdraw funding from UNFPA will be to deprive 870,000 women
of effective modern contraception. More than 520,000 will end up
not using any method.
