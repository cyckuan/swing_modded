<HEADLINE> France Urges All Zairian Leaders to Hold Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- France today called on all the
"Zairian leaders" to hold dialogue with each other in order to
"save your country" and organize free elections.
</P>
<P>
"We say to all the Zairian leaders: hold dialogue, renounce
hostilities, resume negotiations with the assistance of the
special representatives of the United Nations secretary general
and the OAU (Organization of African Unity). Save your country,
lead it to free and democratic elections. There is no other
political way," said a spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France is following "with the greatest
attention all the taking of positions by everybody, no matter
whether he is (one of) the government personalities or those of
the AFDL (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire)."
</P>
<P>
AFDL leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said Friday that France has
become "reasonable" in its attitude toward the AFDL.
</P>
<P>
"It (France) is no more what it was at the beginning. It
becomes reasonable. There is less aggressiveness toward us," said
Kabila in an interview with the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko today rejected
the ultimatum by Kabila asking him to talk with the rebels within
three days, but said that he would negotiate with the latter if he
"asks for it politely."
</P>
<P>
"I am a chief of state. I am not to receive ultimatum from the
chiefs of bands," said Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
He said that he "cannot refuse to talk to a Zairian compatriot"
if he asks for it politely.
</P>
<P>
"But being in Goma (eastern Zaire) and say that I give three
days if he does not answer, this is not my style. It is not in my
nature and I cannot answer.... If they say, Mr. President of the
Republic of Zaire, my intention is to meet you, this is polite,"
said Mobutu.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament has
lately narrowly approved a report criticizing the European Union's
human rights record, with the legislature's leftist and righting
parties squaring off over individual liberties.
</P>
<P>
The parliament approved the document presented by its Committee
on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs by a vote of 174 to 166,
with 66 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The report offered a broad range of issues to be included under
the umbrella of human rights -- opposition to euthanasia, the
right to a clean environment, and the need to safeguard personal
information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Among the alleged human rights deficiencies cited are the use
of euthanasia in the Netherlands, the export of arms by Germany to
Turkey, and the imprisonment by Greece of conscientious objectors
to military service.

<HEADLINE> Chang Faces Rafter in Hong Kong Open Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Michael Chang beat
Sweden's fourth seed Thomas Johansson in the semi-finals, and the
Chinese-American is only one step away from his third title at
the Salem Open Tennis tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, winner of the Hong Kong Open in 1994 and 1995 and
runner-up to Pete Sampras last year, outplayed Johansson 7-6
(7-5), 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Chang will meet Australia's fifth-seeded Patrick Rafter in a
repeat of the 1994 final. Rafter won the semi-final match after
308th-ranked American qualifier Brian MacPhie was forced to retire
with an upper arm injury when trailing 3-6, 6-1, 3-0 in the other
semifinal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"In the first set we both struggled on our first serve but
after that I settled down and served a lot better," said Chang,
who is local fans' hero.
</P>
<P>
"I am excited to be in the final in Hong Kong where I have such
dedicated fans," he continued.
</P>
<P>
But he is not optimistic of the final slated for Sunday
afternoon. "It will be a tough game," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Rafter was more worried of about he would make the same mistake
as on the eve of the 1994 final. He had some seafood before the
title match and then suffered from food poisoning during the
match.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM to Tout Big Projects on Asian Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
Ganzouri said today that he will embark on a 10-day tour of
Singapore, Malaysia and China Sunday in a bid to attract
investment for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri today reviewed the projects Egypt wants to establish
in cooperation with the three booming economies in the Far East at
an intensive pre-departure meeting with his delegation, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian side will present a number of joint ventures for
the development of southern Egypt and implementing infrastructure
of giant national projects, including setting up a free industrial
and trade zone in the Suez Canal area, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will also brief their Asian counterparts on
the investment opportunities in various areas in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also presented to President Hosni Mubarak the
agreements to be signed during the trip, four with Malaysia, and
five with Singapore and China.
</P>
<P>
The agreements provide for protection of investments,
prevention of dual taxation, activation of trade movement and
implementation of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he expects Egypt to set up six joint projects
with Singapore in various fields and form a free trade zone east
of Suez Canal with Malaysia, he added.
</P>
<P>
For days, local press has shed spotlight on the tour, which
acquires special importance as the first ever visit by an Egyptian
prime minister to those countries since 1964.
</P>
<P>
Egypt attaches extra interest to the tour also because of its
keenness to link its economy with that of other states that enjoy
high growth rates to benefit from their experiments, said MENA.
</P>
<P>
Thus his talks in these countries will focus on available
investment opportunities as well as ways to enhance Egypt's
relations with them.
</P>
<P>
Talks in Malaysia, a member of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN), will dwell on ways to encourage investment
in Egypt and improve trade balance between the two countries
tilting in favor of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, Ganzouri will explore ways to increase trade
exchange which stood at about 211 million U.S. dollars during
the first 10 months last year.
</P>
<P>
In China, the prime minister will seek opportunities on joint
projects on energy, industry and investment, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level
delegation grouping the ministers of electricity, trade, industry,
local administration and cabinet affairs along with a team of
investors and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan Ready for Disbursement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The 63.6-million-U.S.-Dollar
World Bank loan facility for Zimbabwe's small-and-medium scale
businesses will be released next week, a deputy minister said
today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Obert Mpofu said
eight financial institutions have now been designated to disburse
the funds under the enterprise development facility.
</P>
<P>
The loan facility was a result of a development credit
agreement negotiated between the government and the International
Development Association (IDA), he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the IDA lent Zimbabwe the loan at a
standard variable interest rate of 0.75 percent with a maturity
of forty years, including ten years grace period.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to support a more broad based but rapid
growth of the private sector including enterprises whose growth
is contingent on direct or indirect expansion of non-traditional
exports.
</P>
<P>
"Under the facility, the maximum amount that enterprises can
borrow is the equivalent of 75,000 U.S. Dollars," said Mpofu.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Foreign Minister to Visit Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Yiannakis Cassoulides will visit Athens next week for talks with
the Greek leaders on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Greek Deputy Foreign Minister
Yiannos Kranidiotis, who is on a four-day working visit here,
after a meeting with Cassoulides who replaced Alecos Michaelides
in last Monday's cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis told reporters that he discussed with the Cypriot
Foreign Minister on Cyprus prospects for accession to the
European Union and the ongoing U.N.-sponsored proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the next two to three years will be
crucial to the Cyprus problem in relation to the island's EU
accession course.
</P>
<P>
"We don't foresee an easy road, there will be difficulties,
but I believe that there will also be opportunities," the
Greek official said, stressing that those opportunities must be
taken advantage of through a long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis also said a Cyprus solution must be based on
the 1977 and 1979 High Level Agreements the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides have signed, and relevant U.N. Security Council
Resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The High Level Agreements provide for a bizonal, bicommunal
federation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Friday, the Greek official has expressed his support to the
ongoing U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides, and hoped that the talks will be fruitful and
lead to direct talks between the two community leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the 37 percent of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> PNA Demands Israel Halt Judaization of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today warned of grave consequences if Israel does
not change its policy of Judaization in Jerusalem, the state-run
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, which issued the warning in a statement at the end of
its weekly cabinet session in Gaza, also demanded that the
hardline Netanyahu government stop settlement expansion in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNA stated that it is committed to the peace
process despite current problems with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA also paid tribute to Palestinian protesters who
had clashed with Israeli troops almost on the daily basis for
the past three weeks in various autonomous cities.
</P>
<P>
In another development, according to a report from Washington,
PLO Secretary General Abu Mazen, accompanied by PNA ministers Saeb
Erekat and Hanan Ashrawi, held talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross
on how to get the derailed peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
But there is no sign indicating that Albright is planning a
visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiators demanded that Israel give back to
Palestinians more territories in the first phase of the withdrawal
from the West Bank following the Hebron agreement, which was
signed in January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fresh street battle between rock-throwing
Palestinian youths and well-armed Israeli army soldiers broke out
again in Hebron today. Hundreds of Palestinian youths confronted
the soldiers with a barrage of rocks.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers responded with rubber bullets and tear gas,
injuring five stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police intervened, but failed to control the
demonstrators. Several youths took up positions on rooftops and
dropped rocks on the Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron violence has already continued for five consecutive
days.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Decides to Punish Iran in Non-US Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- European governments today began
the formal recall of ambassadors from Iran but showed that Europe
was not following the footsteps of the United States to isolate
the Islamic nation diplomatically and economically.
</P>
<P>
The fact that France has turned down the possibility of
economic sanctions on Tehran, indicated that the 15-nation
European Union was unlikely to go beyond the suspension of its
so-called critical dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington has been easily satisfied by the EU's
positive response to a German court ruling that Iran engaged in
state-run terrorism by slaying three Kurdish dissidents and their
translator in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 protestors, who have been angered by the ruling,
marched on the Germany embassy in Tehran, shouting slogans like
"Death to Germany" and "Fascist Germany" and throwing tomatoes at
the embassy residence.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said that what has
happened, including the European action and the German ruling, was
something instigated by the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic president said that European ambassadors would
return to Iran soon since they did the same after protesting the
death edict against Salman Rushdie, the British author, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Another reason Rafsanjani cited was the fact that Iran was a
stronger economy than eight years ago, which meant that its
economic charm could be used to balance the pressure from foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
While Tehran is condemning the German court ruling, Washington
hailed it as a recognition of U.S. charges that Iran sponsors
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael MuCurry said, "The European Union
and the German government responded appropriately to that court
decision." The U.S. would continue close consultations with the EU
about any "reprehensible" activity by Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, however, vowed to enhance
cooperation with Iran at a meeting in Moscow with the leader of
the Iranian Parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Gennadi Seleznyov, leader of the Communists in the Russian
Parliament, also expressed his sympathy with Iran, saying, "No
court in this world has the authority to pass sentence on a whole
country."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that this different reaction from Moscow has shown
its determination to seek allies to support its opposition to the
planned expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the policy makers of EU nations are also no fools. They
know clearly that any commercial and diplomatic gap, which will be
left by any of the steps they are possibly going to take, will be
filled immediately by some of their eager neighbors.
</P>
<P>
And Iran, a country with a population of 65 million and rich
natural resources such as oil and gas, is not a geopolitical unit
which can be so easily ignored, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rummelhardt, a spokesman for the French Foreign
Ministry, said that France would oppose any attempt to impose
economic sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He explained that economic sanctions were not an "appropriate"
solution to the issue in question.
</P>
<P>
Greece went even further by saying that it did not see the
necessity of recalling its ambassador.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, European oil companies said that they would
not withdraw their new investments in Iran.
</P>
<P>
But a senior EU official said that some sanctions, possibly
including a ban on visas for Iranian officials and restrictions on
loans to Tehran, would be among the options put to EU foreign
ministers when they meet on April 19 in Luxembourg.

The "social justice" march, which was aimed at highlighting

schemes and the use of cars, and groups of unemployed, disabled
and asylum seekers were also among those demonstrators.

<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Congolese President Pascal
Lissouba went to Kinshasa this afternoon to meet Zairian President
Mobutu Sese Seko on the Zaire crisis, said officials of the
Congolese presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Lissouba will try to persuade President
Mobutu to meet the chief of the Zairian rebellion, Laurentg-Desire
Kabila, in the Congolese city of Pointe Noire, as was suggested by
Lissouba earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the Customs and Economic Union of central African
countries held this week in Brazzaville encouraged Lissouba, who
is president of the Consultative Committee on African Security of
the United Nations, to mediate between Mobutu and Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Zairian Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda will also
visit Brazzaville Sunday to meet Congolese officials on the crisis

<HEADLINE> Egypt Builds First Nuclear Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's first nuclear reactor,
which will begin operation at the end of 1997, is already under
construction, according to the latest issue of Al Ahram weekly.
</P>
<P>
The 22-megawatt reactor, to be used for peaceful purposes, is
being built in Argentina and will be installed in Inshass,
northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt imported two mini-reactors, two megawatts each, in the
1960s, it said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the reactor will cost 350 million Egyptian
pounds (about 103 million U.S. dollars), with an additional 100
million pounds (29.4 million dollars) on purchasing a cyclotron to
produce radioactive isotopes.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza said that the
reactor would be used for "peaceful research in the fields of
agriculture, industry and medicine."
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
another treaty banning nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Angolan People Hail Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- From the western coastal cities
to the eastern remote areas, festivals have been staged by
Angolans to hail peace dawning on the war-torn southern African
country at last.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
(PMLA) and the former rebel movement, the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), joined hands to form a
government of national unity and reconciliation on Friday, a
development that marked a major victory in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In capital Luanda, a grand ceremony was held to mark the
swearing in of the unity government, attended by officials of the
newly-established governments, 13 foreign heads of state,
delegates of foreign governments, foreign envoys as well as tens
of thousands of Luandan citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local residents weary of war took to the major
streets leading to the city center where a parade of cars,
motors, bicycles was staged to hail the delayed peace.
</P>
<P>
In Kuito, capital of the central war-ravaged Bie Province,
local citizens started their procession in early morning, holding
placards and slogans reading "We want peace", "Rebuild Angola".
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in this country know better the misery of war and the
happiness of peace than we do," said a woman taking part in the
parade.
</P>
<P>
They still remember that at the end of 1992 when war broke out
again in Angola, about 50,000 people were killed in a single
fighting between the government troops and the former UNITA
rebels in Kuito. And the city itself was ravaged.
</P>
<P>
"The shadow of war is still haunting everybody who survives,"
said a local resident.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Huila Province, the central Kuanza-Norte
Province, the southwestern Cunene Province and the northeastern
Lunda-Sul Province, all kinds of festivities were held to
welcome a new stage of peaceful life.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old civil war, starting from 1975, killed at least
one million people, produced three million war refugees and
deprived 100,000 children of their parents.
</P>
<P>
The national economy was savagely ravaged with direct
financial loss reaching nearly 30 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
But now, with the establishment of the unity government,
despite many difficulties lying ahead, the Angolan people will
surely rebuild a new, prosperous Angola as they march toward a
lasting peace.

PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan Interior Minister Driss
Hasri today described France's long processing of visa application
by Moroccans as "unacceptable," and said that he had raised the
issue with President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse quoted Hasri as saying today in Paris
that France's crackdown on illegal immigrants has "touched the
base" of regular immigration and normal circulation of people to
France.
</P>
<P>
"This is a question of principle and national dignity. We will
not accept such red tape," Hasri said, adding that "France would
be the loser" if it did not change its policy of visa processing.
</P>
<P>
He said that Moroccan businessmen can go to Germany, the United
States and Britain without having to wait for two months for their
visas as they do for going to France.
</P>
<P>
France and Morocco will set up a joint committee to study the
problem, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Blasts Israel's Refusal of EU Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today blasted Israel's refusal of a new European initiative
to resume the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The European logic include positive ideas and for this the
Israeli Prime Minister turned them down," he told reporters,
countering Binyamin Netanyahu's charge that the European Union is
biased toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli refusal is part of the negative stance," he said,
warning that the peace process will be ruined if Israel goes on
with its current policy.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting reports that 90 percent of the EU initiative on the
peace process are U.S. ideas, Moussa said they are "European
ones" and urged a more active European role.
</P>
<P>
He said the Europeans should work with the U.S. and other
parties in order to protect the peace process, which came to a
halt last month since Israel began to build a new Jewish
settlement on the edge of Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As the EU stepped up pressure for a greater say in the Mideast
peace-making, Netanyahu said the U.S. should be the center of
facilitating talks, warning that "too many cooks spoil the broth."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, currently on a four-day visit to the Netherlands
and Italy, has demanded the 15-nation bloc to create a "more
even-handed policy" and "more realistic expectations" about its
role to gap the differences between Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the Israeli leader, however, the Egyptian top
diplomat said the initiative is not perfect but it was clear that
the Europeans have thoroughly discussed the issue of settlement
and confidence re-building.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the European initiative does not reflect the Arab
stance. In the Arab logic, we will find that it needs some
amendments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt will take some diplomatic steps to protect
the peace drive and bring it back on track, based on the
land-for-peace principle and the need to halt settlements and
safeguard Jerusalem, a holy city to Muslims, Christians and Jews.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stops Buying Meat, Butter, Wool from New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government announced
here today that it has decided to stop purchasing meat, butter
and wool from New Zealand due to Wellington's negative diplomatic
move.
</P>
<P>
Gholamreza Forouzesh, Minister of Construction Jihad said "Iran
had suspended Iran-New Zealand impending agreements for purchasing
meat, butter and wool."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the measure has been in
response to New Zealand's recalling of its ambassador from
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is now looking for alternative suppliers elsewhere," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Iran seems to take tough line in
dealing with non-EU member states. The move will certainly
affect its relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
All EU member states, except Greece, have decided to recall
their ambassadors from Tehran because of the alleged involvement of
Iranian leadership in a murder case in Germany in
1992. Ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and France have left from
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Other EU ambassadors are expected to leave from Tehran within
a week or 10 days, a western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Berlin court ruled that the top political
leadership in Iran was behind the assassination of Kurdish
opposition leaders in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The court gave life imprisonment to one Iranian national
and a Lebanese and sentenced two other Lebanese to long prison
terms on charge of assassinating the four Kurdish dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government rejected the ruling by the Berlin
court and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani Friday blasted out
at the Berlin court ruling, terming the court "sinister" and
"disgraceful".
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president attacked Germany for "destroying
100-year friendship" with Iran because of baseless verdict by
the Berlin court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 800 Iranians staged an anti-German demonstrations in
front of German Embassy Friday afternoon in protest against the
verdict by the Berlin court.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators vowed to launch a suicide attack on the
mission if Bonn continues "hostile" policies against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, Iran will launch a nationwide anti-German
demonstrations. Millions of Iranians and hundreds of political
groupings throughout the country are expected to join the protest
rally to denounce the verdict of the Berlin court on the Mykonos
case.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Questions Switzerland for Maltreatment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian mission in Geneva has
demanded an explanation from the Swiss government of the
maltreatment of Clement Nwankwo, a Nigerian citizen.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria said in a report today that
Nigeria's permanent representative to the United Nations in
Geneva, Ejoh Abuah, has delivered a strongly-worded letter to the
Swiss government on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Nwankwo is a Nigerian human right activist who attended the
53rd session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It continued that Nwankwo was accused of shoplifting and
suffered "four days of humiliation, degradation, torture and
punishment" before his conviction.
</P>
<P>
Nwankwo himself claimed that during his arrest, he was hit in
the face by one of the policemen and his glasses were smashed
while one of the policemen "put his baton on my neck and squeezed
real hard."
</P>
<P>
He was swiftly deported after his conviction by the court, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian mission lamented that Nwankwo was deported even
while the appeal for his conviction was still pending and without
contacting it, a move which they said was contrary to diplomatic
practice.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the session of the Human Rights Commission
have expressed their shock at the occurrence of such an event in
a city housing the U.N. human rights center, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They were also quoted as saying that similar cases had
happened in the past, especially against colored people.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that his country is eager to mediate an end to
the armed conflicts in Somali.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is keen on efforts to achieve reconciliation among the
warring factions," said Moussa on the eve of his meeting with
Hussein Farah Aideed, leader of the most powerful militia in the
southern half of the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The Somali leaders are aware of the grave consequences that can
ensue if the situation remained as it is, Moussa said in press
statements.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been making efforts within the framework of Arab
and African mediation to put an end to the crisis in Somalia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's mediation will complement that of other "sister
countries" like Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and the Arab League and
the Organization of the Islamic Countries.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of Mogadishu's
northern part, came here to meet Egyptian officials mediating in
the six-year Somali conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late president Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Recall Ambassadors from European Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government announced
here today that it will recall its ambassadors as a tit-for-tat
measure against European countries in the wake of the Berlin court
verdict.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that the move was meant to
reciprocate the decision of the European governments concerned to
recall their ambassadors from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Netherlands,
now rotary head of the European Union (EU), said Saturday that EU
members had recalled their ambassadors from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
But, the report said, Italy and Greece, both EU members,
said Saturday that their ambassadors are still in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the recalling of ambassadors means a
big backtrack in Iran's relations with EU countries though they
do not officially downgrade their diplomatic ties from ambassador
level to the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin verdict will also greatly affect economic and
trade relations between Iran and EU member states, which take
a share of 41.3 percent of Iran's total imports and 32.8
percent of its total export.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that both sides do not want to break their
relations, with economic and trade links in particular.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided to recall their ambassadors after the Berlin
court verdict which ruled that the top political leadership in
Iran were behind the assassination of four opposition leaders
in a Berlin restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in its declaration that it condemns the
involvement of the Iranian authorities and regards such behavior
as totally unacceptable international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The EU also decided to suspend the critical dialogue with
the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
All EU member states, except Greece and Italy, have decided
to recall their ambassadors from Tehran. Ambassadors from Germany,
Sweden and France have left from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Other ambassadors are expected to leave Tehran within a week
or 10 days, a western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammoud Mohammadi, spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry,
Friday described as "unprincipled" the stance of the EU president.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the stance is based on unfounded
remarks of the Berlin court verdict and pressure exerted by
those who want to strain Iran-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
He rejected connecting Iran, a country which itself has been a
victim of terrorist acts, with acts of terrorism by some countries
which on occasions have provided safe sanctuary for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran respects international laws and
regulations in its foreign policy and does not allow the
critical dialogue with EU to be used a pressure lever against
Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Based on its principled policy and goodwill, Iran has
welcomed the critical dialogue with EU in the past years with the
aim that both sides could openly raise their criticism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, Iran has always been a witness to biased
provocations and sabotage of some of the members," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Germany have recalled their ambassadors from each
other's capitals. Each of the two has also expelled four diplomats
of the other from its capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the two
sides reviewed current developments in Afghanistan and Velayati
stressed the urgency for finding peaceful solutions to the
Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that Iran had always been
concerned about the situation in Muslim Afghanistan and that
it had done what it could to return peace to the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar appreciated the logical position of Iran in
relation to Afghanistan as well as its humanitarian assistance
to his country.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the warlike policies of the Taliban regime in
Kabul which were, as he said, against the best interests of the
people of that country.
</P>
<P>
He said the solution to the internal Afghan problems lies
in dialogue between all rival groups and their sincere
collaboration for returning peace to that country.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar also condemned the instigation of foreign powers
and especially that of the United States and said that foreign
powers should evacuate Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Iran offered 1,750 tonnes of humanitarian
assistance to the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The food consignment would be distributed among people in
the northern and central parts of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
That was the third consignment of the Iranian assistance.
The previous two consignments included 1,900 tonnes of flour along
with other food essentials which were also distributed among
people in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The people of these two regions are Muslims of shiite and
Sunni sects sympathetic to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran declared earlier that it would continue to provide
"humanitarian aid" to Afghanistan since it still recognizes ousted
Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani as the legitimate
representative of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati denied any
military assistance to the factions against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He even called on some countries in the region to stop
any shipment of arms and military equipment to the Taleban
while condemning foreign intervention in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the deposed government, which allied
with the faction of northern Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostam
after losing Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Targets Economic Growth at 6.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has cherished an aim to boost
its economic growth to 6.2 percent for the fiscal year 1997-98
from 5.7 percent in the previous fiscal year, the Egyptian Gazette
reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Ministerial Economic Group Saturday,
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri laid out the blueprint
for the nation and called for extensive efforts to attract huge
investments for the fiscal 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
"The targeted economic growth rate will be 6.2 percent," said
Ganzouri after he presented the Cabinet-proposed annual budget to
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget will be submitted to the People's Assembly for
discussion before May.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said he expected that 58 billion Egyptian pounds
(about 17 billion U.S. dollars) will be invested in Egypt during
the first year to help reduce the level of unemployment through
creating more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the sum will come from the private sector,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the prime minister pointed out that there would be no
new duties or burdens to be levied in 1997-98, as the government
declared before. Thus, the ratio of tax to the gross national
income will fall to 17 percent from 18 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt plans to scale up the volume of its general budget for
the coming fiscal year to 84 billion pounds (24.71 billion
dollars) from 77.5 billion (22.79 billion dollars) last year, a
hike of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
To give social services a better care, special expenditure
would rise from 25 percent of the general expenditure last year to
26 percent in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The budget will secure the natural increase in salaries, take
care of current expenditure for replacement and maintenance to
improve the quality of services, especially in the domains of
education and health.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a landmark blueprint for Egypt's future
development over the next 20 years details plans to speed up the
economic development to achieve an annual growth rate of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Achieving the goals will require 100 billion pounds (about 34
billion dollars) in annual investments over the next 20 years, and
the private sector is planned to shoulder 75 to 80 percent
of the costs for all projects.

<HEADLINE> Zairian Rebels Capture Two More Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebels of Laurent-Desire
Kabila today captured Kananga, the capital of the Western Kasai
region in south-central Zaire, days after they took Lubumbashi,
the second largest city and "economic lung" of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The rebels today also took Kolwezi, a city in the region of
Shaba in southern Zaire, said official sources in the Zairian
capital.
</P>
<P>
Zairian government troops usually looted the city they would
abandon and flee without a fight. Only in Lubumbashi did the
rebels meet stiff resistance from the elite Special Presidential
Division of the Zairian army.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel leader Kabila indicated today that he
would "travel very soon, probably to South Africa to dynamize"
the peace negotiation with the Zairian government.
</P>
<P>
"He will travel to have very important meetings," said the
"foreign minister" of the rebels, Bizima Karaha, in Goma in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said that if necessary, Kabila would meet with President
Mobutu Sese Seko, although to force Mobutu to step down remains
the ultimate goal of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The "foreign minister" also reaffirmed rebels' position of
"Never a ceasefire before talks."
</P>
<P>
In another development, Zairian Vice Minister of the Interior,
Lumuna NDubu today announced that troops will be deployed in the
streets of Kinshasa on Monday to foil an attempt by the radical
opposition to stage a "dead city" day.
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers will be deployed in the streets to ensure the
security of the people," said Lumuna on television.
</P>
<P>
He justified the measure by citing the state of emergency
declared by President Mobutu last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of the government toward the organizers of this
day is negative," said the vice minister, saying that the strike
would not "benefit the people who need to live day from day."
</P>
<P>
The Union for the Democracy and Social Progress, led by Etienne
Tshisekedi who was sacked by Mobutu one week after being nominated
prime minister, launched an appeal for "dead city" and "dead
country" day on Monday to pressure Mobutu to resign.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iraq Sign 2 Medicine Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today concluded two accords
with Iraq on supplying the sanctions-stricken country with more
much-needed medicines in accordance with the U.N. oil-for-food
plan, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreements signed by the Iraqi Health Ministry and the
Egyptian International Company for Pharmaceutical Industries, will
be referred to the U.N. Sanctions Committee for ratification in the
next couple of days, said the Egyptian Trade Center in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agreements came exactly a week after Egypt kicked off a
Medicine Week in Baghdad to cash in on Iraq's dire need for
medicine after six years of suffering under the international
embargo imposed for its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The exhibited drugs from 20 Egyptian firms will be later
offered to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in late January, Egypt will export 3
million U.S. dollars of medicines to Iraq. The first batch of the
medicine has already reached Iraq in late February.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects the volume of exports to Iraq to reach 100
million dollars in the first six months of the implementation of
the oil-for-food deal concluded by the U.N. and Iraq last year to
ease the impact of the trade sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today was urged by 15 members of parliament to
re-examine the relations between Bonn and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest response from the parliament after
Thursday's verdict of the Berlin court charging top Iranian
leaders with ordering the 1992 killing of four Kurdish
opposition leaders in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Iranian
parliament held closed session this morning to review the court
ruling and statements by the prosecutor of the Berlin court
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The session was held in the presence of Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati. The members of the Foreign Policy Commission of
the Parliament will also meet shortly to discuss and debate the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Anti-German demonstrations took place here today with tens of
thousands of people turning out to protest the Berlin court
verdict. Similar demonstrations were held in 10 other Iranian
cities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators urged the Iranian government to sever
diplomatic relations and economic ties between Bonn and Tehran,
and to prosecute German firms which provide chemical weapons to
Iraq in the Iranian-Iraqi war between 1980-1988.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour demonstrations in the downtown here sparked the
maximum tensions in the ties between Tehran and Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Germany have already recalled their ambassadors from
each capital and expelled four diplomats from the each side
shortly after the verdict was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin verdict may also affect economic and trade relations
between Iran and member states of the European Union, which take
a share of 41.3 percent of Iran's total imports and 32.8 percent
of the total export.

<HEADLINE> Ross Due Back to Mideast on Trouble-Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is
due back to the Middle East at end of the week on another
trouble-shooting mission aimed at breaking the impasse in the
Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The message of Ross' return was conveyed today to Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy by U.S. Ambassador to Tel Aviv
Martin Indyk, the Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
This will be Ross' second trip to the region in several weeks
since the Israeli-Palestinian peace process grounded to a halt
due to Israel's start of building the controversial Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem and the March 21 suicide bombing in
Tel Aviv that killed three Israeli women.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Ross traveled to Morocco to hold talks with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
before heading for Israel to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu. But he returned empty-handed after failing
to bridge the big gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Following Ross' previous trip, U.S. President Bill Clinton
invited Netanyahu to Washington early in the month in an attempt
to press him to make concessions in order to resume the peace
process. But the meeting produced no tangible results as
Netanyahu insisted on his tough stand.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
met with visiting Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat,
Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and PNA Minister of
Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi to learn the Palestinian position
on resuming the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said that the Clinton administration
was formulating a plan of action as what to do next to get the
Israeli-Palestinian peace march back on track following intensive
consultations with both sides.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Albright herself will also visit the
region soon following Ross's mission so as to solve the deepening
crisis in the deadlocked process.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point in bring the Israelis and Palestinians
back to talks again is that both sides have marked their own red
line on resuming the talks. Israel conditions the resumption of
talks on the PNA's commitment to launching a long-term crackdown
on Palestinian extremist militant groups, while the PNA insists
on Israel's freezing the construction of settlements in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> More Young People Prefer Study to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese young people become
students than employees as they began to realize the importance of
education in an increasingly competitive society.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics released by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB)
showed that the employment rate among people aged between 15 and
24 decreased to 65.2 percent in 1996 from 81.26 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more people from the same age group attended various
schools for further training. The rate for those who became
students increased to 20.5 percent last year from 14.65 percent in
1982.
</P>
<P>
SSB analysis said that China's rapid economic growth brought
the focus of market competition to personnel. The quality of labor
forces, especially their educational background, has become a
bigger factor for job hunters.
</P>
<P>
The dropped employment rate for young people showed that
Chinese youth who have been aware of the competition are looking
forward to improving their marketability.
</P>
<P>
Rural young people seemed to be more sensitive about the
change. The rate of rural youth going to school increased by 3.77
percentage points in 1995 compared to 1990 while the rate grew by
1.5 percentage points for urban youth.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Nation-wide Anti-German Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched a nationwide
anti-German demonstrations to protest the Berlin court verdict
charging Iranian top leaders of involvement in murdering Kurdish
opposition leaders in Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Demonstrators turning out in the capital
urged the Iranian government to sever diplomatic relations and
economic ties between Bonn and Tehran, to prosecute German firms
which provide chemical weapons to Iraq during the war with Iran
between 1980 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour demonstrations in in front of the German embassy
and streets in the down town sparked the maximum tensions in the
ties between Tehran and Bonn while the Iranian Parliament was
examining the latest situation in close door session.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the Berlin court verdict on
Thursday, Iran and Germany have already recalled their
ambassadors and kicked out four diplomats from the each side.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the rally were clergymen, students, government
employees, merchants, soldiers and politicians. However, some
people said that they were asked to leave the office and came for
the anti-German demonstrations in front the German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Holding large pictures of chemical weapon victims and big
portraits of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, demonstrators chanted slogans "Down
with Fascist Germany", "Down with USA" and "Down with Israel".
</P>
<P>
While condemning the verdict of the Berlin court,
demonstrators also shouted slogans "the Mykonos trial is
U.S. Plot", "Verdict is disgrace for Westerners,
especially Germans", "German firms must be prosecuted in Iran".
</P>
<P>
There was a heavy police presence in streets nearby and along
the route where the protesters were moving. The police had to cut
off the main street in front the German Embassy, which remained
closed with heavy curtain on the windows.
</P>
<P>
The embassy was under tight security with about 800 anti-riot
policemen stationed in front of the building.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous policeman told Xinhua that anti-riot policemen
were ordered to maintain the security in front of the embassy in
case of any violence.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see again what happened to the U.S. embassy
18 years ago," the policemen said, referring to the taken-over of
the U.S. embassy by Iranian students right after the Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Reza Akrami, member of Parliament Board of Directors and the
Parliament Foreign Relations Committee, made a long speech,
condemning the Berlin court ruling, claiming that the verdict has
no legal value.
</P>
<P>
A resolution was issued at the end of the demonstration,
calling on the government to firmly and resolutely react to the
German government and all other countries which pursue the
anti-Iran policy.
</P>
<P>
Some university students termed the Berlin court's proceedings
as a pre-meditated scenario designed directly by the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rahman Housseini, a law student at the Tehran University, said
the proceedings of the German court was a political one rather
than judicial.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were also held in other ten cities in
Iran, including Arak, Qom, Tabriz, Ardabil and Shahr Kord.

<HEADLINE> Ancient City Builds Modern Transport Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Quanzhou, an ancient trade hub in
east China's Fujian province, has given priority to building
modern transport facilities as the foundation for its development.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou was one of the largest ports in the world back in the
Song and Yuan dynasties (10th to 14th centuries).
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Quanzhou has expanded the handling capacity
of its port to 13 million tons each year and opened ocean shipping
lines to more than 20 countries and regions. Last year, the
Quanzhou port handled eight million tons of cargos, ranking 18th
in China.
</P>
<P>
The city has invested more than two billion yuan in building
and upgrading nearly 1,000 km of highways over the past four
years, and an expressway connecting Quanzhou with Xiamen, another
major port in the area, will open to traffic in the coming
September.
</P>
<P>
It has renovated the former military Jinjiang airport to
accommodate large and medium-sized passenger planes. Since the
renovated airport opened at the end of last year, the number of
air routes between Quanzhou and other cities has increased from
five to 11, with 48 flights each week.
</P>
<P>
The airport has so far handled more than 50,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou is also building its first railway, connecting
Zhangping in western Fujian to Xiaoxi in Quanzhou. Some 127 km of
tracks have been laid. The railway is scheduled to go into
operation within the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Antonio Pinto chalked
up the men's title with a new course record at the London Marathon
race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old fomer professional cyclist, title-winner in
1992, crossed the finish-line with a time of two hours seven
minutes and 55 seconds, also his personal best.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Stefano Baldini came second with 2:07:57.3, followed by
Olympic champion Josiah Thugwane of South Africa in 2:08:06.4.
</P>
<P>
In the women's sections, Briton Liz McColgan's bid to win a
second successive London Marathon was dashed by her closest rival
Kenyan Joyce Chepchumba in the final 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion McColgan, 32, took the lead from the
beginning and seemed she could repeat last year's triumph, but
Chepchumba produced a surprising late spurt to just edge in front
by clocking two hours 26 minutes and 51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba has changed the clash record against McColgan. The
Kenyan had to settle for the second behind McColgan 12 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
McColgan and Lidia Simon of Romania finished second and third
here with 2:26:52.3 and 2:27:11.4 respectively.

JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli security guards
were shot and lightly wounded today at the Allenby Bridge
(Hussein Bridge) between Israel and Jordan, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
A woman, apparently having gone through Jordanian security
checks, crossed the bridge, and suddenly opened fire as she
approached the security guards, said the report. But the radio
neither identified the attacker nor gave other details on the
shooting.

<P>
Earlier last month, seven Israeli schoolgirls were killed
and six others wounded, when a crazy Jordanian soldier shot them
to death as they toured the Jordanian-controlled Naharayim
enclave at the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
Later King Hussein of Jordan paid a condolence visit to
Israel, going house to house to visit the bereaved families of
the seven victims, pledging to push forward the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Top legislator Stresses Efforts against separatism in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China must take a resolute stand
against national separatism by religious extremists in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Chinese top legislator Qiao Shi
stated here today.
</P>
<P>
"We must firmly oppose national separatism and religious
extremist forces, and safeguard the dignity of laws and the
fundamental interests of people of various ethnic groups," Qiao
Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said in a meeting with the region's senior Party,
government and military leaders this morning.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made a
stopover in Urumqi on his way to Mongolia after visiting several
European countries.
</P>
<P>
"Opposing religious extremist forces has been the common action
taken by the majority of the countries in the world, including
some Western countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We must always guard against and strike hard at activities to
split the unification of the motherland and undermine unity among
people of various ethnic groups," he said, "it will be our
top priority work at present and a task for a long time to come."
</P>
<P>
"As a region inhabited by 47 different ethnic groups, Xinjiang
must take effective measures to strengthen the unity among people
of various ethnic groups," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We must always bear in mind the idea that 'Han people can not
live without the ethnic minorities and the ethnic minorities
cannot live without the Han people'," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be given to the legitimate special interests
of ethnic minority people, so that people of ethnic groups will
improve their living standards substantially, and make new
achievements in their social undertakings and cultural progress,"
he told local officials.

"Rich in natural resources, Xinjiang enjoys a very good
prospect for economic development," he said, "Xinjiang must make
full use of its rich resources in water, land, sunlight and heat."
</P>
<P>
By expanding cultivated land, increasing investment in
agriculture, improving production conditions, Xinjiang will be
able to build itself into a major grain production center and the
leading cotton production center in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The region's mineral resources must be developed in a planned
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the leader, Xinjiang should focus on expanding its
petrochemical industry and petroleum and natural gas refining
industry by taking the opportunity provided by the state policy of
shifting the country's focus of development to the west, and
relying on its rich resources of petroleum and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qiao Shi expressed his sympathy with the
people of all ethnic groups living in Jiashi County hit by another
earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale Friday. It was
the sixth time that the area was struck by a strong earthquake
over the last two months.

Committee, briefed Qiao on Xinjiang's economic and social
development.

<HEADLINE> Island Province Strives to Become China's Petrochemical Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province has
been expanding its petrochemical industry by making systematic use
of its rich offshore oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea, which surrounds Hainan, is said to have
58,000 billion cu m of natural gas reserves and 29.2 billion tons
of oil reserves in its vast two million sq km of sea areas.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the island province has decided to
treat the petrochemical industry as a pillar for economic
development and plans to develop petrochemical industrial sector
and construct large petrochemical plants mainly engaged in deep
oil refining on the western coast in the coming ten years.
</P>
<P>
While making good use of the cheap and easily-obtained natural
gas as raw material, the province will also expand the chemical
industry by building gas fertilizer production bases and
comprehensive chemical factories, and advance deep processing
industries featuring the production of high-value-added products
such as plastics and synthetic fiber out of materials made by the
oil and gas chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's plan has been implemented since the construction of an
offshore gas and chemical project in Yangpu Economic Development
Zone on the island was approved by the central government in early
March.
</P>
<P>
The project, China's largest of its kind and expected to cost
15.5 billion yuan, will include the exploration of the Orient 1-1
Gas field, construction of two sets of equipment capable of
producing 450,000 tons of synthetic ammonia, and 800,000 tons of
urea annually in Yangpu, and installation of a gas pipeline on
land.
</P>
<P>
The Orient 1-1 gas field is verified to have 100 billion cu m
of gas reserves, and the annual gas output is estimated at 2.9
billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
Before this, Hainan has started construction of another
chemical fertilizer factory in Dongfang City with the approval of
the central government.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase construction of the factory, which will use gas
from Ya13-1 of the Yinggehai Oilfield as raw material, has been
completed, with equipment producing 300,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea a year.
</P>
<P>
Ya13-1 gas field is also proved to have 100 billion cu m of gas
reserves and is reported to be able to produce 3.4 billion cu m of
gas a year.
</P>
<P>
Preparations have been made for the second-stage construction
of the factory, which will involve the building of the equipment
for producing 450,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 800,000 tons
of urea annually.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Hebang Oil Refinery in Lingao County on the
west coast, with an production capacity of six million tons, has
also been accelerated, coupled with the preparatory work for
building of some other oil and gas deep refining projects,
including projects backed by Dupont and Baasf in Dongfang City to
produce nylon intermediates, with gas as chief fuel. Construction
on a specialized floating glass project, a wood pulp project, and
a paper-making mill will start in the upcoming two years.
</P>
<P>
The province's annual gas utilization volume will reach four to
five billion cu m in 2000 and rise to 15 billion cu m in 2010, and
the province will thus net 10 billion yuan in industrial output
value in 2000, and 40 billion yuan in industrial output value in
2010, according to the sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Michael Chang was just
one step away from the championship trophy for the third time as
the men's singles final was postponed to Monday due to rain at the
1997 Salem Open Hong Kong tennis Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chang was leading Australia's fifth-seeded Patrick Rafter 6-3,
5-3 when the match was forced to be suspended by umpire and
postponed later by Organizers.
</P>
<P>
The worst case in the area would be for the two to split the
runner-up ranking points and the prize money, tournament Director
Michael Luevano said.
</P>
<P>
Taller and tougher-built Rafter made a flying start in the
opening game, with swift net play and chop shots, forcing Chang
sprawling for saves.
</P>
<P>
The two had one Ace each in the first set but Chang made two
double faults in serves.
</P>
<P>
The second set was much more thrilling as the two tried to
improve their serves and make use of every fault from their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
Chang held serve in all the games and led the seemingly final
one 3-1 before play was suspended.
</P>
<P>
Rafter had four Aces and three double faults in serves in the
set while Chang had two double faults.
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Chang won the annual Salem Open in 1994 and
1995 and was runner-up to compatriot Pete Sampras in last year's
final.
</P>
<P>
The Chang-Rafter clash is a repeat of the 1994 final, which
came out as Rafter's first defeat in the hands of the
Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, now ranked 43rd in the world, is seeking to revenge
over his four losses so far to Chang, two in 1994, one in 1995 and
one suffered earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Rafter had defeated Chang in Key Biscayne, Florida, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the 24-year-old Australian at least did not make the same
mistake this time as four years ago in the Hong Kong event.
</P>
<P>
Rafter ate some contaminated seafood on the eve of the 1994
Salem Open final and fell ill for food poisoning before he
surrendered the title 6-1, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Increases Investment in Jiangsu Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
led all other province-level areas in utilizing 9.8 billion US
dollars of contracted investment from Taiwan by the end of last
year, setting up 6,695 Taiwan-funded enterprises locally.
</P>
<P>
One-tenth of the Taiwan-funded enterprises are wholly owned by
Taiwan business people. More than 40 out of Taiwan's top 100
private enterprises have invested in Jiangsu, one of the most
developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Average investment in each Taiwan-funded project added to
Jiangsu last year exceeded three million US dollars, rising five
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 300 Taiwan-funded enterprises
with investment beyond 10 million US dollars each, and 60 with
more than 30 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Taiwan-funded enterprises are involved
in technology- and capital-intensive projects covering electronics,
machinery, chemicals, building materials, and optical instruments.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwan business people show a growing interest in
investing in provincial projects in agriculture and infrastructure
construction such as energy and transportation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Guanghan is a small city 30 km
south of Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province. But, this little known city is home to China Civil
Aviation Flight College (CAFC), the only higher education
institute to train civilian pilots in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, some 7,000 civilian pilots and
4,300 aviation engineering personnel have graduated from the
college, which was formerly the 14th flight school of the Chinese
Air Force set up in 1956, said CAFC President Wang Shixiang.
</P>
<P>
The college, assuming its present name in 1987, has also
trained pilots and air traffic controllers for Vietnam, Japan,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, and Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Himself a graduate from the college, the president said, "over
90 percent of China's civilian pilots are CAFC graduates,
including some leading officials of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), regional administrations, and
major airlines."
</P>
<P>
The college has 96 trainer planes, five training airfields, a
flight simulator center equipped with several Cheyenne and Boeing
737 simulators, and an aircraft engine maintenance training
center.
</P>
<P>
Demand for pilots has kept growing due to China's rapidly
expanding airline industry. Since 1993, CAFC has admitted each
year about 600 students, of which about two thirds will become
civilian pilots, said Wu Yaoyun, an official in charge of student
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
He said 441 students were enrolled into the pilot specialty
last year.
</P>
<P>
The students will study 28 subjects such as aeromechanics,
meteorology, and English during the four years, and undertake 230
hours of flight training, said Zhang Zelong, dean of studies.

<P>
With increasingly closer contacts between China and the rest of
the world, he added, civilian pilots are required to speak fluent
English. Coursework in English runs through the four years.
</P>
<P>
According to a CAAC plan, pilots on domestic routes must
communicate in English with ground air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
Flight training starts in the third year, including 20 hours on
simulators, 170 hours on elementary trainers, and 50 hours on
advanced ones.
</P>
<P>
Graduates will be presented a college diploma, a bachelor's
degree in engineering, and an airline transport pilot license
(frozen) after passing a test by the CAAC.
</P>
<P>
The license will enable the graduates, upon a certain period of
training in the airline, to become co-pilots on Boeing 737
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong demand for pilot students from CAFC,
President Wang pointed out the college is aware of coming
challenges.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines, one of the three leading carriers in
the country, has established its own pilot training base, while
other major airlines may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
To be prepared for the challenges, Wang noted, CAFC seeks to
enhance its competitiveness by reducing its training costs, and
improving the quality of its work.
</P>
<P>
He added the college has also set up a kind of databank
collecting information the performance of graduates in airlines,
so as to be better aware of the carriers' demand on
students.

<HEADLINE> Service Industry Contributes Half of Revenues in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The service sector in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, contributed 40
percent to the local total revenues in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to restructure the city's industrial setup to develop
the service industry began in 1990. Great changes have taken place
in the previous economic structure in which industry outweighed
agriculture and services in Shenyang, one of the country's
traditional industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the annual growth rate of revenues from local
industry has reached 10.89 percent, compared to 19.68 percent from
the local service trade.
</P>
<P>
The service industry now accounts for the bulk of local
revenues, having gained nine percent more compared to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The distribution business has witnessed the fastest development
among the local service industries, bringing in a total of nearly
5.3 billion yuan in revenues to the city during the 1991-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
Other service industries such as finance, insurance,
service, transportation, and posts and telecommunications,
all have shown a tendency toward rapid growth. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Nationwide Anti-German Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched a nationwide
anti-German demonstrations to protest the Berlin court verdict
charging Iranian top leaders of involvement in murdering Kurdish
opposition leaders in Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Demonstrators turning out in the capital
urged the Iranian government to sever diplomatic relations and
economic ties between Bonn and Tehran, to prosecute German firms
which provide chemical weapons to Iraq during the war with Iran
between 1980 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour demonstrations in in front of the German embassy
and streets in the down town sparked the maximum tensions in the
ties between Tehran and Bonn while the Iranian Parliament was
examining the latest situation in close door session.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the Berlin court verdict
on Thursday, Iran and Germany have already recalled their
ambassadors and kicked out four diplomats from the each side.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the rally were clergymen, students, government
employees, merchants, soldiers and politicians. However, some
people said that they were asked to leave the office and came for
the anti-German demonstrations in front the German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Holding large pictures of chemical weapon victims and big
portraits of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, demonstrators chanted slogans "Down with
Fascist Germany", "Down with USA" and "Down with Israel".
</P>
<P>
While condemning the verdict of the Berlin court, demonstrators
also shouted slogans "the Mykonos trial is U.S. Plot", "Verdict
is disgrace for Westerners, especially Germans", "German firms
must be prosecuted in Iran".
</P>
<P>
There was a heavy police presence in streets nearby and
along the route where the protesters were moving. The police
had to cut off the main street in front the German Embassy,
which remained closed with heavy curtain on the windows.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, other cities of the country have
also staged similar demonstrations and rallies today.

<HEADLINE> Egypt PM Embarks on Trade-Promotion Asian Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri left this morning on a 10-day tour of Malaysia,
Singapore and China in a bid to attract investment and promote
trade.
</P>
<P>
In a statement before his departure at the airport this
morning, he said that the tour is very important as a new step in
Egypt's development process that started in 1982 under the
leadership of President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Sino-Egyptian relations, he said trade and
economic cooperation should grow further to a level compatible to
their deep friendship in the political domain.
</P>
<P>
"My trip to China is designed to expand the scale and scope of
bilateral cooperation on joint ventures and enhance our two-way
trade transactions," he added.
</P>
<P>
"And I believe it could herald a new phase of Sino-Egyptian
economic cooperation," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and China fell by 9.8 percent to
407.92 million U.S. dollars last year from 452.7 million in 1995,
resulted from a sharp decline in the Egyptian export.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, reviewing the country's economic reforms, which have
been focused on the monetary field, said that they help create
a conducive environment for attracting foreign investment to
develop Egypt's projects.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his Asian trip, Ganzouri reviewed Saturday the
joint projects Egypt wants to have with the three booming
economies in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Egypt will present a number of joint ventures
with these countries for the development of southern Egypt and
implementing infrastructure of giant national projects, covering
cement, fertilizers, natural gas, phosphates and the automobile
industries.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri also presented to President Hosni Mubarak the
agreements expected to be signed during the trip, four with
Malaysia, and five with Singapore and China.
</P>
<P>
The agreements provide for protection of investments,
prevention of dual taxation, activation of trade movement and
implementation of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
On the trip which is the first by an Egyptian prime minister to
those countries since 1964, the prime minister is accompanied by a
high-level delegation grouping the ministers of electricity,
trade, industry, local administration and cabinet affairs along
with a team of investors and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Peres Meet Secretly on Forming Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Shimon Peres have
discussed secretly the idea of forming a national unity
government, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two held a secret meeting at Netanyahu's residence in
Jerusalem last week before Netanyahu departed for his European
tour, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Italy over the weekend, Netanyahu
said he was considering forming a unity government with the
Labor Party in order to advance the final-status talks with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA). But he added he had yet
made a formal decision.
</P>
<P>
Peres, currently visiting Brazil, will return home this week
to convene a Central Committee meeting of the Labor Party, in a
bid to muster support on forming a national unity government
with Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to rescue the peace process that he champions, Peres
has been an enthusiastic advocate of the unity government.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader is eager to join such a government before a
new party leader is elected in the June 3 primary. He will thus
become the senior Labor minister and retain the leadership
status no matter who is elected in his stead.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Ehud Barak, Peres' possible successor,
strongly opposes the idea of a unity government. He vowed that
he would topple the Netanyahu government rather than rescuing it
by forming a unity government.
</P>
<P>
Barak blasted Netanyahu for playing tricks to split the Labor
Party and confuse the general public with the talk of the unity
government.
</P>
<P>
He urged Netanyahu "to admit he is an utter failure in
everything." "National unity is a facade, a sure recipe for a
government of shame," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's chief opponent Yossi Beilin also opposed national
unity, saying that "instead of national unity, we will get
national paralysis."
</P>
<P>
Labor's secretary-general Nissim Zvili expressed cautious
support to the unity government, saying it should be based on
the goal of the country during a time of crisis. But he added
that the tendency within the party was preferring remaining in
the opposition to joining the unity government.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted senior Labor sources as saying that Peres
would likely win strong backing if Netanyahu agreed to evenly
divide the Cabinet seats in the future unity government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both Peres' and Netanyahu's aides hinted that
Peres might join the Netanyahu government on his own if he
failed to convince his party to support him. This will also give
legitimacy to the government because of Peres' influence abroad
as the leading architect of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Likud, tension is mounting because of Netanyahu's
renewed talk of the unity government.
</P>
<P>
Likud's ruling partner Tsomet announced its opposition to
national unity, while another coalition partner the National
Religious Party came out unequivocally against such
option. Netanyahu cannot succeed in forming a unity government
without substantial support within his own coalition.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports of forming a national unity government
in Israel, the PNA expressed welcome to the idea, saying it
could contribute to advancing the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
"At least it means there would be people in the government who
know Oslo, who worked for the peace agreement from the
beginning," said Abu Rudeineh, PNA secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Congress Deputies Address Inquiry to Provincial Government (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An inquiry sent recently to the
Provincial People's Congress of northeast China's Liaoning
Province by ten of its deputies has drawn the attention of top
provincial leaders.
</P>
<P>
With more than 2,000 years of feudal rule in China, ordinary
Chinese in the past feared officials and dared not state their
complaints directly.
</P>
<P>
But according to Quan Shuren, chairman of the Liaoning
Provincial People's Congress of, "the situation is rapidly
changing with the nation's efforts to advocate a greater sense of
democracy and encourage more political participation."
</P>
<P>
During the recently-closed fifth session of the Eighth People's
Congress of Liaoning, Jin Xisheng and nine other deputies
submitted a joint inquiry to the conference, expressing their
dissatisfaction with the government's response to one of their
proposals and asking for explanation and clarification.
</P>
<P>
Under a related Chinese law, NPC deputies who are not satisfied
with the written response to a proposal may submit inquiries,
which must be answered face-to-face and within a designated
period.

<HEADLINE> Congress Deputies Address Inquiry to Provincial Government (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of last year, Jin, director of the No.1
Lawyer's Firm of Shenyang and another nine deputies submitted a
proposal advising of the need to channel more water from the
nearby Dahuofang Reservoir. Doing so would settle the pollution
problems in the two rivers running through Shenyang, the capital
city of Liaoning, they maintained.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a year later, they received a response from the
provincial government that their proposal has been rejected.
</P>
<P>
Jin said, "We are not satisfied with the simple response."
</P>
<P>
Owing to the lack of water for diluting pollutants, the
environmental quality of the rivers had steadily worsened and
caused great harm to the residents living in the area, Jin
said. "As deputies, it is our responsibility and obligation to
urge the relevant departments to take immediate action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dahuofang Reservoir, the biggest in the province located some
100 km away from Shenyang, has a water storage capacity of 2.1
billion cubic meters. Although a diversion project had been built
and some 14 million cubic meters of water is channeled to Shenyang
yearly, this amount was believed to be far from enough.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin, the lack of water for environmental
improvement was the leading contributory factor to deterioration
of the water quality in the rivers running through Shenyang.

"This problem had caused wide concern from the residents," he
said. "The related departments that hold the power to allocate
water resources in Dahuofang Reservoir should fully consider the
residents' concerns."
</P>
<P>
He also said reconstruction was needed for a dam which was
expected to help channel water from the Dahuofang Reservoir to
Shenyang and had been destroyed by a flood several years ago,
leading to serious pollution of the daily freshwater supply in
more than 160 wells.
</P>
<P>
The deputies' inquiry was passed on to the the provincial
government. Several top provincial officials, including those in
charge of water resource management, soon met with Jin and his
fellow deputies.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that three measures would be taken to settle
the water shortage problem: an extension project to increase the
discharge of river canals in the urban area; a 30 million yuan
(3.7 million US dollars) construction project to rebuild the
destroyed dam; and a decision to allow additional six million
cubic meters of water to be channeled from the Dahuofang Reservoir
to Shenyang for environmental improvement.

The deputies were satisfied with the response, and were told
that all construction work should be completed by the end of this
year and the water in the rivers should be clean and limpid by May.
</P>
<P>
"The law and the people gave us deputies the supervisory power,
and I am very glad that I fully used the power," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese constitution stipulates that if more than ten
people are dissatisfied with a government response to a problem,
they may ask that the related authorities to dismiss certain
officials from office.
</P>
<P>
"The action of the ten deputies has not only promoted the
government's work but also helped to enhance the communication
between the government and the commoners, and I am very grateful
for that," said Vice-Governor Xu Wencai.
</P>
<P>
He said that through this event he saw both the growing sense
of democracy among the common people and the increased role of the
public in the political process.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, statistics show, a total of 243 proposals had been
submitted by deputies to the fifth session of the Eighth
Provincial People's Congress earlier this year -- the most ever
reported from the provincial people congresses.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition to Hire Foreign Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition parties have
resolved to hire an "internationally-recognized professional
negotiator" to assist them towards achieving a single
presidential candidate in the general election to be held this
year.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by opposition parties yesterday in Nyeri
said that a council of elders would be set up to enhance dialogue
between the aspiring presidential hopefuls of opposition parties
in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day meeting, opposition leaders suggested that an
opposition constituent assembly be formed to select the single
candidate should other means fail.
</P>
<P>
If opposition leaders fail to agree on a single candidate
through negotiations, they resolved to employ "a special
strategy" to force a run off between the first two presidential
candidates, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that "participants took note of the
prevailing skepticism and apathy among the people on the slow
progress towards concrete political action in the run-up to the
elections."
</P>
<P>
Last month, six leaders from opposition Ford-Kenya said that
the quest for a single presidential candidate had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
An attempt by 73 members of parliament in 1995 to form the
Opposition Alliance faced competition from a parallel group
fronted by Ford-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba and Langata MP
Raila Odinga.

Sub-committee that China is "suspected of continuing to aid

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has launched in Kariba,
north Zimbabwe, a solar cooker that might stop the further
destruction of woodlots, local papers reported today.
</P>
<P>
If adopted for use in rural areas, the cooker could help save
trees, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Shaped like a satellite dish, the solar cooker can boil a pint
of water in 10 minutes and it can be used to prepare tea and even
boil eggs.
</P>
<P>
The hand-made machine is currently attracting considerable
people including visitors who pass through the Kariba Information
Centre, where it has been on exhibition until the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Most people in the rural areas use wood as a source of energy,
cutting down a large number of trees every year.
</P>
<P>
The hand-made device costs only 50 US Dollars while a
factory-made cooker fetches up to about 150 dollars, unaffordable
for most households. enditem

<HEADLINE> Over 50 Percent of Deaths in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 percent of deaths in
Zimbabwe are diet-related, according to John Gooch, a leading
nutritionist with the Department of Biochemistry at the
University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the university showed that the increase in
chronic diseases was due to eating disorders. It was found that
an increasing number of people in the urban areas were eating
mostly refined food without the necessary nutrients such as
fibre.
</P>
<P>
John Gooch said, ''diabetes is a huge problem because people are
eating more and more refined foods and sugar.''
</P>
<P>
He added that the current local diet lacked the fibre that
traditional foods possessed and this was contributing to the current
surge in diabetes cases and also the increase in cases of heart
diseases. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is working on
regulations and measures to encourage more investment from Taiwan,
according to a senior Beijing municipal government official.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Lu Yucheng made the remarks at a national trade fair

1.54 billion US dollars from Taiwan businesses.
</P>
<P>
Lu led a delegation consisting of the Municipal Taiwan Affairs
Office, Trade and Economic Cooperation Committee, and Forestry and
Agricultural Department. It is the first time that the Beijing
Municipal Government organized a delegation to attend trade fairs
outside the capital city.
</P>

As to the attraction and use of Taiwan funds, Lu said, Beijing
will focus on hi-tech industry, tertiary industry, modern
agriculture, and key industrial sectors and products.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will try to improve its investment environment and
create still better conditions for the Taiwan compatriots,

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- This biggest coastal city in
north China has built seven tourist and scenic zones, which have
attracted tens of millions of tourists each year.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has increased efforts in improvement of tourism
infrastructure over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The seven special tourism zones consist of the downtown zone

<HEADLINE> Indiscriminate Use of Pesticides Reduces Bangladesh's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The indiscriminate use of chemical
fertilizer and pesticides in farmland is lowering Bangladesh's
food production, particularly the high yielding variety (HYV)
rice, according to a task force report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The average output of HYV rice, which was five metric tons per
hectare in 1969-1970, fell to 3.5 metric tons during the last five
years and the downward trend was continuing, according to the
report of the Bangladesh Institute of Development and Studies
(BIDS).
</P>
<P>
The report quoted BIDS experts as saying that the farmers are
indiscriminately using chemical fertilizer and pesticides in the
cultivable land, which is the main cause of reduced per acre
yield.
</P>
<P>
The report said the use of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium
in the cultivable land is highly disproportionate to soil
fertility, leading to declines in crop production, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the use of nitrogen is increasing gradually in the
cultivable land, the comparative use of phosphorous and potassium
is dropping.
</P>
<P>
This has deteriorated the whole agricultural situation,
creating hindrances to attaining food self-sufficiency in
Bangladesh by the year 2000, the report added.

WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- American Oscar De La Hoya won
a unanimous decision to take the WBC welterweight title by
dethroning fellow Pernell Whitaker in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Warns Against Spreading Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
urged the country to be wary of rumors which he said could spark
further unrest following a wave of mass violence ahead of general
elections slated for May 29.
</P>
<P>
"I always call on people and religious communities to exercise
self-control over rumors which could divide the unity of our
nation," Soeharto said Saturday in Lampung province in southern
Sumatra, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
He said the rumors had been "spread on purpose to incite
suspicion amongst us."
</P>
<P>
supporters of the United Development Party (PPP) and the ruling
Golkar party have clashed in at least five towns in the densely
populated Central Java province over the last three weeks, leaving
a trail of injured people and destruction.
</P>
<P>
In the latest violence last Wednesday, at least 12 people were
injured in clashes between supporters of the two parties in
Wonosobo district of the Central Java town of Pekalongan, "the
Observer' newspaper today quoted PPP executives as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) chief for
socio-political affairs Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid said Saturday that
the 1997 general election would be more dynamic than that in 1992.
</P>
<P>
But he hoped the contestants would abide by the prevailing
regulations in their efforts to win the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
He said ABRI had successfully traced persons behind the
incidents that have occurred in several parts of the country in
the run-up to the general elections, adding that not all of the
incidents were masterminded by a certain group of persons as some
of them happened spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
He said anyone involved in a disturbance deserved stern
measures, and ABRI was ready to safeguard the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's three political parties -- PPP, Golkar and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) -- are busy preparing for the
May 29 election.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are vying for 425 seats in the House of
Representatives in the election in which more than 120 million
people are eligible to vote.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- As many as 6,000 babies in
Thailand have the Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV), who have
contracted the deadly virus from their mothers, according to a
senior public health ministry official.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions to Fall of India's Gowda government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- There have been mixed views
from public on the fall of India's Gowda government last Friday,
the political situation, the future government and the possibility
of fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri's move to withdraw
support to the United Front (UF) government headed by Deve Gowda
shows Kesri "has a lot of confidence in himself as well as his
party," said senior deputy marketing manager of Nanda Tourism
Corporation Ltd R. Bali.
</P>
<P>
He said the Gowda government failed to take any firm decision
in its 10-month stint. No bills were passed in the commercial
sector and the share market was more or less stagnant.
</P>
<P>
On possible fresh elections, he said it would waste the
nation's money and should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
A marketing executive, Vineet Jain, said the Gowda government's
performance was "not so good. They had no special achievements to
their credit."
</P>
<P>
A leading chartered accountant, Sudhir Malik, did not agree
that Kesri did the right thing by withdrawing the support.
"Kesri's move was ill-timed. There had been signs of recession in
the past and the present move will only aggravate the situation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Gowda government showed a good performance while in
power. "Within 10 months, the government came out with an
outstanding budget and even the relations with the neighboring
countries improved," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Construction of Asia's Biggest Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China has sped up the second-phase
construction of Dalate Power Plant in its northern Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, one of the sources that provide Beijing with
electric power supply, could be be built into a station with a
combined generating capacity of five million kw, replacing Japan's
Kagoshima Power Plant, with a generating capacity of 4.6 million
kw, as Asia's biggest powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the plant has every advantage for
becoming a super-large thermal power station, with easy and plenty
supplies of water, coal, and easy accesses to transportation.
</P>
<P>
Two power-generating units, each with a capacity of 330,000 kw,
were installed for first-phase construction and started generating
electricity in 1995 and in 1996. By the end of February, the two
units had generated a total of 2.73 billion kw/hours of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
For second-stage construction, which is now under way, the
power plant will be added with the installation of two more
generating units of the same capacity.
</P>
<P>
The No.3 generating unit is scheduled to be installed and start
operation in later December this year and the No.4 unit will be
installed and go into operation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Engineers and officials with the power plant have been making
preparations for the third-phase construction and hope to kick off
the construction in 1998 and finish it in the year 2000, according
to sources.

ROME, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in Turin today that he is optimistic about the United States
paying the arrears on its contributions to the organization.
</P>
<P>
"I have the feeling that President Bill Clinton and his
government are ready to commit themselves to paying the arrears
and they recognize that the United Nations is vital to the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his recent visists to Washington, Annan said that he

U.S. Congress, but said he was confident to gain some support
there for the organization.
</P>
<P>
"I put my head in the lion's jaws and I think I can count on a

</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in the northern Italian city Friday to attend the
commencement ceremony of the U.N. Staff College, which is designed

</P>
<P>
In recent years, the U.N. has suffered financial difficulties,
owing to delay on the part of member states in paying their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States is the U.N.'s largest debtor country,
which owes a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to the U.N.'s

<HEADLINE> More Students Equipped with Pagers at College Compuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The sound of beeping can be heard
occasionally in academic lectures as paging business has become
brisk on China's university campuses.
</P>
<P>
An article in today's China Daily "Business Weekly" reported
that Yang Hengda, a professor with the People's University, is
sometimes interfered by pagers during his two-hour lectures.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang does not blame his students. "I know many of them
carry beepers for job-hunting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Present-day China's universities, which are gradually
decreasing their job-finding functions for graduates, have
inherited the role from the central economic planning era. So
graduate students have to find jobs by themselves today.
</P>
<P>
A new round of job-hunting began last autumn when the class of
1997 began distributing their resumes and job applications
through the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the spring semester, feedback from
government departments, companies and other institutions for
further exams and interviews began coming back to the schools,
which drove many students to find effective communication means to
make sure potential employers can contract them directly and
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
College dormitory rooms do not have phones. The only one or two
lobby telephones are always busy with students calling out, which
prompted many to buy pagers.
</P>
<P>
"Each beep may mean an opportunity," said Guo Jie, a senior at
Beijing Language and Culture University. That opinion made half
of Guo's 30 classmates buy pagers.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yang, who will graduate this year from People's University,
said just seven of the 38 people in his class do not carry pagers.
</P>
<P>
Pager stores in Beijing's Di'anmen reported their campus
customers rose sharply this spring. Some pager businessmen,
seeing the potential market, took initiative to attractive more
students.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Best Pager Service Company in Beijing has
launched several promotions at universities, where it offered ten
percent discounts on beepers.
</P>
<P>
Some companies leased pagers to students at one yuan per day,
which also attracted some university customers.
</P>
<P>
Pagers have been seen on campus since they became a fashion
accessory for Chinese business people in late 1980s. But before
1990, only the students involved in business bought them.

<HEADLINE> Italian Defense Minister Visits Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta held political meetings here today with Albanian leaders
ahead of the deployment of a multinational force designed to
safeguard aid delivery to the volatile Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference this evening, Andreatta said the
main purpose of his visit was to inform Albania of the operation
plan of the multinational force and discuss its status.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the multinational force's mandate is six months
at the most and it will abide by international law.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that "weapons will be used for
self-protection" if there are attacks during the aid distribution.
</P>
<P>
If the multinational force could fulfill its mission
successfully, it would create favorable conditions for Albania's
general election due to be held by the end of June, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in addition to its own direct economic aid
for Albania, Italy would urge international financial
organizations such as the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to help bail it out.
</P>
<P>
He said the bulk of the 6,000-strong international force will
be deployed from April 15, of which 2,500 soldier are from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Advance troops have already arrived to prepare ground for the
the main force, which will also include soldiers from France,
Spain, Greece, Turkey, Austria, Denmark and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Defense Minister Shaqir Vukaj told his Italian
counterpart that his country has reestablished commandos and tank
brigades, and will do its best to help the multinational mission.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi will also visit Albania
Sunday for talks with Albanian leaders on reestablishing order and
proper arrangements for refugees.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the first World Food Program emergency food aid
shipment is expected to arrive at the Albanian port of Durres on
April 15, which will represent the first consignment of U.N. food
aid to Albania since the recent civil unrest in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Warns Against "Pouring Oil Into Fire" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today called on all parties concerned not to "pour oil into the
fire" after German-Iranian relations turned strained following the
so-called "Mykonos" trial in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag,
Kinkel said Germany does not want to rupture its relations with
Iran which have lasted more than a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
The most silly thing would be to conduct a "war of cultures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first formal comment by Kinkel after the court
verdict in Berlin Thursday against four men involved in the murder
of four Kurdish opposition figures in the Mykonos restaurant in
Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court said Iranian leaders ordered the killings of
Sadegh Charafkandi, chief of the outlawed Democratic Kurdish Party
in Iran, and his three aides in 1992, a charge rejected by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Following that, both Germany and Iran have recalled their
ambassadors and expelled four diplomats from each other's capitals.
</P>
<P>
The European Union also reacted with a mass recall of
ambassadors and suspension of dialogues with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel noted that he had in the past supported political
dialogues with those Iranians also in favor of dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue which Bonn had pursued with Tehran remained
suspended for the moment, he said, stressing that a dialogue could
not be conducted at any costs.
</P>
<P>
The limit was reached when international law and the
sovereignty of another country were massively violated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also said foreign ministers of the European Union states
will meet on April 29 in Luxembourg to review relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
A "revaluation" of German and European policies toward Iran was
necessary at the moment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Germany's top industry organization earlier also appealed that
German-Iran business ties not be impaired despite the tensions
after the "Mykonos" trial in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The German Council of Trade and Industry (DIHT), the umbrella
organization of the chambers of commerce, said Friday that it was
advising German companies to maintain their business ties with
Iran and not to let themselves be drawn into political issues.
</P>
<P>
It also said that a visit by a delegation of major business
people from Tehran to Germany will still go ahead as scheduled on
April 21-25.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation, consisting of 26 representatives of
various chambers representing different industrial sectors, is
expected to visit Dresden and Hamburg before meeting German
colleagues at DIHT headquarters in Bonn on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Germany is currently Iran's biggest trade partner in Europe,
with its exports to Iran last year amounting to 2.2 billion marks
(about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) and imports from Iran 1.1 billion
marks (about 650 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Opening of Ports of Entry Facilitate Trade in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The opening of air and land ports
of entry has been instrumental in facilitating the foreign trade
flow and international tourism of the inland Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shanxi in north China scored the fastest growth rate
of overseas investment in the country, a situation which
provincial officials attribute partially to the improved ports of
entry.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1993, Taiyuan Airport in the provincial capital
opened a chartered flight route to Hong Kong, thus becoming
Shanxi's first port of entry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, more than 300 chartered flights were
flown between Taiyuan and Hong Kong, transporting approximately
20,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the airport has also accommodated medical,
tourist, and cargo chartered flights from Britain, Japan, and the
United States. And a chartered route for cargo flight recently was
added to Belarus.
</P>
<P>
A new terminal building, which was built at a cost of 250
million yuan (30.12 million US dollars), was put into use in the
airport and has improved the airport's conditions.
</P>
<P>
A land port of entry was opened last year in Taiyuan to handle
customs procedures for international containers entering and
leaving Shanxi which would otherwise be done at major sea ports in
coastal cities.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Cases in Jakarta May be 32,400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV/AIDS carriers
in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, may have reached a record high
of 32,400, but the government now puts the figure at only 162 --
101 HIV cases and 61 AIDS cases, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is based on reports from hospitals in Jakarta.
There are many HIV/AIDS cases left undetected and their number may
reach as high as 200 times of the reported cases," Jakarta deputy
governor Rs. Museno said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed deep concern over the increasing number of
HIV/AIDS cases and called for a breakthrough in preventing
HIV/AIDS from spreading further, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor said the way Jakarta residents have sexual
intercourse with illicit partners is responsible for the spread of
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS in Jakarta was first detected in 1987. In the next 10
years, the number of the cases increased to 162, with 61 of them
having developed AIDS and 36 died.
</P>
<P>
The current figure shows that 80 percent of HIV/AIDS carriers
are of productive age.
</P>
<P>
Up to February 1997, there were reported 517 HIV/AIDS carriers
in Indonesia, 393 of whom were infected with HIV and 124 developed
AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Inflation to Fall And Economy to Grow in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China will have a single-digit
inflation and double-digit growth in economy in the upcoming four
years, China Daily "Business Weekly" reported.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fan, a professor with the economic research institute of
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is quoted as saying that
low inflation gave the government a good opportunity to reform
state-owned enterprises, housing, foreign trade and financial
systems -- a must for sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
While low inflation would create a favorable environment for
reform, the success of the reform would be the only force strong
enough to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation target seems reachable, as the central government
has pledged to tighten control over credit and the scale of capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the supply of most of consumer goods
surpasses demand, while shortages of energy, raw materials,
transportation and telecommunications facilities have eased.
Market-oriented economic and legal measures are become effective
in curbing prices hikes.
</P>
<P>
Inflation pressure continues to be alleviated this year as the
rate fell to three percent in the first two months of the year,
down from 6.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate of last year was low compared with 14.8 percent
in 1995 and 21.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Yang disagreed with other economists who said inflation was
beneficial to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Revitalizing the money-losing state-owned firms is high on the
government work agenda, as is re-arranging jobs for laid-off
workers and curbing pollution.
</P>
<P>
"None of these problems can be dealt with by inflation," said
the professor, adding only restructuring of the economy can solve
them completely.
</P>
<P>
Yang believed that a ten percent growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) is appropriate, and there is no need to pursue
higher growth and the crucial task is to reform the economic
structure from investment-driven growth marked by duplicated
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The professor held that relocation of the 30 million laid-off
workers was important, bust less important compared to the task to
ensure 1.2 billion people are not affected by serious inflation.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment would decrease through reforms that rely on stable
economic growth with low price hikes. And it is important to
tighten control over bank credit, and ensure good harvests to help
control inflation, said the professor.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yang praised the successful "soft landing" after high
inflation in 1993-95, and the increasing foreign exchange reserve,
from 19.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 105 billion U.S. dollars
by the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company to Drill More Oil, Gas in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Atlantic Richfields Oil
Company (ARCO) of the United States has started work again to
conduct more oil and natural gas drilling off Myanmar's coast
after carrying out a seismic survey with the state-run Myanmar Oil
and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).
</P>
<P>
According to today's official newspaper New Light of Myanmar,
the drilling is being conducted at the Shwepiyaye test well, the
second well at Block M-9 off Mottama coast, as good prospects are
found to get oil and natural gas there.
</P>
<P>
The first test well -- the Shwepyithay at the same block, which
was drilled by the ARCO in February, was able to yield natural gas
on commercial scale one month later after the Yadana and the
Yetagun fields off the same coast.
</P>
<P>
The Shwepyiaye test well, which is located at about 260 km
south of Yangon, Myanmar's capital, will be drilled down to 3.15
km, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company signed a production sharing contract with the
MOGE in July 1995 for exploration of oil and natural gas at the
block.
</P>
<P>
Exploration is also being done at another block, which is M-7,
by the U.S. company under its second contract reached with the
MOGE last May.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Myanmar has signed over 20
production sharing contracts with oil companies from nearly 10
countries including Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, and foreign investment
in the oil and gas sector had reached 2.13 billion U.S. dollars in
34 permitted projects by the end of February this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen ports of entry intend to
increase cooperation with those Hong Kong after it retuns to the
embrace of the motherland on July 1, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will include information shared through
computer networks, administration of entry and exit of cargo and
passengers, and improving port facilities, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Investigation and Study Group on Shenzhen and Hong Kong
Port Cooperation recommended the strategies in a cooperation
proposal.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be implemented in three stages over eight years
if it is approved by both sides, says the paper.
</P>

It adds the plan will be implemented strictly on the principles
of "one country, two systems", safeguarding the nation's
interests, efficient administration and convenient entry and exit
and development for ports on both sides.
</P>

flow expected after July 1, the plan indicates.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted investigation group officials as saying that
port cooperation will be vital to maintaining Hong Kong's
prosperity and spurring Shenzhen's second economic take-off.

Easy and smooth flow of passengers and cargo through ports of
entry on both sides will help preserve Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity, they observed.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation began in 1982 when officials signed an agreement to
open more passage-ways between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>

organized by both sides has operated widely in the quarantine
fields.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Starts Party Consultations on Anointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has begun consulting local government officials of the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party on their preferred candidate in the presidential
election scheduled for 1998, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Presidential Political Affairs Adviser
Gabriel Claudio as saying that results of the informal
consultations with mayors, governors and congressmen would form
the major part of the president's basis for anointing his
successor.
</P>
<P>
An open convention, which is the traditional way of choosing
the party standard-bearer, is perceived to be divisive, Claudio
said.
</P>
<P>
Party consultations could present Ramos with his hand-picked
successor even before the convention, Claudio said, thus the
convention will merely formalize the nomination of the anointed
one.
</P>
<P>
Ramos had mentioned Speaker Jose de Venecia, Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, his sister
Senator Leticia Shahani and former Cebu Governor Emilio Osmena as
among the "presidentiable," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Claudio said the president will announce his preferred
candidate at a proper time which is to be determined by the Lakas
national executive committee.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Face Competition for Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's personal savings deposits
are expected to grow steadily despite intense challenges from the
domestic capital market, said a senior economist.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hongyuan of the State Planning Commission's Information
Center told the Beijing-based China Daily that personal savings
would increase to 4,700 billion yuan by the end of the year from
3,850 billion yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase would be good news for China's banks, which
consider personal deposits as major fund sources. Stability of
the banking sector, which provides more than 90 percent of the
State enterprises' working capital, is crucial for the country's
economic situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise expected in savings deposits, Xu noted, the
pace would be slower than last year because of competition from
treasury bonds, stocks, corporate bonds and anticipated industrial
investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the capital market this year would be the major
negative factor for the deposits' growth, which Xu predicted at
22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has decided to issue 123 billion yuan
in voucher treasury bonds this year, four times more than last
year's issue of such T-bonds.
</P>
<P>
The voucher bonds are similar to bank deposits but have higher
yields than deposits. They are expected to be bought by individual
investors.
</P>
<P>
The stock market also is attracting more investors.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Jews Urge Resumption of Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Up to 300 Jewish celebrities in
Italy appealed today for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to resume the peace talks with the Palestinians as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the Israeli leader, who arrived here
Friday for an economic conference, they said that three years
after the signing of the Oslo peace accord, all sides concerned
should try to avoid the danger that violence could degenerate into
new conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Agreements, signed in 1993 between Israel and
the Palestinians, issues such as the status of Jerusalem and
Jewish settlements were to be resolved in final-stage
negotiations, before which neither side should take unilateral
action to change the present situation.
</P>
<P>
But in mid-March, Israel decided to set up new Jewish
settlements in the Arab East Jerusalem, evoking new conflicts
between the Palestinians and Israelis. So far 12 people have been
killed and several hundred others injured in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
war and was later annexed by Israel as its united capital. The
Israeli move was not universally acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish community in Italy also urged Israel and the
Palestinians to "renew joint action to stop terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Fujimori: Peru to Quit Andean Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- President Alberto Fujimori has
announced that Peru will leave the Andean Group, media reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech last night at a meeting in the Peruvian College of
Economists, Fujimori accused the Andean Pact trade group of
working with plans that limit free and fair trade.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the Andean Group member countries met on
April 10 in Santafe de Bogota, Colombia, but failed to agree on
Peru's return to the Andean Group.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said in his speech that the main purpose of Peru to be
in the Andean Group was to develop the productive apparatus and to
create employment, but that those targets cannot be reached if the
Andean Group continues working with the present system.
</P>
<P>
"Peru has insisted on the need of renewing the Andean Group
through the approval of a set of rules related to the origin of
the products, the elimination of subsidies, and other measures
aimed to generate a free and fair trade in the subregion," he said.
</P>
<P>
On March 9, the presidents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
and Venezuela approved the creation of an Andean Community
economic bloc to replace the ailing 26-year-old Andean Group.

<HEADLINE> Car Industry Drives Changchun's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Changchun, capital of northeast
China's Jilin Province, is resolved to become China's auto
industrial production center, according to an article in today's
"Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Mi Fengjun, the city's party secretary-general, is quoted as
saying that assembly and parts plants have generated half of the
city's industrial output in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Changchun makes one fourth of China's cars, one third of its
trains and one tenth of its tractors.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun-based China First Automotive Corporation, the
oldest and largest truck and sedan production base established in
1953, is driving growth of the city's 178 assembly and parts
plants. These enterprises generated two billion yuan (240 million
US dollars) in output value from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mi said they would continue to play up auto industry by
encouraging cooperation with important international companies.
</P>
<P>
The city has now 1,108 joint ventures, involving a total
investment of 392 million U.S. dollars, he noted. From 1991 to
1995, the city's auto enterprises set up 18 joint ventures with
foreign conglomerates from Germany, Malaysia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mi went on to say that joint ventures brought in capital and
advanced technology and management to the city's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with international companies in the auto industry
-- especially parts makers -- will be reinforced," said Mi, adding
cooperation will focus on radial tires, vehicle refitting and
vehicle electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Auto industry has revitalized the city's four development
zones, including two focusing on high-tech industries, one
specializing in auto trade and one in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Mi noted that they will encourage overseas investment in
projects involving infrastructure, agriculture, resource
utilization and revitalization of state enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
Changchun is one of China's oldest industrial bases, and state
enterprises own 75 percent of the city's industrial assets, which
makes it hard to revitalize state enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese auto giant Toyota is
gearing up to consolidate cooperation with its Chinese partners,
today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted visiting company president Hiroshi Okuda as
saying that "we expect more opportunities to work with Chinese
enterprises on research of ITS (intelligent transport system),
electric vehicles, promoting TPS (Toyota production style) and
marketing and circulating system."
</P>
<P>
He added that the mission of his tour to China last week was to
inspect the progress of the construction of a Toyota-invested
motor engine project in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The 248 million US dollars project is expected to begin
production of 1.3-liter motor engine in the first half of 1998,
according to Okuda.
</P>
<P>
Annual production capacity of the 50-50 venture will be 150,000
motor engines.
</P>
<P>
Toyota has so far initiated 22 joint ventures in China, says
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The new engines will used in Tianjin-made Xiali cars, and Okuda
voiced his hope to received approval from the Chinese government
to product Toyota cars in China after they help Tianjin charade
reach an annual production level of 150,000.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Denounces Campaign Against Bananas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica has denounced what it
calls a campaign against the fruit in Europe that has caused a
drop in the country's banana exports.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to charge Costa Rica with exporting bananas with
an excess of pesticides, of maltreating the workers in the banana
plantations, and of polluting the environment, because the facts
reveal a completely different situation," Agriculture and
Livestock Minister Ricardo Garron said.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's banana exports dropped 9.7 percent in the first
two months of this year, from 95.3 million U.S. dollars in
February of 1996, to 86.09 million dollars in the same month of
1997, said the Foreign Trade Ministry in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
Garron said that the slander campaign against bananas harvested
in Costa Rica, the world's second largest banana producer after
Ecuador, does not make any sense.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica banana-cultivated area was 49,000 hectares in 1996,
5.4 percent less than in 1995, according to the National Banana
Corporation (Corbana).
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican bananas are sold in the United States, Germany,
Belgium, and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (19-20) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (19-20)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What are the two categories of Hong Kong residents,
and what are the qualifications for permanent Hong Kong residency?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Article 24 of the Basic Law, residents of
the Hong Kong SAR include permanent residents and non-permanent
residents.
</P>
<P>
Permanent residents of the Hong Kong SAR are:
</P>
<P>
(1) Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR;
</P>
<P>
(2) Chinese citizens who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong
for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or
after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR;
</P>
<P>
(3) Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of
those residents listed in categories (1) and (2);
</P>
<P>
(4) Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong
Kong with valid travel documents, have ordinarily resided in Hong
Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have
taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or
after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR;
</P>
<P>
(5) Persons under 21 years of age born in Hong Kong or those
residents listed in category (4) before or after the establishment
of the Hong Kong SAR;
</P>
<P>
(6) Persons other than those residents listed in categories (1)
to (5), who, before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, had
the right of abode in Hong Kong only.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned residents will have the right of abode in
the Hong Kong SAR and be qualified to obtain, in accordance with
the laws of the region, permanent identity cards which state their
right of abode.
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the relationship between a Hong Kong resident
and a Chinese citizen?
</P>
<P>
Article 33 of the Chinese Constitution stipulates, "any person
who has acquired a nationality of the People's Republic of China
is a citizen of the People's Republic of China." Article 2 of the
Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates, "The
People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country, and
persons of all ethnicity shall have Chinese nationality." Its
Article 3 stipulates that double nationality of a Chinese citizen
shall not be recognized. In its memorandum to the British
government in 1984, the Chinese government clearly stated, "All
Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether or not they hold
the 'British Dependent Territories Citizen's Passport,' are
Chinese citizens." All these stipulations are consistent in
principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Basic Law stipulates, residents of Hong Kong include
Chinese citizens and foreigners. Such a special phenomenon has led
to fairly complicated provisions on the rights of Chinese citizens
in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
First, rights enjoyed by Chinese citizens among Hong Kong
residents are relatively extensive. For instance, they have the
freedom to travel and to enter and leave Hong Kong, the freedom to
move within the Hong Kong SAR, the freedom to emigrate to other
countries and regions, and the freedom to raise a family.
</P>
<P>
Second, according to the Basic Law, only permanent residents of
Hong Kong have the right to vote and stand for election in the
election of the Chief Executive and the legislature. That is to
say, voters are not limited to "Chinese citizens among the
permanent residents."
</P>
<P>
Third, according to the Basic Law, the Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong SAR and its other principal officials should be Chinese
citizens among Hong Kong's permanent residents who have no right
of abode in any foreign country. That is to say, only Chinese
citizens among Hong Kong's permanent residents are eligible to
assume high official positions in the Hong Kong SAR. Article 99 of
the Basic Law stipulates, "public servants serving in all
government departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region must be permanent residents of the region, except otherwise
provided for in Article 101 of this law regarding public servants
of foreign nationalities and except for those below a certain rank
as prescribed by law."
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Article 21 of the Basic Law stipulates, "Chinese
citizens who are residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region shall be entitled to participate in the management of state
affairs according to law. In accordance with the assigned number
of seats and the selection method specified by the National
People's Congress, Chinese citizens among residents of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region shall locally elect deputies of
the region to the National People's Congress to participate in the
work of the highest organ of state power." Here "Chinese citizens
among Hong Kong residents" is apparently broader than "Chinese
citizens among permanent residents of the Hong Kong SAR" referred
to above.
</P>
<P>
In short, with the application of the "one country, two
systems" policy in Hong Kong and with realities in Hong Kong taken
into account, some complex situations have arisen concerning the
rights of Hong Kong residents and Chinese citizens among them. The
Basic Law has made proper provisions on all relevant issues.

<HEADLINE> UK's Conservatives Narrow Points With Labor in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The British ruling Conservative
Party has narrowed considerably the gap with the opposition Labor
Party, according to three opinion polls to be published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An NOP poll for the Sunday Times showed the Conservative Party
is now 20 points behind Labor, up four points from last week and
dealing a severe blow to Labor's hope of wining the May 1
election.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll in the Sunday Telegraph showed Labor only enjoys
a 16-point lead over the Conservatives, while a week ago the gap
was 23 percentage points. It was the lowest level recorded by
Gallup since Tony Blair became its leader three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gallup showed support for Labor at 49 percent, the
Conservatives at 33 percent and the Liberal Democrats at 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
An ICM poll in the Observer also put Labor 16 points ahead of
the Conservatives, but this was unchanged from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
ICM gave Labor 48 percent and the Conservatives 32 percent,
down one point from last week, while the Liberal Democrats were up
one point at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NOP poll also showed the Liberal Democrats gaining against
Labor, showing them up five points to 17 percent, their best NOP
rating since May 1996.
