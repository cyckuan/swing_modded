KNICKS TOP HEAT IN SEASON FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coach Jeff Van Gundy ordered the scoreboards that
circle Madison Square Garden turned off. He wanted to prevent the
Knicks from peeking at their playoff fate, but the crowd had cell
phones and radios and members of the coaching staff had an official
whispering cliff-hanger updates into their ears.
</P>
<P>
   As Van Gundy stalked the sidelines, watching his makeshift team
play against the Heat's makeshift team on Wednesday night, he was
told the fourth-quarter score of the Philadelphia 76ers game
against the Pistons. The Pistons were up, 20 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the disguise he had worn throughout the day and night,
Van Gundy mumbled a profanity under his breath. Privately, he had
to be pulling for the 76ers, knowing a victory by them assured the
Knicks of a first-round playoff series against the Miami Heat. This
was the team that was built by Pat Riley as a reflection of the
Knicks, a team they matched up well against and a rival that always
pulled out the gritty best from them no matter what the
circumstances. With Patrick Ewing, without Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   This was the team that gave the Knicks the best chance to erase
the turmoil of a disappointing season and prop up the job security
of all involved. The Pacers were trouble if they faced them as the
seventh seed, but where there was Heat, there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   And then destiny made the matchup so. The 76ers rallied, and
poured it on against the Pistons and took the game in overtime. And
so it was done. Just before 10 p.m., before the fourth quarter
began toward the conclusion of a meaningless, 101-88, victory by
the Kncks, the issue had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had been granted their very secret wish. The
eighth-seeded Knicks will face the top-seeded Heat in the first
round of the National Basketball Association playoffs beginning
with Game 1 Saturday at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A faint echo of ``Beat the Heat'' rang out briefly. And several
fans in the know shouted out warning to the Heat bench: We're
coming to get you. We're coming to get you, Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is beyond everyone's control,'' Riley said after
the final regular-season game was over. ``This is the way it has to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of two fights in two post-season meetings,
amid the intense nature of the rivalry that dilutes whatever
seeding numbers are assigned, the two will meet in the playoffs for
the third time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what intensity this series brings,'' said Larry
Johnson, who has been suspended twice over two years in playoff
games against the Heat. ``I can't say it'll be tense but nothing
like what happened before is going to happen again. I don't think
so. I think the playoffs are a whole new ball game. I think we can
make waves and erase the bad taste of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these teams know each other so well. What? This is the
third time in three years. To be honest, there are four or five
cats over there that are friends of mine because we've played each
other so much. We're not a typical eighth seed. This is not a
typical one-versus-eight matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   The game that was played on Wednesday night was not a typical
Heat-Knicks game, either. Before the tip, there were motives,
conspiracy theories and intrigue in a scene that played out like a
game of Clue. But by the end of the night, it didn't matter who did
it in the Garden, or by what method.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy preached winning no matter what seeding his team ended
the night with, and he maintained that the integrity of the game
was important. Van Gundy used caution as he went for the victory
with the understanding that if the 76ers had lost, they would find
themselves with the seventh seeding and playing a very physical
Pacers team.
</P>
<P>
   With the Heat already assured of the top seeding in the East and
with the Knicks holding back to prevent key injuries, there was no
Patrick Ewing, no Chris Childs, no Alonzo Mourning, no Tim
Hardaway, no Dan Majerle. As the game wore on, the minutes of Allan
Houston and Larry Johnson were whittled down, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a game with no physical defense at all, where layups were
uncontested and jumpers were made in open space, the Knicks were
led by the 22 points of Marcus Camby and the 11 assists by the
reserve Rick Brunson. The Heat were led by Clarence Weatherspoon's
18 points and 12 by Voshon Lenard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played to win,'' Van Gundy said. ``I don't even look at the
other team. I'm just worried about our team. We went out to win. I
think every time you think you know what to expect, something
different crops up. We know we're going to be a heavy underdog and
we're going to have to go down there and play great.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to know they're going to face the Heat was uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new season now,'' Houston said. ``We can regroup
physically and mentally. We have to pay attention to detail. When
we play well, especially defensively, we can beat anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Miami is number one. And they've earned that. They
were the best team in the East this year. But at the same time, we
know what we're capable of. We know we can play with them. We're
not going down there lacking confidence.'' &QL;

GAMBLE PAYS OFF FOR USC'S LEHR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Justin Lehr's desire for a trip to Omaha almost
got him a ticket to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr, now the No. 2 pitcher for the 18th-ranked USC baseball
team, would rather peek ahead at what appears to be a rosy future.
</P>
<P>
   But before all that was in place, Lehr took the unorthodox step
of transferring from UC Santa Barbara after his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been my dream to play in a College World Series in Omaha,
and I felt this was my best chance,'' Lehr said. ``I think the
transition has gone pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehr isn't speaking only of the transition to a new school. He
also switched positions -- from catcher to pitcher -- figuring it
was his best chance to play at the next level.
</P>
<P>
   All this after having been drafted in the 15th round by the
Detroit Tigers out of West Covina High School and in the 10th round
by the Angels after last season. Both teams wanted him as a catcher
first, although the Angels supposedly looked to turn him into a
closer down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a risky move on his behalf,'' said USC pitching coach
John Savage of Lehr's transfer. ``But there's some good people
here, and he's really taken advantage of the situation better than
anyone I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Lehr has become a major force on the Trojans'
pitching staff, despite the fact that his pitching career at this
level is still in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   With the regular season winding down, Lehr is 6-1 with a 4.30
ERA and a team-leading 92 innings pitched, after this past
weekend's series against UCLA. He also has three saves, 91
strikeouts and only 35 walks.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to think that, as late as August, Lehr still
wasn't sure he would be a Trojan. The school didn't have a
scholarship to offer.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, USC still was awaiting the decision of third
baseman Sean Burroughs of Long Beach Wilson, who had committed to
the school but also was the first-round pick of the San Diego
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still waiting to hear about that, when the Angels made
what they said was their final offer three days before,'' Lehr
said. ``I didn't know what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Lehr would have had his suitors had USC fallen through,
but days later, on the first day of classes, Burroughs signed with
USC and the spot opened. The postscript to this phase of the story
has had its excitement, but it certainly was a busy road getting
there.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr pitched in high school and also saw action on the mound at
UCSB, mostly as a closer or spot starter. Still, in all that time,
pitching never became a full-time passion for the 6-foot-1,
200-pound right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, however, all that changed.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr spent time pitching for the Santa Barbara Foresters and
also working with pitching coach Brian York, who is a former major
league scout in his first year at Glendale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   York became aware of Lehr when Lehr played for the Baltimore
Orioles scout team in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most sought-after catchers coming out,''
York said. ``And even now, he's still a very fine catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't pitching for the Trojans, Lehr plays first base
and at designated hitter. Catching is mostly a memory, although he
is an emergency player at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr and York hooked up through pitching coach Jim McDowell,
brother of Jack, and hitting instructor Craig Wallenbrock, one of
York's best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, (Lehr's) a major league player,'' said York, who met
weekly with Lehr all summer at Chaminade High in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty of work involved in the transition to
full-time pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we completely created his delivery,'' York said.
``We went through everything we could think of, throwing style,
videotaping from different angles, drills.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehr said his progress has been fast and steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've made a ton of progress, and I've picked up
the experience I need,'' Lehr said. ``It was a stressful situation
to make the decision to pitch all the time or whether I should
sign, but I'm glad the way it's worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage said Lehr arrived with a solid foundation and knowledge
of what it takes to be successful on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he already has a good feel how to set batters up and
finish them off,'' said Savage, who also credited Lehr's catching
experience as a plus. ``When he gets it all going, his performance
is pretty dominating.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case last Saturday against UCLA, when Lehr took a
2-0 lead into the ninth inning, only to see the Bruins rally
against the Trojans' bullpen for a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   When Lehr is at his best, he mixes in an 88-91 mph fastball with
a curve, a slider and an extremely effective changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one pitch (the changeup) that a lot of guys have a
tough time getting to be effective,'' Savage said.
</P>
<P>
   York said Lehr's pitching style resembles that of Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has those capabilities,'' York said. ``If he uses all of
his pitches, it makes them all better.''
</P>
<P>
   York is just glad things have worked out for Lehr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe how well it's worked out,'' York said.
``He hung in there and went through some emotional stress, which he
handled great . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of things are difficult for a young man. They test
a person's character, and he came through with class, dignity and
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, the rest should be easy. Although it won't be, Lehr
has made it look that way so far.

MISSING WOMAN'S FAMILY WAITS IN FEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ For almost 48 hours, Kara Wiese's family
prayed for word that their loved one, the mother of a 6-year-old
boy found wandering in the rubble, had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday night, authorities asked for Wiese's fingerprint
records. Her family feared the worst, especially after hearing
rumors that a woman's body had been found in this semirural
community 30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Wiese began almost immediately after authorities
found her son, Jordan, wandering near his home Monday night in the
ruins of the Southern Hills addition.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan told family members that he and his mother had sought
shelter in the bathroom of their mobile home when a deadly tornado
swept through town.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just ran and got in the bathroom real quick with Jordan,''
said Misty Dickson, who is engaged to Wiese's younger brother,
Dustin. ``Jordan says he put his arms around her and she put hers
around him and they held on real tight.''
</P>
<P>
   High winds ripped the trailer apart, sending both flying. Jordan
landed in a nearby ravine; his mother was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said, `I lost my mama. I couldn't find her,' '' said
Dickson, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, authorities contacted the home of Wiese's
mother, Mary Wiese of El Reno. They asked family members to bring
fingerprints to the Oklahoma medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   As Dustin Wiese made the trip to the medical examiner's office,
Dickson took care of Jordan, who was released from Southwest
Medical Center on Tuesday. The boy suffered a broken rib, and cuts
and bruises on his head, his left eye and his leg, as well as all
over his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said a tire hit him in the back,'' Dickson said. ``He got
pretty torn up, but he's OK. He just needs time to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   The kindergartner has been playing and frequently asks for his
mother, Dickson said. But the adults, although hopeful that Wiese
will be found alive, are realistic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an emotional roller coaster,'' Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   While the family was out Wednesday in the Bridge Creek community
where Wiese's mobile home once stood, a sheriff's deputy told them
that Wiese had been found alive and buried in rubble, Dickson said.
The news reached at least one local TV crew. Shortly thereafter,
officials returned and said the report was a mistake. No woman had
been found, they said.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday night's phone call, the roller coaster dipped
again, Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to be her, because Jordan won't have anything
left _ not a mom, not a house,'' Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson described Wiese as a wonderful mother who doted on
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did everything for Jordan. He had everything he needed.
She just hugged him all the time, said `Jordan, I love you,' woke
up every day and cooked him breakfast.''

49ERS GIDDY OVER RATELLE'S SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On any afternoon, a person could walk through the Long Beach
State athletic offices and hear administrators, coaches and
athletes talking up the success of a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been a lot of success to talk about, from Brian
Gimmillaro's three-time NCAA champion women's volleyball team to
Dave Snow's nationally-ranked baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   But there probably hasn't been a moment in the last five years
that has the department as giddy as Ray Ratelle and his men's
volleyball team making it to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   In the 49er family tree, Ratelle is the patriarch. The
59-year-old has been the men's head coach since 1982, making him
the dean of the staff, as well as a key player in the U.S. men's
national team development for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a colleague about Ratelle and words like gentleman,
professional, respectful, disciplined and humble will fly at you at
spiking speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we've never felt so good about one person's
success as we do now for Ray,'' Long Beach State athletic director
Bill Shumard said. ``Ray is special around here. There will be more
people wanting him to succeed this weekend than we've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is what I'd call a throwback. He has a steady hand as a
coach. He's a disciplinarian and believes in strong academics, and
his teams have always been the leaders when it comes to support for
other programs. That has been Ray's signature for his entire
career.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gimmillaro, the word that comes to mind is honorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire him for a lot of reasons,'' Gimmillaro said. ``He's a
gentleman, very smart and aware, very honorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes out of his way to always be professional. In an era in
sports where everyone gives you his opinion whether you've asked
for them or not, where there often is not a lot of respect, that's
pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   The man himself isn't much for hoopla, even if his name is
well-known and well-regarded around volleyball circles. He's
ecstatic to be in the Final Four, which starts tonight at UCLA with
the 49ers facing Indiana-Purdue-Ft. Wayne, but it won't change his
persona on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always a lot of times when you think you should be
there (in the Final Four) and you don't get there,'' he said. ``So
when you finally do, it makes the moment special.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Ratelle's third trip as the 49ers coach. His 1990 team,
his first conference champion, made it to the NCAA title game,
where it was upset by USC. He avenged that loss the following year
by beating the Trojans in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I didn't think I'd be here that long,'' said
Ratelle, who was an assistant coach on the 1973 NCAA champion San
Diego State team. ``I was a regular in the 9-to-5 world as a
pharmaceutical salesman and coached on the side, and I thought I'd
eventually give up coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was such a good situation here for me, and things have
gotten a whole lot better in the last 10 years, especially since
(school president) Dr. (Robert) Maxson and Bill Shumard came along.
They recognize volleyball and the job we're doing here, and they've
been appreciative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how that feels. When we won a title at San
Diego State, it was the first national title in the school's
history, but no one in the athletic department seemed very
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams Ratelle took to the 1990 and 1991 finals were led by
Brett Winslow and Brent Hilliard, consensus All-Americans most of
their careers at Long Beach State. Hilliard was the 1992 national
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ratelle doesn't have a standout star like that on his '99 team,
but it is one of his most experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those years, we had a go-to guy in Hilliard,'' he said. ``This
team is well balanced and the pieces all fit. It plays well
together as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this team because it knows what a struggle it has been
to get this far. It is so difficult to survive in our conference''
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, which features USC, UCLA
and every other Southern California standout ``because it's so
deep. Each year, it's an absolute dog fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're experienced. I have the same basic team this year
that I had last year, and they know how quickly things can change
in the sport. Last year, UCLA and Pepperdine were the best teams in
our region, and they returned most of their key people, but neither
made it this far because they ran into hot teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumard believes the program has never been stronger because
it's grown together. Alan Knipe, a player on the 1990 and 1991
teams, returned in 1995 as Ratelle's top assistant and has helped
the team's recruiting base. The other assistant is Andy Reed, who
was the head coach at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray believes in the simple things, like work ethic and
preparation,'' Shumard said. ``He's not big on folderol. He's from
the school of doing your job and doing it well, because that's what
you're supposed to do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of the new age thought in sports, it's nice to know
that old stuff still works.''

SPORTS ARENA'S DEMISE LIKELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those involved with Los Angeles' drive to return the NFL to an
upgraded Coliseum may have a potential solution to parking
improvements in Exposition Park: The demolition of the 40-year-old
Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL gave their conditional backing to Coliseum last
month, they added the need for 27,000 parking spaces in Exposition
Park to their wish list. Since then, the two groups vying for a
franchise -- Michael Ovitz and the Eli Broad/Ed Roski team -- and
several city officials have stepped up discussion of razing the
arena and building a parking structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sports Arena is the oldest venue in the NBA, which speaks
for itself,'' said L.A. City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has
championed the New Coliseum idea. ``We could conceivably demolish
it or find a way to adapt it for use in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to anything that makes economic sense and is
compatible with how we want to grow the Coliseum renovation and
Exposition Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Arena is the home for the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers
and USC basketball, as well as another 100 or so events a year,
ranging from circus shows, ice shows, concerts and religious
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers played their last game at the arena Wednesday
night and will move to the new Staples Center next season. USC
officials are in the early planning stages for on-campus facility
for its basketball and volleyball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lynch, General Manager of both the Coliseum and Sports
Arena, said the arena, operated by the Coliseum Commission, has
been running in the red for several years. But since the two
facilities are linked budget-wise, Coliseum revenue has made up
arena shortfall. The bond debt on the facility was retired a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facility is supposed to be self-supporting, and it hasn't
been,'' said Lynch. ``We're losing one team and we might lose
another. We've been looking toward booking additional events with
the Clippers leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is pretty obvious that a lot of events that we normally
would book will go to the Staples Center. The commission is
cognizant of the arena's future and the NFL's concerns about
parking.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent proposal presented to the NFL by the Roski/Broad
team included the use of parking lots at USC as park of park
development, but league officials rejected USC's lots as meeting
their conditions. They want 27,000 parking spaces within the
confines of the park as a way of alleviating old concerns about
neighborhood safety.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and architects from the Rockwellgroup (cq) were planning a
site survey of the Coliseum and park this week. When asked about
how the arena fits into early development plans, Ovitz said ``we're
not counting on it being there.''
</P>
<P>
   The state owns the land where the arena now sits, while the
Coliseum Commission owns the building. Lynch said the state could
approve the lease of the land to a private development group, like
Ovitz or Roski/Broad, pending approval to tear the arena down by
the Coliseum Commission.
</P>
<P>
   There would still be environmental and financial questions to
answer, however, before any wrecking ball could be ordered. While a
three- or four-story parking structure would alleviate parking
concerns, it might create traffic headaches and impact the three
museums that share Exposition Park. Approval would also have to
include agreements on how revenue from a parking structure would be
divided.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, councilman Ridley-Thomas said there has been
conversations among the two groups vying for a franchise about
combining their effort, but that it still is in the preliminary
stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of shuttle diplomacy,'' he said.
``They're trying to figure out if a partnership can be consummated
or if they want to stay on their own. I know Ed and Eli are
receptive to Michael Ovitz participating. They have been quite open
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz this week said he is continuing to work on his own
business plan and stadium model in anticipation of the next round
of NFL meetings, May 25-26 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said L.A. expansion is one of three
issues on the agenda for those meetings. But he doesn't expect the
ownership to select an ownership group or set a franchise fee in
Atlanta. The NFL has set a deadline of Sept. 15 for an L.A. plan to
be in place and approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more focus on stadium development and
the business plans the expansion committee wants to see,'' he said.
``We've heard talk about the Sports Arena being torn down, but
that's an issue for the Los Angeles groups to determine.''

PEREZ MISSES START WITH INJURED KNEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez was scratched from
his start Wednesday against the Montreal Expos because of a
right-knee injury and will be examined by a doctor today in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he didn't know specifically how he injured his knee
but said it was sore after he was shagging fly balls in the
outfield Tuesday at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But there is speculation throughout the organization Perez
injured himself while out late Tuesday night, a no-no for pitchers
the night before they pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he's heard the same
speculation regarding Perez, but said he wouldn't confirm it
because he hadn't yet talked to Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, Malone said: ``The way I feel right now I don't feel I
should. I feel I should wait for a more appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone would not talk specifically about Perez, but made it
clear that if Perez was out late instead of resting for his start
there would be repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If certain players don't have the respect and concern for
their teammates, maybe they should be somewhere else,'' said
Malone, echoing comments he's made in the past. ``If there is a
player or players that have that attitude, they won't be Dodgers
very long. But I'm not insinuating anything.... As of right now, I
believe what (Perez) said is the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who signed a three-year, $15 million contract during the
offseason, emphatically denied he was anywhere but in his hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mess around before days I pitch,'' Perez said. ``I
don't want to be in the middle of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most starters, Perez left Tuesday's game in the fifth
inning. He said he usually doesn't eat in the clubhouse so he went
out to a restaurant to have dinner but returned to his hotel by
10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay me good money to work and that's what I'm going to
do,'' Perez said. ``This is the kind of team that can win a World
Series and I want to be in the organization.... I want to make sure
there's no joking around with my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hopeful Perez will be able to start Tuesday
against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Perez (1-3, 5.65 ERA) couldn't bend his knee and had a
cane in his locker to aid in his walking. Jamie Arnold made the
emergency start for the Dodgers and took a no-hitter into the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he was notified in his hotel
room at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday that Perez was injured. Dodgers trainer
Stan Johnston examined Perez and his knee was iced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Dodger trainers) said it's not structural,'' Malone
said. ``It's severe tendinitis, inflammation in the knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Perez has never complained about tendinitis in his
knee. Perez will be examined by team physician Dr. Ralph
Gambardella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the situation,'' Perez said. ``I hope it's not
serious. I hope it's nothing. When I walk, that was a lot of pain.
It took me like 10 minutes to get in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how it happened. When I finished practice
yesterday I felt a little pain. After the game I felt a little
pain. I don't know what it was. I felt this pain, I couldn't
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He left here (Tuesday) and was in pretty good shape, but he
can't hardly walk,'' Johnson said. ``I guess he woke up and said he
can't walk. He's not very good at all. I joked earlier with him,
`What floor did you jump out of?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has a reputation of being flamboyant. On the mound, he's
known for twisting his body and pumping his first after pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Perez, a former Expo, was known in Montreal as a
person who enjoyed the flavor of the city. He was frequently
spotted on Crescent Street, a bustling area filled with nightclubs
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre was
held out of the game with tightness in his hamstring. Dave Hansen
started in his place.... Devon White led off for the Dodgers in
place of Eric Young, who's nursing a sore right calf. Mark
Grudzielanek, who batted leadoff Tuesday and went 0 for 4, was
dropped to eighth in the order.

MO'S ON FIRST, ANGELS ON TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Mo Vaughn broke a sweat Wednesday night, and that was
big news for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Playing his first game at first base since opening night,
Vaughn's two-run homer in the fourth inning led the Angels to a 4-1
victory over the Detroit Tigers before 12,676 at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's sprained left ankle still hurts _ he talked to
reporters after Wednesday's game as a tube pumped cortisone into
the ankle _ but being back on the field instead of serving as
designated hitter means a lot to him and the club.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went right for the Angels on a night that must have
been what manager Terry Collins envisioned before an influx of
injuries sent the club into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Steve Sparks (1-3) got his first victory of the
season after allowing one run and three hits in eight innings. Troy
Percival struck out two in a 1-2-3 ninth for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   And Darin Erstad, back in left field for the first time since
Vaughn's injury, hit a two-run homer and made a diving catch to rob
Tony Clark of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But it all started with Vaughn, whose home run off Tigers
starter Jeff Weaver (3-2), turned the game around. Through three
innings, Simi Valley High graduate Weaver didn't allow a hit,
walked only one and struck out five as the Tigers had a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth, Randy Velarde singled to open the inning
before Vaughn hit to left field on a 3-2 pitch for his fourth homer
of the year and a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much of a better flow being in the game,'' Vaughn
said. ``You generate blood flow and sweat. I'm surprised I did as
well DH-ing as I did. I was just not into it. Now I feel a part of
the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings something to the table not many people do,'' Erstad
said of Vaughn. ``He's Mo Vaughn. His reputation precedes him. The
way he flows, the way he moves, the way people feed off him. When
he's not in his element, he's not comfortable. Now he's in his
spot, his normal routine. He's ready to roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, facing Weaver was a challenge for Vaughn and the Angels
Wednesday. Weaver entered the game 3-1 with a 2.45 ERA, his only
loss coming in a 1-0 setback to Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the season is like a cloak and dagger,''
Vaughn said. ``You haven't faced these guys and nobody had ever
faced (Weaver). You almost give yourself up in your first at-bat to
see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting the loss, Weaver allowed only two runs and three
hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the victory was Sparks' first of the year, he's
recently been on a roll. In his past three starts, he has allowed
only two earned runs in 202/3 innings. He helped himself in the
second when his fake pick-off attempt toward third got Juan
Encarnacion to break from first.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks threw him out at second.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Sparks allowed only one hit from the third inning
through the eighth. The difference now from his first three starts
(15 earned runs in 141/3 innings) is that his knuckleball is around
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to think early in the year,'' Collins said.
``He had trouble throwing strikes and (the catchers) had trouble
handling it. But the last few times out he's been around the strike
zone. That makes such a big difference. You get guys to swing the
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of things (pitching coach) Dick Pole
worked on with me and my mechanics,'' Sparks said. ``He kept me on
line toward home plate, like a little hallway towards home plate.
If you get guys to swing early in the game and you pound the strike
zone early, it makes all my pitches that much better.''

UNIONS SEEK TO FORCE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE FACULTY TO PAY DUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With Democrats in control in Sacramento, unions
are again seeking state-mandated rules that will force employees at
California State University and University of California campuses,
including faculty, to pay dues whether they join the union or not.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-union faculty members are opposing a so-called ``agency
shop'' bill out of the state Senate that has already passed one
Senate panel and is now headed to appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members such as California State University, Northridge,
economics professor Shirley Svorny resent being forced to pay for a
union that they believe does not represent their needs and
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the union has served the faculty well in
terms of negotiations,'' Svorny said. ``I don't want them to
represent me.''
</P>
<P>
   Union activists say requiring dues from nonmembers who receive
full representation on matters such as contract negotiation and
grievances is only fair.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Meisenhelder, president-elect of the California Faculty
Association and an English professor at California State
University, San Bernardino, compared agency shop to taxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody likes taxes,'' she said. ``But it's not
voluntary. But people do understand that in order to have an
effective government everyone has to pay taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees could appeal for exemptions, Meisenhelder said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require all employees to pay a ``fair share'' of
union due fees. For faculty, that would amount to 85 percent of
total dues. Full membership and voting rights would be granted to
those who pay in full.
</P>
<P>
   The measure promises to more than double the number of employees
paying dues. Right now, only two in five faculty employees in the
two university systems -- or about 7,000 full- and part-time
professors, librarians, counselors and coaches -- choose to join
the California Faculty Association.
</P>
<P>
   Members pay a little less than 1 percent of their gross salary
per year in dues. The union's 1998-99 revenues from dues are about
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The entire CSU system has seven unions.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 645, authored by Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco,
was introduced Feb. 24 and was passed 9-4 April 14 by the Senate's
Education Committee. Efforts to contact Burton on Wednesday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Burton spokesman Dave Sebeck said Burton is ``a
longtime believer in agency shop and fair share representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has been attempted before only to be vetoed
under previous Republican governors George Deukmejian and Pete
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Although supporters and opponents alike predict the bill will
sail through this time under Democratic leadership, Gov. Gray Davis
has not expressed support for or opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently the governor does not have a position on this
bill,'' said Linda Choi, spokeswoman for the governor.

VAUGHN BACK AT FIRST; ERSTAD IN LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For the first time since opening night April 6, Mo
Vaughn played first base for the Angels on Wednesday night at Tiger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who sat out 14 games with a sprained left ankle, started
the previous 12 games at designated hitter. On Tuesday, the Angels
had Vaughn participate in extensive defensive drills and he showed
them he was ready to play the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said nothing bothers him except sliding and running the
bases,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``I told him he didn't have to
worry about sliding _ don't slide. As he's going to have to run the
bases anyway if he hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had been itching to play in the field for days but
listened to the Angels trainers and Collins when they urged him to
be cautious. On Wednesday Vaughn finally got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big because it helps you get into the flow of the game,''
Vaughn said. ``You can contribute on both sides. I'm a better
player all around.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vaughn at first, Darin Erstad moved back to left field.
Erstad will be able to adjust to playing the outfield easily, but
he's had trouble adjusting to varying roles as a hitter. Erstad
began Wednesday hitting .248 with two homers and nine RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad has 13 starts in the three-spot and five at No.5.
Wednesday he was back in the leadoff spot for the 10th time this
season, and that's where he'll stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where he's going to be,'' Collins said. ``Whatever
makes him comfortable is what we need to do because he's off to a
slow start. Last year the first half of the season he carried us.
We need to get him going.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad and Collins discussed the issue and agreed that Erstad
needs to stay in one spot. And he spent all of spring training
hitting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be in a normal routine every day,'' Erstad
said. ``If I'm going to be there for the rest of the season, I'd
like to be there now. You don't have to look at the lineup ever.
It's not ever a question. Now you can focus on baseball. I've
always been a routine-oriented person.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the wrist: Right fielder Tim Salmon sat out his
second game in a row with a sprained left wrist and is listed as
day-to-day, but he is not the only person in the Angels clubhouse
with a bad left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Bill LeSuer, the Angels' muscle therapist, also has a sore left
wrist. And how he injured it is a telltale sign of what's wrong
with the Angels this year.
</P>
<P>
   LeSuer hurt the wrist doing his job _ massaging sore muscles
that Angels players take with them into the training room.
</P>
<P>
   But LeSuer isn't going to the disabled list. ``I'm just working
right-handed now,'' he said. ``And I'll use my feet if I have to.''

   KOSOVO-MASSACRE (Skopje, Macedonia) _ Betrayal is the theme of
the story of Slovinje, a village in Kosovo. Of the 600 homes there,
40 belonged to Serbs and the rest to ethnic Albanians. When the
violence began in the province, the Serbs of Slovinje told their
Albanian neighbors that they had nothing to fear from the army or
paramilitary forces. But last Friday, two mass graves were dug up
in Slovinje, and 16 muddy corpses were laid out in a schoolroom.
The story is incomplete without independent confirmation: In
separate interviews, 17 Kosovar Albanians who had been in Slovinje
on April 15 and 16 told their stories to The New York Times during

   BRAZIL-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ It may appear to many investors

Improvement,'' a prime-time hit on ABC for the past eight seasons.
After a tearful Tim Allen, the star, told a joke for a cast and
crew drenched in tears, they taped a slightly maudlin story,
scheduled to be broadcast on May 25, in which Allen's character
reaffirms his love for his wife and family, and his loyal sidekick
finds the love that had long eluded him, lending the closing a
poignant moral gravity. The episode is touching, and a historical
relic, as the traditional family sitcom goes the way of the

DODGERS' ARNOLD BEATS JITTERS, EXPOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Dodgers rookie Jamie Arnold arrived at Olympic
Stadium with no idea what happened to left-hander Carlos Perez's
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   How could he? Even Perez said he doesn't know the answer to how
he was injured. It's a question the Dodgers brass is also asking.
</P>
<P>
   But with Perez out with a swollen knee, manager Davey Johnson
turned to Arnold for what turned into the most memorable night of
his eight-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major-league start, Arnold took a no-hitter into
the sixth inning and allowed one hit in 62/3 shutout innings as the
Dodgers beat the Montreal Expos 8-2 on Wednesday to finish their
nine-game road trip with seven wins.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield added a three-run homer in
the third inning and a solo homer in the ninth. It's the first time
Sheffield homered since he hit two April 17 at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more nervous about this start then my first professional
outing,'' said Arnold, whose major-league debut was pitching out of
a bases-loaded, one-out jam against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, (Eric Young) asked me if I was starting,''
Arnold said. ``I said I didn't think so. Five minutes later I found
out I was starting and the butterflies began.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Arnold did was call his family in Kissimmee,
Fla., to tell them to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing the 25-year-old former first-round pick of the
Braves did was dominate the Expos like this was rookie ball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wanted to hold Arnold to 60 pitches.
Astonishingly, Arnold (1-0) threw just 60 pitches in nearly seven
innings. Orlando Cabrera's leadoff single to left in the sixth was
the only hit he allowed. Arnold, a reliever since 1997, walked one
and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a non-roster invitee to spring training after
signing a free-agent contract with the Dodgers during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great stuff to begin with, but obviously, we needed
someone to step up and he did it,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley
said. ``I was going to try and keep him in the game as long as
possible because I knew he was capable of pitching like this.
That's that we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez will be examined in Los Angeles today by Dodgers team
physician Dr. Ralph Gambardella.
</P>
<P>
   Though Perez couldn't bend his knee and spent most of the
pregame getting treatment, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said he's hopeful Perez will start Tuesday against the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   If Perez isn't available, Malone talked before the game about
promoting a starting pitcher from Triple-A Albuquerque. The leading
candidate is right-hander Mike Judd. He's 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA, but
Malone and Johnson said Judd's pitched well lately. In eight career
games with the Dodgers, he has a 12.21 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   However, after watching Arnold dazzle the Expos, Johnson had
another plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over to the other starters and said, `See how easy it
is, fellas,''' Johnson said. ``I think I might look at him to get
another start. I'm dumb, but I'm not stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the Fox Group didn't force Malone to cut the
payroll and deal Dave Mlicki, which sources said occurred, the
Dodgers wouldn't be facing this predicament. They were one of the
few teams overloaded with starting pitchers but now could be in the
market for a fifth starter. And it could be for much more than the
$2.25 million Mlicki makes this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if we had him now, yeah,'' Malone said. ``If
this is a long-term problem, it's definitely worse than we're
hoping for. We're optimistic he'll be able to pitch May 11.''

ASTROS BEAT METS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The routine had become routine for Bobby Valentine.
When the game stretched into the late innings, he picked up the
phone to the bullpen, summoned one of the Mets' superb relievers
and watched them hold tight to another lead and secure another
victory. Valentine's routine had become very routine and it was
very successful.
</P>
<P>
   But that seamless routine ended abruptly and ended emphatically
on Wednesday night when Jeff Bagwell crushed Armando Benitez's
fastball into the left-field bullpen for a two-run homer that
helped vault the Houston Astros to a 5-4 triumph over the Mets at
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were four outs away from celebrating a night in which
Bobby Jones was effective and Bobby Bonilla was cheered, but they
faltered in the eighth inning and lost for the second straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   After Bonilla's single started a rally that reached its climax
with Roger Cedeno's single that put the Mets in front, 4-3, in the
seventh, Benitez (0-1) was called upon for the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez walked Bill Spiers then rebounded by getting the next
two batters out. But then he pumped a 91-mile-an-hour fastball that
was chest high, and Bagwell whacked it for a two-run home run, his
eighth homer in the last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Benitez, who had allowed only two runs in 122/3
innings, had allowed that many in two-thirds of an inning on
Wednesday night. Suddenly, the bullpen that had saved 12 of its
first 13 save opportunities had faltered. Instead, Billy Wagner
struck out the final four Mets to notch his 10th save for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glamour of the inning was a real good hitter hitting a
ball over the fence,'' Valentine said. ``The story of the inning
was there were four balls thrown to that first hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, who said he rushed against Spiers and that is why he
walked him on five pitches, also misplaced the fastball to Bagwell.
Now the Mets must watch Benitez a little closer; he sometimes lost
confidence with the Orioles after giving up critical hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``''I tried to throw the ball outside,'' Benitez said. ``I
missed my location and he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly relieved Bagwell said: ``I can do that every once in
a while. Benitez is probably going to strike me out more times than
I'm going to hit homers. He's very tough. He's not a treat to
face.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets (17-11) finished their homestand with a decent 6-3
record and will journey to Arizona to begin a nine-game road trip
on Friday. But this is a game that should make the Mets ache
because they had a one-run lead at a point in which they have been
dominant, and they had already mishandled some chances at a larger
lead. Mike Piazza hit into a double play with the bases loaded, and
was nabbed off first after a lineout when he did not slide; Edgardo
Alfonzo smacked into another double play with two runners on, and
Rey Ordonez was gunned out at home on a powerful throw by left
fielder Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to forget about this,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Bonilla, whose sacrifice fly in the fourth
had given the Mets a 3-2 lead and earned him a standing ovation,
was cheered a second time after he singled off Jay Powell (2-0) to
open the seventh. The pinch-runner Jermaine Allensworth replaced
Bonilla and later scored on Cedeno's looping single to give the
Mets a 4-3 lead. Earlier, Bonilla had been berated when he made a
lazy throw to second and a blooper that he chugged after had
dropped fair by a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who gave up three earned runs in seven innings while
striking out eight and walking one, could not hold the 3-2 lead for
too long as Tim Bogar doubled with one out in the fifth. One out
later, Craig Biggio rapped a double between Brian McRae and Bonilla
into the right-center-field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who is wearing a cumbersome brace because of a torn
ligament in his right knee, hobbled after the ball and was about 10
feet away from it when it dropped. While Bonilla would have had to
make a splendid running catch, the Mets had to wonder if a speedy
outfielder like Allensworth would have caught the ball. Later, the
Mets also had to wonder what happened to their bullpen routine last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you miss the spot,'' Benitez said. ``You're human.
You know?''  &QL;

PETTITTE HELPS YANKS GET BACK ON TRACK WITH WIN OVER TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Andy Pettitte lowers his chin when he stares in
for the sign from the catcher, the bill of his cap dropping as
well, and nearly hiding his eyes from view. His field of vision is
restricted from this angle, his sightline no higher than the first
few rows of the stands behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   This is his world: Pettitte sees the catcher and his glove and
the hitter, and Wednesday night, he ruled his world, shutting down
the Minnesota Twins in a 5-3 victory on an evening when the New
York Yankees needed to re-establish themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had been guilty of flawed performances that were
repeated, and with Pettitte permitting just five hits over 7 2-3
innings and Tino Martinez driving home two runs, the Yankees'
universe turned right side up, finally.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had lasted just 3 1-3 innings in his previous start,
against Kansas City last Friday, and his response to that Wednesday
night was typical. Pettitte has had outings of five innings or less
nine times since Aug. 30, 1995, and each time, Pettitte has won his
subsequent outing.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte and Martinez and the core veterans of the Yankees give
this team an unshakable foundation in 1999. No matter how poor the
bench is right now or how little production the Yankees are getting
from their left fielders, regardless of Jorge Posada's deep slump,
the first six hitters in the Yankees' lineup are probably as good
or better than any other 1-to-6 group in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The middle relief is a mess, but if the Yankees have a lead in
the eighth or ninth inning, there is perhaps the best closer in the
game, Mariano Rivera, who got the save Wednesday night. Hideki
Irabu is floundering, but he is surrounded by pitchers who have had
ample success and thrived under pressure, from David Cone to
Pettitte to Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those times when the Yankees struggle _ and they have
played truly awful baseball at times _ they will win many games
because of that foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, the rookie left fielder, is hitting well under .200
and has no home runs and two runs batted in, and his poor defense
is being exploited. But the foundation allows the Yankees to keep
Ledee in the big leagues and give him the opportunity to work
through his troubles, rather than demote him to Triple-A; they can
win without contributions from Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation that includes Joe Girardi as the backup catcher
affords Posada a day or two off to clear his mind, take extra
batting practice and reflect on his recent failures. Posada's slump
eats at him, and the Yankees will be much better whenever he
emerges. But he could flounder all year and the Yankees can win.
</P>
<P>
   Posada didn't play Wednesday night and won't play Thursday, in
the final game of the Yankees' 10-game road trip. Don Zimmer, the
interim manager, wanted Girardi to catch Pettitte Wednesday night
and David Cone on Thursday. Ledee went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts
and a misplay in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees thrashed the Twins anyway and improved their record
to 17-9. They jumped on LaTroy Hawkins, the Minnesota starter, for
two quick runs in the first inning. Luis Sojo dumped a single into
right field and Paul O'Neill followed with a single. Hawkins
retired Bernie Williams with a low curveball, Williams grounding
out to first base and both runners advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling good about his curveball, Hawkins then tried another in
throwing to Martinez _ and the Yankees' first baseman pulled a
double into the right-field corner. Sojo scored, O'Neill followed
and the tone was set. Scott Brosius blasted a solo home run in the
second inning, increasing the Yankees' advantage to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis beat out an infield single leading off the fourth.
The second baseman always plays deep on the artificial surface
here, and Davis managed to leave a bouncer in front of the Twins'
Todd Walker. It appeared Davis would be stranded, when Ledee
whiffed and Brosius grounded out. But Joe Girardi slapped an
infield single to deep short, and when the throw got past first
baseman Ron Coomer, Davis scored; Girardi came home when Derek
Jeter doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte would have won with much, much less. He rarely pitched
deep into the count. He went to a three-ball count only three times
in the first four innings and whenever he needed a big pitch,
Pettitte would lean back and fire his cut fastball at the hands of
the Twins' hitters, or perhaps a sinking fastball. Pettitte
generated 15 ground-ball outs, including two double plays, and fell
just short of becoming the first Yankee pitcher to throw a complete
game this season.

SHOT-BLOCKING DOWN FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Shaquille O'Neal's usual offensive dominance had him
chasing a scoring title this season, but as the Lakers wrapped up
the 50-game slate, O'Neal also turned in a career-low on the other
end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's shot-blocking average of 1.69 per game is a block per
game lower than his career mark and by far the lowest for any
season in his seven-year NBA career. He averaged 3.53 as a rookie
and had never averaged fewer than 2.0 per game.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the Lakers' defense has ranked near the bottom of
the league, O'Neal's shot-blocking decline might simply be a
reflection of his team's struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't for a long time been playing very good defense,''
coach Kurt Rambis said. ``Our transition defense wasn't there _
it's hard to block shots when you're not back on defense.
Regardless of whether it's him or anyone else, teams were getting
opportunities to score. I know his stomach (abdominal strain) has
bothered him intermittently throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're doing our job defensively, we're forcing them to come
into him, which gives him the opportunity to block shots. If our
defensive rotation isn't there, then they're standing outside,
shooting wide-open jumpers. It's pretty tough for someone to block
those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that O'Neal is too concerned with being 15th in the league
in blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never seen a big man come in here and dominate me,'' he
said. ``They might score one or two jumpers, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wouldn't hazard a guess as to the reason for the decline
but said his sore abdomen was not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to help guards, and all of that. I can't do everything
at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Miami's Alonzo Mourning, an MVP candidate because of
his defense, averaged 3.91 blocks this season, O'Neal got
sarcastic: ``I guess that's why he's the best big man, and I ain't
(bleep).''
</P>
<P>
   Back to class: With at least two free days before taking on
Houston in the playoffs, Rambis is eager to use the time for
much-needed practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game we play, we break down the tape to show the guys:
Here's some great things that you did, here's some not-so-great
things you did. Here's a guy that was open on this play, you need
to find this guy. It's just a matter of making the players aware of
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis also figures to lengthen both practice time and film
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get guys out there for five hours on the court.
We want to try and make it hard and concise and keep them in the
hour-and-a-half to two-hour range, but we will have much longer
film sessions. Since you have time to focus and concentrate on one
(opponent), you can break down a lot more tape and spend time with
the guys and show them individual things.''

DEBATE RAGES OVER WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the harbor seal population began to diminish, the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service stepped in and made it illegal to hunt, touch
or hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the mountain lion's ranges are severely depleted,
California voters decided -- twice -- that no agency could kill
one.
</P>
<P>
   Another state measure bans the trapping of animals. And the
Department of Fish and Game was set to kill a population of beavers
near Lake Skinner in Riverside County that was threatening the
endangered gnatcatcher until a group of citizens stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of federal and state wildlife and
conservation organizations supporting various causes. But should
these organizations dictate wildlife policy?
</P>
<P>
   The debate over who should manage wildlife has been an issue for
decades. With humans invading even more wildlife space, the issues
have become virtual lightning-rods.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the job of DFG director Robert Hight and the Fish and Game
Commission -- all appointed by the state governor, who is elected
by the people -- to determine what is best for the state's
wildlife? Or is it the job of organizations to determine that
policy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely oppose specialty groups getting involved in
wildlife management,'' said Ed Hover, the California Conservation
Director for the Izaak Walton League. ``That should be in control
of the Department of Fish and Game. What these groups do is a lot
of (political) lobbying. They're thinking of Bambi, dealing with
sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mountain Lion Foundation executive Lynn
Sadler says it's not fair for the DFG to run roughshod over these
organizations. Instead, the state should look at other methods of
solving these issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about what to do with mountain lions, beavers or
gnatcatchers,'' she said. ``We're saying that they should try to
find other ways to do things. The agencies are not following the
public's wishes. They've been like a bunch of kids that want their
way. All we're saying is there are different ways to handle things
and a lot of interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation protecting endangered species had significant
statewide impact:
</P>
<P>
   Anglers now curse at harbor seals for stealing their catch as
they reel in the fish. The City of San Diego has had to rope off a
portion of its popular Children's Pool beach at La Jolla to protect
the seals from people. Many boaters and anglers up and down the
West Coast consider the animals a menace.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mountain lion initiative was first passed in 1992,
hunters claim that it has ruined the state's deer population,
resulting in fewer in-state hunting license purchases and less
funds to support California's wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   A pack of mountain lions in the Eastern Sierra has almost wiped
out a strain of Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep, leading the Department
of Fish and Game to change the listing of the animal from
threatened to endangered. The Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep
Interagency Advisory Group says there are fewer than 100 sheep in
the strain and the decline has been attributed primarily to
mountain lion depredation. They are contemplating moving the herd
to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been more reports of mountain lions attacking
humans throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   After traps were made illegal in last November's election, two
coyotes attacked a San Jose-area hiker. Biologists say the only way
to remove the animals safely is through traps; no other method will
work effectively. The non-native red fox has established residences
in Orange County and biologists suggest the foxes -- which can be
effectively removed with traps -- destroy feeding patterns by other
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that support just one animal include the Mountain Lion
Foundation, California Trout, Ducks Unlimited, Quail Unlimited,
National Wild Turkey Federation, Rocky Mountain Elk Deer Foundation
and Society for the Conservation of Bighorn Sheep.
</P>
<P>
   There are some organizations that support various nature causes:
the Sierra Club, Izaak Walton League, Nature Conservancy, National
Wildlife Federation, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group is beneficial,'' says Patti Krueger, a biologist
for the Angeles National Forest. ``A group like Quail Unlimited may
be interested in protecting and improving the habitat of quails,
and their work benefits all other species.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, should organizations like Cal Trout, which has sued the
state to create catch-and-release areas, or the Mountain Lion
Foundation, which was behind the mountain lion initiative, pick and
choose policies that fit their organization's mission statement?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with specialty groups that focus on one animal is
that they may focus on the problems of that animal and overlook the
overall picture,'' Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extremists everywhere. A wildlife manager has to
look at everything and the fact is there are not enough zoos to
fill the (excess) animals. The fact is the San Diego Zoo can only
take so many beavers and mountain lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hover is unhappy with the harbor seals decree, saying the seals
have wiped out the Pismo Clam population.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that changing water conditions, pollution and less
fish been a factor, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scavengers -- not sharks,'' the Hacienda Heights
resident says of the seals. ``They overeat and ruin pristine
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to move (sea) otters and the otters weren't part of
the contract,'' said Sadler, who says groups cannot become too
focused on their animal, but must look at the whole picture, too.
``They went right back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The seals have rights, too,'' Dorene Carlson told one
newspaper about the seals occupying La Jolla beaches. ``By leaving
them alone, we're teaching our children to respect other
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger says the heart of the matter is the management issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, who is managing the (mountain lion) herd?'' she
said. ``The Department of Fish and Game feels by hunting, it can
manage the herd and they feel they can do that without a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When wildlife begins preying on humans and pets, Krueger says
wildlife management could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an animal is consistently in back yards and not utilizing
its habitat, that means it is being pushed into urban areas,''
Krueger says. ``If an animal is completely protected, then you're
lacking the ability to look at the big picture. Wildlife is then
being influenced by people.''
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for controls, the bald eagle and the gray whale
would not have rebounded from the endangered lists, and the
mountain lion and harbor seal might have replaced the eagle and
whale on those lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is,'' Sadler said, ``do we have a Mountain Lion
Foundation to protect only mountain lions, or do we follow our
mission statement to protect all California wildlife, with the
mountain lion as a point of reference from which we look at the
entire (eco-)system?''

YET ANOTHER SETBACK FOR BOEING'S ROCKET BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The second consecutive failure of The Boeing Co.'s new
Delta 3 rocket was not only a setback for the company's
opportunities in the space business, but a blow to U.S. efforts to
recapture a larger share of the global launch services market,
industry experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the second stage of the Delta 3 misfired about 20 minutes
after launch Tuesday night from Cape Canaveral, Fla., it left an
important Asian communications satellite owned by Loral Orion
stranded in a useless orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are trying to salvage what they can of the $235
million mission, but Loral CEO Bernard Schwartz said Wednesday the
Orion 3 satellite apparently was a ``total loss.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the second time in eight months, Boeing was forced to
appoint a team of investigators to determine why its powerful new
rocket malfunctioned. The first Delta 3 exploded on its maiden
flight last August, destroying a Galaxy X communications satellite
built by Hughes for PanAmSat Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This was the sixth significant launch failure of either a Boeing
or Lockheed Martin rocket since last August, failures which have
resulted in the loss of several billion dollars worth of military
and commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Half those failures involved Boeing. Two Delta 3 rockets didn't
work, and a Boeing-built motor malfunctioned last month, leaving a
military satellite in a useless orbit after it was launched by a
Lockheed Martin Titan rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a disaster,'' Marco Caceres, a rocket and space
analyst with the Teal Group, said of the string of recent U.S.
mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of failures is driving commercial customers overseas in
search of more reliable launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Gen. Howell Estes, former commander of the
U.S. Space Command, told Defense Daily on Monday, one day before
the latest Delta 3 failure: ``Right at the time that the commercial
sector is set to take off, we run into this launch problem that
brings things to a screeching halt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orion 3 mission was covered by insurance, including the
estimated $85 million cost of the rocket, so the material loss for
Boeing is insignificant. But as a result of the back-to-back Delta
3 failures, Boeing has lost a significant opportunity to establish
itself in a market that desperately needs more powerful rockets to
launch today's new generation of heavier communication satellites
such as Orion 3, said Caceres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive news is that Delta 3 didn't blow up again,''
Caceres said. ``Boeing will figure this out and try again another
day...
</P>
<P>
   ``But a window of opportunity was there for Delta 3 to come in
and make some headway. Now, Boeing is back to where it was. They
have gained no ground on their competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal competitors are the French and U.S. defense giant
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In a market once dominated by the United States, France's
Arianespace now launches more than half the world's communications
satellites _ a business that in a few years is expected to be worth
upward of $20 billion annually. U.S. companies have about 30
percent of the market, with the rest divided between Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
   Delta 3 was expected to bring a good chunk of the commercial
business back to the United States, and to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Orion 3 mission, Delta 3 was to fly twice more
this year, and at least six times next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how the latest failure will affect Boeing's
Delta 3 launch manifest. That will be determined by how quickly
investigators can pinpoint what went wrong with the second stage on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage of the new Delta 3 is very similar to the first
stage of Boeing's reliable workhorse Delta 2. But the second-stage
cryogenic engine is new for the Delta 3 program. Built by Pratt &AMP;
Whitney, it uses uses super-cold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The second stage was supposed to ignite twice to place the Orion
3 satellite into an orbit with a high point of 15,969 miles above
the Earth, and a low point of 115 miles. The satellite would then
use its on-board engine to push itself into a permanent orbit
22,300 miles above the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary indications are that the second burn never occurred,
and the Orion 3 was left in an orbit with a high point of about 862
miles and a low point of 98.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Loral's Schwartz told analysts during a conference
that the satellite apparently was a total loss, Hughes engineers on
Wednesday sent a series of commands to the stranded satellite in an
effort to raise the orbit enough so that sunlight can reach the
craft's solar cells and recharge the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   That will give engineers more time to study possible options to
salvage the mission, said Hughes spokeswoman Fran Slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Wednesday the investigation board that will examine
what went wrong with Delta 3 is headed by Dr. Russell Reck,
Boeing's director of engineering technology for Expendable Launch
System in Huntington Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres said he expects the high failure rate of new rockets to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not upgrades. These are new rockets systems,'' he
said. ``Companies today are not going through flight testing
because it's not economically feasible. They want to get into the
market and start making money right away.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hughes has signed nine customers for Delta 3, including
the Orion 3 and Galaxy X missions, said Slimmer, the Hughes
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   No customers have canceled their orders for Delta 3, Slimmer
said Wednesday. But Boeing has not booked any new orders since the
explosion of Delta 3 last August.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining Delta 3 flights that had been scheduled for
later this year were to have carried two of the 12 satellites for a
mobile communications system owned by ICO Global Communications of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The first two ICO satellites are to be launched by Russian
Proton rockets. The third and fifth satellites in the ICO
constellation were to have been launched by Delta 3 this year. In
between those two Delta 3 missions, an Atlas rocket is scheduled to
launch the fourth satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ICO spokesman Joe Tedino said in an interview Wednesday that ICO
has not changed its plans to have Boeing launch satellites 3 and 5.
But he did say the company has ``great flexibility'' to change its
plans and book space on another rocket should the need arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we will be watching closely the information that
comes out of the Boeing investigation,'' he said.

CLIPPERS LOSE FINALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After teaming up on enough grief to require
air-traffic control for circling buzzards, the Clippers and the
Sports Arena called it quits Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ending this relationship as soon as possible was the best excuse
we've heard for not making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a season-ending game with layoff implications, the
Clippers lost most of their cleaning deposit by getting lightly
dusted by the Seattle SuperSonics, 107-105, in front of 15,372.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Clippers (9-41) attempted to behave like a
team that didn't mind smashing a few of those precious lottery
Ping-Pong balls. Behind CBA refugees Tyrone Nesby (a career-high 30
points) and Troy Hudson (19 points, 10 assists), the Clippers
provided some drama after trailing by 16 in the fourth quarter. The
Sonics (24-26), who qualify as lottery trainees, were content to
see if the players who didn't play much this season could have
gotten them into the playoffs if they had played more often.
Ex-UCLA star Don MacLean, who was drafted by the Clippers in 1992
but traded before he could suit up, led Seattle with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   For the home team, emotional impact varied.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who are moving to the Staples Center when the
paint dries, played with passion, but seemed as sentimentally
involved with leaving their old venue as a family checking out of
Motel 6.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go to star forward Maurice Taylor for possible emotional
relevance. What about it, Mo ... any pangs of nostalgia?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Taylor, who scored 20 in the finale, said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but the Clippers are not unanimously thrilled with moving.
Guard Eric Piatkowski, who has spent all five of his pro seasons
playing for the NBA's version of a garage band, does have a soft
spot in his heart for the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was a good place to play,'' Piatkowski
said of the Sports Arena, home to the Clippers for 15 seasons and
254 victories in 564 games. ``It's a pretty good place to watch
basketball. I have some good memories here.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the Clippers vice president of basketball
operations, created positive vibes in the building than anyone
while starring for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are teams that have played in worse arenas than this,''
said Elgin Baylor, the Clippers vice president of basketball
operations, possibly referring to Mel Gibson's Thunderdome crew.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what could be considered a late resurrection, there
haven't been many Clipper teams that struggled as much as this one.
At least the Clips finished this irregular season with a moment or
two to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby, the rookie free agent, checked in with four dunks, with
two of those abetted by lob passes from Hudson. Taylor, who hit a
few bumps on a recent road trip, finished a slick left-to-right
crossover dribble by going Hatfield for a dunk on Seattle rookie
Jelani McCoy. He rocked two more in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Sonics -- seemingly unwilling to go bow to
the getaway-party atmosphere - brought just enough game to avoid
going down in Clipper history.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The Astros made a living off some of the best relievers
in the league last season. But even with Jeff Bagwell at the plate
in the eighth inning of Wednesday's game and the Astros trailing by
a run, things didn't look good with Armando Benitez zipping 96-mph
fastballs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one point, Astros manager Larry Dierker turned to bench coach
Matt Galante and asked, ``What if Benitez could just throw one of
those 91 or 92 mph (pitches) for a strike right now?''
</P>
<P>
   Request granted.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning off Benitez as
the Astros completed an impressive road trip with a 5-4 win over
the New York Mets at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked up (at the radar reading), it was 91,'' Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez (0-1) had allowed just two runs in his first 12 innings
for a Mets bullpen that entered Wednesday as the best in the
majors. Mets relievers were 7-0 with 12 saves and a 2.44 ERA before
Bagwell's home run, his third during the Astros' six-game road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do that every once in a while,'' said Bagwell, who went
2-for-4 with four RBIs. ``Let me tell you, Benitez is probably
going to strike me out more than I'm going to get a home run off of
him. He's very tough. He's not a treat to face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros twice rallied in the game, the latter in a two-run
eighth inning. With the Mets leading 4-3, Benitez walked Bill
Spiers to lead off the inning but got the next two hitters before
Bagwell hit a 1-0 line drive over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell went 8-for-22 with three home runs and seven RBIs during
the road swing, extending his hitting streak to 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second time in seven days Benitez blew an
eighth-inning lead. In a game last week, he allowed two runs to San
Diego before the Mets rallied behind Mike Piazza's game-winning
two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to throw a fastball outside,'' Benitez said. ``I
missed my location, and he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The come-from-behind victory let reliever Jay Powell (2-0) off
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Powell entered in relief of Sean Bergman in the seventh inning
with the score tied at 3. He surrendered an RBI single to Roger
Cedeo and allowed three hits, walked one and hit a batter in 1
innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros clinging to a one-run lead, Billy Wagner
relieved Powell with two runners on and two outs in the eighth.
Wagner struck out all four batters he faced _ 12 of his 15 pitches
were strikes _ for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jay Powell did well,'' Dierker said. ``He's had good
stuff all year, but everything has gone wrong. It's tough for him
because he hasn't had any success, nothing positive or good to look
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell has struggled through his first 10 appearances,
particularly with control of his slider. In 10 innings, he has
given up seven runs, 13 hits and six walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros gained a measure of revenge against the Mets, taking
two of three during the series at Shea Stadium and going 5-1 on a
road trip that also included a stop in Florida. New York took three
of four games last September in Houston, delaying the Astros'
clinching of a second straight National League Central title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it to me and got on me pretty good,'' Wagner said of
home runs he allowed to Brian McRae and Piazza in consecutive games
last September. ``It's an intense game every time we play this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It also served as validation of how the Astros can pull out a
victory against a tough starter, an even stronger bullpen and a
team considered an early favorite to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just hard to beat,'' Dierker said of the Mets. ``We
never get much more than two or three runs off him (starter Bobby
Jones). They got a lot of hits, and we managed to close off some
rallies and leave some runners on base. You can't always do that,
but we did that tonight. That was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few games where we've outhit the other team and
lost. This time, they outhit us (11-8) and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones went seven innings, allowing five hits and three runs
while striking out a season-high eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored twice in the first inning when Craig Biggio
walked and Derek Bell hit a fly ball down the right-field line that
Bobby Bonilla, wearing a brace on his sprained right knee, couldn't
chase down.
</P>
<P>
   It went as a double, and Bagwell followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets answered on Edgardo Alfonzo's RBI double and Piazza's
RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, coming off a complete game in his last start April 30
at Florida, allowed three runs and eight hits in six innings. It
marked the first time in 10 games an Astros starter did not get a
decision. The starting rotation was 7-2 in those nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla gave the Mets a 3-2 lead in the fourth inning with a
long sacrifice fly, and the Astros responded on Biggio's RBI double
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' defense played a role in keeping the Mets off the
scoreboard with three double plays, and Richard Hidalgo made a
pinpoint throw from left field to throw out Rey Ordoez at the plate
to end the fourth inning.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DAYS before the big race, D. Wayne Lukas took pride in showing
visitors a pair of small wooden carvings hanging in the shed row of
his barn at Churchill Downs. A gift from a fan, each artwork
displayed the back of a horse and jockey, and on them had been
hand-painted the names of Lukas' two entries in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is exactly the view I want the other (17) horses to see
at the wire,'' said Lukas, who very nearly got his wish.
Charismatic came barreling up from seventh at the far turn to win,
and Cat Thief wound up third by slightly more than a length.
</P>
<P>
   If a flying Menifee hadn't dodged his way through the field to
wind up second, beaten by a neck, Lukas would have achieved his
improbable, picture-perfect finish. He didn't get his exacta, but a
third victory in five years made a swell consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   The most active of all Kentucky Derby trainers is not among
those campaigning to limit the field to a more convenient number
than the 19 colts who scrimmaged in last week's classic. No one
promised us a rose garden, but the debate goes on: Is this the best
way to showcase racing's premier event?
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is that there were no spills, no serious injuries to
the horses or the plucky little athletes who must manage them. But
when you fill up the track, form and strategy pretty much take a
holiday. Picking a winner brings back memories of the days when the
child who came closest to guessing the number of jelly beans in a
candy store window could collect a bagful on the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great for Bob Baffert and Nick Zito and me,''
Lukas said of the idea of limiting the field to 15 or fewer.
``We're here every year, sometimes with two or more colts. But what
about the guy who only has one, and his trip is once in a
lifetime?''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas may be moved by motives that are entirely altruistic. The
average field for the 125 Kentucky Derbies is 12 and a fraction,
but the trend is clearly pointing to a full house. In five of the
last eight years, there have been 18 or more starters. And guess
what? Charismatic and Thunder Gulch won from the 16th hole, and
Grindstone from No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The other Lukas champion, the filly Winning Colors, had the 11th
position in a field of 17 in 1988. One of three fillies ever to win
the Derby, Winning Colors did it by taking the lead and holding it
wire-to-wire.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to prevailing in this kind of traffic is to find a
lane and hope for a clean ride. It worked just fine for
Charismatic, who stayed wide early and made his move at the top of
the stretch, with a heady ride from Chris Antley.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is on record as favoring a limit of 12 to 14 horses. He
had three chances to become the first trainer to win three Derbies
in a row, but General Challenge, his best bet, was clobbered early,
while Prime Timber and the filly Excellent Meeting had to battle to
wind up fourth and fifth. A victory by General Challenge would have
been the first by a gelding in this race in 71 years, but he never
got untracked, plodding across the line behind 10 others. It was a
dreary day for the horse Baffert had talked up all week. Of course,
being a gelding means he isn't looking forward to his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, who trained two Derby winners, Strike the Gold and Go for
Gin, hasn't yet landed hard on the issue. ``It's the Kentucky
Derby,'' he said. ``There is always the luck factor, and with so
many horses it might be even more so. But what are you going to do,
tell someone they can't run their property?''
</P>
<P>
   Luck was not with Zito's entries, Stephen Got Even and Adonis,
who finished 14th and 17th.
</P>
<P>
   The largest field in Derby history was in 1974, the 100th
anniversary of the spectacle, with Cannonade leading a pack of 23.
</P>
<P>
   Another famous mob scene occurred in 1982, when Gato del Sol ran
last for half a mile, then closed fast to win in a crowd of 19. The
bumping and jostling in the first turn may have affected the
outcome of the Derby in 1987, when War nearly went over the inside
rail, and 1994, when Strodes Creek was hindered by Valiant Nature,
who had been sideswiped by another horse.
</P>
<P>
   War staggered home 13th in a field of 17. Strodes Creek, trained
by Charlie Whittingham, finished second to Go for Gin among 14
colts _ what many believe should be the maximum number of starters.
The first 14 ran out of the main gate Saturday, with the extra five
in the auxiliary gate.
</P>
<P>
   The grand design of Baffert wound up in the trash bin when
Aljabr had to be scratched, moving each colt one spot to the left.
Instead of having Prime Timber on the outside of the main gate,
with room to his right, and General Challenge in the auxiliary,
with space to his left, they were crunched side by side and caught
up in the gang fight at the start.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the railbirds mean when they refer to ``racing
luck.''

ROBERT VICKERS, ARIZONA DEATH ROW LEGEND, EXECUTED
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ariz. _ At 3 p.m. Wednesday the blue curtain opened
inside the death chamber at Arizona State Prison here.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayne Vickers, Death Row's most infamous resident, popped
his head up like a cobra from the gurney and smiled a gap-toothed
smile at the assembled crowd of officials and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, everybody,'' he said with the swagger that would
characterize his death as it did his troubled, violent life.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you later.''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. His microphone was cut off. Still, the watchers
outside the glass could read his lips: ``Time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickers, facing death by injection for the 1992 murder of a
fellow Death Row inmate, looked at his aunt, cousin and a woman he
often referred to as his ``soulmate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you. Don't cry,'' his lips said. ``I'm coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   His aunt's sobs and the hum of the air conditioner were the only
sounds as the crowd filed out of the small, windowless room. The
blue curtain closed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 41, the man who proclaimed himself ``Banzai Bob'' by carving
the Japanese epithet in a victim's flesh had built himself into a
bloody legend inside Arizona's prison sys tem.
</P>
<P>
   His violence, ingenuity and flair for the dramatic became known
even beyond Arizona when he appeared in a HBO special to show how
one can escape from cuffs and chains.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials took no chances. After Vickers finished his
last meal of two green chili burritos, fries with ketchup, vanilla
ice cream, cream soda and one cigarette, they added a special
thumblock, along with handcuffs and straps, to bind him to the
death gurney.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-serving current in mate on Arizona's Death Row,
Vickers amassed a staggering record of mayhem inside the walls of
the state's correctional system.
</P>
<P>
   He was cited for two murders, 158 other major violations,
assaults on 12 corrections officers and some 20 inmates, numerous
threats and about 40 counts of making weapons.
</P>
<P>
   If he regretted any of it, he never said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982 killing, Vickers built a firebomb from hair gel and
an ice-cream carton, then used it to torch fellow murderer Wilmar
``Buster`` Holsinger in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   When a guard asked Vickers if Holsinger was dead, Vickers re
sponded, ``He should be. He's on fire.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Banzai Bob'' started out small - small in age, small in crime.
Sometime before his 11th birthday, court records show, he started
steal ing.
</P>
<P>
   His role model was not hard to find. According to court records,
his father, Harold Vickers, took the boy along on several
burglaries. On some occasions, he used Robert's small size to gain
access to his targets.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the elder Vickers ap parently did little in the way
of parenting. Robert Vickers once told a parole officer that his
mother and father divorced when he was barely a year old.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers, who grew up mostly in the Sunnyslope area of Central
Phoenix, lived with a grandmother until he was 4 years old, then
with his father until age 7. Even then, Vickers said, his father
left him with relatives for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers lived in 18 different foster homes; in one, both Vickers
and his sister were molested by their foster mother, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
   By sixth grade, he was in custody of the state, and spent time
in juvenile corrections facilities at Fort Grant, Alpine and Adobe
Mountain. It was the end of Vickers' formal education.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers' relationship with his mother, Jennie Thompson, was ap
parently no closer. Once, he said, she literally threw her infant
son into the trash. On another occasion, he said, he and his
sister, Brenda, visited their mother while the chil dren were
living with their father.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother feared that Harold Vickers was not coming to
pick them up, he said, Jennie Thompson turned the children over to
child-welfare workers.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Gray, a Tucson attorney who represented Vickers in his
first murder case, said he once inter viewed Vickers' mother and
``she was totally devoid of any kind of emotional connection with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In late February, Vickers' mother committed suicide, said
Camilla Strongin, a Corrections Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said she left a note saying that she was
responsible for her son's actions.
</P>
<P>
   They said Vickers was never told about his mother's suicide.
Prison officials feared that the infamous Death Row inmate might
kill him self.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers was far from infamous when he entered Arizona's adult
prison system in 1977; in fact, he was a relatively small man doing
small-time crime. After amassing a long record of petty juvenile of
fenses, Vickers was sentenced as an adult to three to nine years
impris onment for grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from juvenile custody in 1976, he'd moved to
Fresno, Calif., and stayed there just long enough to run up five
warrants for his arrest for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers came back to the Valley and pulled off 12 burglaries in
13 days, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In one, he pried open the bath room of a Tempe home and stole
$550 of property, including a hand gun and jewelry. He stole $2,000
from another Tempe home that day.
</P>
<P>
   A Tempe police officer, who said that Vickers admitted to 33
Califor nia burglaries, said Vickers, ``be gins every day planning
a burglary much as another individual would attend to a regular
job...If he was out of jail another 100 days he would do another
100 burglaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickers escaped from the Tempe jail a few days later, but was
captured and sent to Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Warden Frank Terry, a guard during those days, remembers
that time as being one of extraordi nary violence at the Florence
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was still a teenager, only about 5 feet, 5 inches and
skinny,'' Terry said. ``He had small-man's syndrome and did what he
felt like he had to do to keep the other inmates away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Terry said, there was Vick ers' ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also saw himself as a legendary killer of gigantic propor
tions,'' Terry said, ``who will be remembered forever along the
lines of John Dillinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickers wasted little time in prepar ing his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   His first murder was of inmate Frank Ponciano, whom Vickers
sought out as his cellmate because Ponciano had a TV. Angered that
Ponciano did not wake him up for lunch and drank his Kool-aid, Vick
ers killed him, then carved - and misspelled - the Japanese war cry
``Bonzai'' in Ponciano's back.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers burned a cigarette on Ponciano's foot to show a guard he
was dead, then said, ``Get this stinking (expletive) out of my
cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickers later told prison psychol ogist Kent Spillman that he
regret ted only one thing about the attack: that he didn't have
enough time to carve a swastika on Ponciano's body.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial for Ponciano's death, Vickers threw a water
pitcher at a prosecutor while his mother was on the stand. He also
fashioned various weapons in his cell and used one to stab a guard.
He later stabbed another. Later, he would attack 10 more.
</P>
<P>
   Like Officer Richard Lockwood. Vickers threw a homemade bomb
which exploded behind him in March 1980. When Lockwood ap proached
him, Vickers kicked him in the groin.
</P>
<P>
   Three months before, Vickers used a ballpoint pen to stab an
officer in the head who was bring ing dinner to his cell. In early
1981, Vickers stabbed yet another officer in the chest with an
8-inch shank while the officer was pouring him a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers also once escaped from death row and climbed atop the
roof of Cellblock 6 through a shaft with another inmate. Vickers
had man aged to short circuit the electronic locking mechanism on
his cell door and left a dummy in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Once atop the compound, how ever, the two realized they had no
place to go. The outside fence was too far away. It was too high to
jump to the ground below.
</P>
<P>
   The two then did a striptease for a woman tower guard who
spotted them before they were caught by other officers rushing to
the roof, said corrections officer Jim Robi deau.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Vickers slipped his restraints while in a visitation
area, dashed down a corridor past startled guards while flinging
homemade ``shanks'' at two inmates in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before, angered about not promptly receiving a
Christmas gift, Vickers threatened to ``kill a pig before Christ
mas...rolling in their blood squeal ing,'' according to prison
records.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers also celebrated the Christmas season that year by ask
ing a guard for a couple .22 caliber rounds so he and another
inmate he called ``Gypsy'' could kill a third inmate they both
detested.
</P>
<P>
   When the guard responded in the negative, Vickers said, ``It
never hurts to ask.'' It was years since Vickers was permitted
access to any electronic equipment. In the past, he'd made weapons
out of typewriter parts, pop-up stereo antennas, television cables
and even by scratching chips from the wall of his cell.
</P>
<P>
   At a prison hearing last Decem ber, officials waived the
necessity of Vicker's presence because of safety concerns. They
also were relieved this week when Vickers decided not to attend his
Tuesday clemency hearing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chronic concern. In 1988, a prison memo warned that
guards had seen Vickers starting to work out with weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be advised,'' it said, ``this behavior is usually the start of
a routine prior to his stabbing some one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone viewed Vickers as a vicious monster. Gray,
Vickers' former attorney, says he holds the state of Arizona
responsible for Ponciano's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in (Vickers') juvenile record of violence,''
Gray said. ``Why did the state put a skinny kid thief in the same
cell with a second-degree murderer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the state also refuse to pay for Bob's mental-health
coun seling when he was transferred to California as a juvenile?''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Spenser, a former inmate who knew Vickers well, said he
definitely needed psychiatric coun seling.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser said Vickers believed that he lived with a pet
alligator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks to him...he sits him on his shoulder. I watched him
with a mirror and he puts that alligator to bed every night at the
foot of the bed,'' Spenser said.
</P>
<P>
   Another inmate, Roy Turrentine, remembers Vickers cutting his
throat with a razor on five occa sions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason that the dude didn't cut himself bad enough to
bleed to death,'' he said, ``was 'cause the only kind of razors we
had out there were the safety razors.''
</P>
<P>
   For sheer brutality, Vickers outdid even himself in his 1982
attack on Holsinger, which also nearly killed a half-dozen other
inmates from smoke inhalation and which forced officials to
evacuate Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers, who was assigned the job of a porter cellblock
attendant, flew into a rage after Holsinger made lewd comments
about a pic ture Vickers was displaying of his 11-year-old niece.
</P>
<P>
   About a minute later, records show, Vickers returned to the
front of Holsinger's cell with his flamma ble concoction. He threw
it in, burning the inmate and igniting a large collection of legal
documents.
</P>
<P>
   later court testimony indicated that Vickers threw a second fire
bomb into Holsinger's cell just make sure.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Vickers asked investi gators, ``Did I do a good
job?...I told them they should have gassed me in December when they
had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Vickers had demanded death. In a
letter the previous year to then-Gov. Bruce Babbitt, he'd written,
``So what's the hold up fella?
</P>
<P>
   ``If ya don't do it soon, I'm gonna draw more blood than your
cheap mops can absorb. I'm a very impatient person, I never did
like waiting. I've got a date with the devil's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Ben Cooper said Vickers had toned down con
siderably in the past 10 years and hasn't been charged with any
violent acts. But DOC records indicate two assaults by Vickers
during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers never lost his violent edge, even near the end.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lopez, a corrections officer who had counseled Vickers on
a daily basis, said Wednesday he was looking in Vickers' cell one
recent morning and angered the con demned man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lopez, I know you're not an evil (expletive) but I'm in an
evil mood,'' Lopez said, recalling the smirk on Vickers' face.
Lopez also said that Vickers had lamented aloud in recent months
that he hadn't assaulted any prison staff members in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   But, always, there was that swag ger.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Vickers gave a prison officer a weapon resem
bling a crossbow that he had crafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised you a rubber band gun some day so here it is,''
Vickers wrote to the officer. ``I call this the cell warrior
g-57...it can go THROUGH the human skull and brains, the tip and
shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the neatly hand-written letter, Vickers asked: ``How's
the family?'' &QL;

JUNIOR PITCHER, TEXAS-ARLINGTON BASEBALL TEAM REDISCOVER SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ To get where he is this season, and to help
get the Texas-Arlington baseball team in the Southland Conference
tournament, Ben Grundhauser had to go back.
</P>
<P>
   He had to try something, anything.
</P>
<P>
   The junior left-handed pitcher was mired in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   His earned-run average held steady near 6.50, and the guy who
had established himself as one of Texas-Arlington's top starters in
fall scrimmages was having trouble getting anybody out.
Texas-Arlington was also off to a poor start, and there was no end
in sight for either.
</P>
<P>
   But look at Grundhauser now. His ERA is 1.94 in his past five
starts.
</P>
<P>
   And look at the Mavericks. They have won 11 of their past 16.
</P>
<P>
   Grundhauser went back to what worked in the fall. As simple as
the whole thing sounds, throwing strikes was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting ahead of hitters and getting the ball over
the plate,'' Grundhauser said. ``Instead of trying to throw the
perfect pitch, I was trying to get people out. The defense has
played great. Everybody, including me, has really gained some
confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Grundhauser throwing like he did in the fall, he's
doing it consistently in crucial conference games down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In his past five starts, Grundhauser has three victories and a
no decision. His complete-game victory Saturday against Nicholls
State clinched Texas-Arlington a spot in the SLC postseason
tournament and gave coach Butch McBroom his 800th collegiate
victory.
</P>
<P>
   McBroom said Grundhauser has helped give the entire team a lift.
After a 1-5 start in the SLC, Texas-Arlington finished 14-13 for
fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington opens the SLC tournament May 15 at 11 a.m.
against Northwestern State in Monroe, La.
</P>
<P>
   Grundhauser might be the starter in that first game, McBroom
said. Coaches will make that decision at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has given us a go-to guy,'' McBroom said. ``When he goes
out there, the guys expect to win. That's something we didn't have
early in the season. We talked to him a while ago and said, `Do
what you were doing in the fall, because you don't have to do any
more than that.' He started to get back to that, and he has really
pitched well.''
</P>
<P>
   What Grundhauser has done for Texas-Arlington lately is what
coaches expected all along.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks recruited him out of Yavapai (Ariz.) College, and
he played last summer for Texas-Arlington assistant coach Clay
Gould in the Jayhawk League. A solid summer season had coaches
excited about him challenging for a spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   A good fall helped solidify his spot in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But Grundhauser said arm soreness early in the spring season and
a few bad starts hurt his confidence and inflated his ERA, which
now stands at 5.09. His turnaround began against Southeastern
Louisiana on March 20 when he went seven innings, allowed six hits
and one run for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm feels good now, and I'm getting my routine down,''
Grundhauser said. ``I expected better out of myself at first. At
least I was able to turn it around in time and start winning, and
the team was able to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Grundhauser reversed it by going back to what was working.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a reason Texas-Arlington is in the SLC tournament
after not qualifying last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing as well as anybody in the league right now, and
we have as good a chance as any team to win that tournament,'' he
said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ A bill that would allow private schools to
compete in district events sanctioned by the University
Interscholastic League won preliminary approval in the Senate
yesterday, but a limit was placed on how many schools would be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, only six private schools in Texas, none
in Tarrant County, would be eligible to participate in
public-school districts in athletic and academic competitions
governed by the UIL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh gosh, everyone is amazed,'' said Dallas Jesuit football
coach Bob Wunderlick, whose school would be eligible to compete in
the UIL. ``There are six steps to a bill and we've gotten past
five. Nobody thought we'd get there. The UIL is very much against
it, but we are pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires the six schools to adhere to the same
standards that the UIL imposes on public schools, and that the
private schools have at least 500 students and be either all-boy or
all-girl academies.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, author of Senate Bill 266, said he
limited the number of schools covered by the measure in order to
ensure that it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 senators present yesterday, 22 supported the bill. A
final vote to send the bill to the House is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we wanted,'' Dallas Jesuit athletic director
Steve Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   UIL officials have been advised not to comment on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said that private schools often are better
funded than public schools and therefore would have access to
superior equipment and facilities and could afford to hire better
coaching staffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Armbrister said the bill is structured to ensure that the
private schools meet the same standards the UIL imposes on public
schools. All the private-school students would have to take the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, meet public schools'
attendance standards, and abide by the state's no-pass, no-play
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Private schools will adhere to the same attendance boundaries as
the nearest public school. In Jesuit's case, it would match
attendance zones with Dallas White. Any student-athlete who enrolls
at Jesuit from outside the boundary will be ineligible to
participate in varsity athletics for one year. The same standard
applies to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said his school would have no problem meeting the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it makes sense to want to join the UIL,'' said Koch,
whose school has 850 students. ``To play a football game, sometimes
we have to go all the way to El Paso to find a school our size.
That's 1,700 miles round trip. That means the kids miss a lot of
study time. I'll bet we pass 1,700 other high schools along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The other schools covered by the bill are Houston Strake Jesuit,
St. Thomas School for boys and St. Agnes School for girls; El Paso
Cathedral for boys; and San Antonio Providence High School for
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Before it becomes law, the bill has two more hurdles to pass
before the legislative session ends May 31. The House must pass it
and then Gov. George W. Bush must sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latter is the easy of the two hurdles left,'' Koch said.

RICE'S BIG NIGHT CARRIES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ From game one to game 1,464, from the days of West
to the days of Magic to the present, with their legacy framed in
six championship banners on the south wall, the 1999 Lakers paid an
appropriate honor Wednesday to the past and to three glorious
decades at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   In the final regular-season home game in Forum history, the
Lakers played near-flawless basketball for a 119-91 rout of the
Pacific Division-champion Portland Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, guaranteed themselves a chance to play in the
32-year-old arena for a while longer: The victory secured
home-court advantage for their best-of-five, first-round playoff
series against the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing was, the Laker with the least time on the Forum
floor seemed the most at home Wednesday. Glen Rice, his former
shooting woes a faint memory, hit a franchise-record-tying eight
3-pointers and made 14 of 20 field goals for a game-high 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rice started early, hitting an open jumper on the Lakers' first
possession of the night, and he found his groove quickly. By
halftime, Rice had a team-leading 15 points. That was just a
prelude.
</P>
<P>
   The real show came in the third quarter, when Rice went 6 for 6
from behind the arc, as the Lakers outscored the Blazers 39-19 and
turned a modest lead into a 27-point rout before the fourth had
even arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Rice could do no wrong, as even off-balance jumpers shot with a
hand in his face found their way through the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, fueled by Rice's hot hand, shot better than 51
percent as a team and thoroughly dominated Portland in every area,
holding the Blazers to 43 percent shooting and out-rebounding them
43-36. Their 119 points was a season-high, and for the second
straight game, the suddenly selfless Lakers dished out 30 assists.
</P>
<P>
   For the Blazers, who long ago wrapped up the Pacific Division
and the No.2 seed in the West, there was little more than pride at
stake. But for the Lakers, there was no shortage of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a win to continue their recent upward trend, to
extend their winning streak to four, to maintain momentum into the
playoffs and, while they were at it, to secure home-court advantage
in their first-round matchup with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The latter point, coach Kurt Rambis tried to downplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether or not anything was on this game, we're
a team that's still trying to develop, come together as a team,
still working on our deficiencies,'' he said. ``It's another
opportunity for us to improve, and that's the way I look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Home-court advantage was certainly a goal, ``but our primary
objective is just to play better basketball, so we're playing our
best basketball, which we are right now, at the end of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only eight days ago that the Lakers seemed to be playing
their worst. Coming off a three-game losing streak, with six losses
in their last eight games, they were playing no defense, running
the offense with zero precision and generally looking like a team
that had ben irreparably damaged by an overdose of change. That,
and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Now they not only look ready for the playoffs, they even _ dare
we say _ appear ready for a championship run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're readier now than we've ever been,'' Rambis said, ``but
we are far from being the team we have the potential to become. But
we are playing better basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who needed 40 points to retake the NBA scoring
lead from Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, finished with 18 points and
conceded the scoring title by mere tenths of a point.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a four-game winning streak, with two routs of
Portland, Rambis is keeping the Lakers' focus on simple day-to-day
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to improve at both ends of the court,'' he said.
``We're a young team that's still coming together and still has
areas to improve upon. It's not just one area. We have the
potential to be better in both areas.''

TEXAS SENATE APPROVES OPENING ASSOCIATION TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>

$500 MILLION IN COCAINE SEIZED NEAR ARIZONA CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix police responding to a burglary call Wednesday
stumbled upon a half-billion dollars worth of Colombian cocaine
about a mile from the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure, the biggest in Phoenix police history and one of
the biggest ever in Arizona, carries an ominous message for the
Valley, according to the local chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix has arrived,'' Special Agent Thomas Raffanello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the Valley is right up there at the top as a
drug trans-shipment point.''
</P>
<P>
   Three patrol officers discovered about one ton of cocaine _
which police said would be worth about $500 million on the street _
about 4 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a call of a burglary in progress this morning at a
house near 25th Avenue and Buckeye,'' Officer Ritche Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers went into the back yard and found two men carrying
boxes out of the house, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped them, I looked into a box, and thought, `Wow!'''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were arrested for trafficking and booked into a
Maricopa County jail, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When Ramos and Officers John Hobbs and Sean Burton figured out
what they had on their hands _ 997 2.2 pound (1 kilo) bricks of
cocaine _ they called for reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the whole squad there and we got the dope out pretty
quickly,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Phoenix Chief Irwin Bakin said, ``This obviously
raises the question, if this is what we just stumble on, how much
more is out there?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got the low-hanging fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Drug Enforcement Bureau Lt. Alton Thiele said, ``We
wouldn't have seen anything like this a few years ago. This clearly
illustrates just what kind of a trans-shipment point we have
become.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon most of the bureau's detectives were
weighing and inventorying the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele said it was as yet unclear who was responsible for
importing the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is going to be very, very angry about this,'' Thiele
said as detectives lugged the cocaine over to scales, weighed it,
then took it to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   The officers found the bricks of cocaine packed in 45 large
cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were packed in Styrofoam, and the boxes looked like they
were ready to be mailed,'' Detective Mike McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   Raffanello said Phoenix ``just seems to be the new place for
trans-shipment.'' He said cocaine typically is moved by airplane
from Colombia into central Mexico, or by ship from Colombia into
the Yucatan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it travels by land north to Arizona ports of entry
such as Nogales or Douglas _ just a few hours' drive from the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here we have a very big international airport, we have
freeways going east and west,'' Raffanello said. ``It's perfect for
trans-shipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffanello, Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt, Maricopa County
Attorney Rick Romley and other local officials recently joined in
asking the federal government to name central Arizona a High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.
</P>
<P>
   Such a designation would bring about $5.8 million yearly to fund
a drug-fighting task force and to distribute funds to federal,
state, county and city law agencies to support existing anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Raffanello and Hurtt said they want the designation to help them
fight the many drug-trafficking organizations that now call the
Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, about 10 such organizations existed locally.
Today, Hurtt said, there are about 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of National Drug Control Policy has yet to announce
whether central Arizona will receive a HIDTA designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly could use the support,'' Raffanello said. ``If
we're practically falling over this amount of drugs in a house near
downtown Phoenix, you've got to wonder how much more is out there
for us to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffanello said the largest drug find in Arizona history was
5,310 kilograms of cocaine found in a Tucson warehouse in 1996. &QL;

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ There are times, even now when those 3-pointers are
falling as soft and pretty as spring snowflakes in the Rockies,
that Michael Dickerson isn't so sure he's going to thrive or even
survive in this league.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA is an in-your-face place, a world of strutting, crowing
and telling the world that you've got game. It's Allen Iverson
never meeting a shot he didn't like, and it's Kevin Garnett shaking
the backboard with a slam dunk and howling like a wolf in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   It's Stephon Marbury forcing the breakup of a playoff contender,
and it's Kobe Bryant leaping from high school to TV spots and
jumping right over the part about fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this place that Rockets rookie Dickerson fits about
as neatly as a hip-hop singer in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. He'd
make a monk seem rowdy, make a library seem like a carnival
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Rockets closed out the regular season with a 95-88
win over the Nuggets and head into the playoffs, any noise they can
make in the next few weeks will only be louder if Dickerson is a
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's athletic, he's talented, and he's just learning about all
of the things he can do on the basketball court,'' said Scottie
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an amazing talent,'' said Charles Barkley. ``And if we're
going to be able to do anything at all in the playoffs, we're going
to have to take full advantage of people like Michael and Scottie.
We know what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers scout sitting courtside at McNichols Arena knows,
too. On back-to-back nights, he has seen Dickerson zap the
Minnesota Timberwolves like the heat in a microwave for 31 points,
then come right back to drill the Nuggets for another 27.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just a roll Dickerson is on. All of a sudden, he's a
boulder hurtling down the side of a mountain. He connected on five
of six from beyond the 3-point line Wednesday. He pulled up off the
dribble and dropped in sweet jumpers around the key. He got out on
the perimeter to play aggressive defense that forced turnovers, and
he streaked to the other end of the floor to finish off fast breaks
with a couple of dunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I'm just feeling good about myself right now,''
Dickerson said. ``The way we're making an effort to get the ball
off the boards and push it up the court in a faster pace definitely
helps me. But all I'm trying to do is fill in the spots where I can
help and make a play if the ball comes to me. I don't know if this
is the real me scoring all these points every night.''
</P>
<P>
   If humility were money, Dickerson would be richer than several
sheiks.
</P>
<P>
   With him, it's not a false front or an aw-shucks manner that
simply covers up for being shy. This is a kid who was an integral
part of a national champion at Arizona, was chosen No. 14 overall
by the Rockets in the 1998 draft, scored in double figures 24 times
this season and yet could still use a confidence boost.
</P>
<P>
   When his shot stopped falling and his offense sagged for several
weeks, the rookie wondered. About what to do to snap out of it.
About whether he would have a long future in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get my doubts at times,'' Dickerson said. ``I miss a few
shots, and I wonder if I should take them. Then I don't take the
shots, and I find that I'm not doing a lot to help the team. I ask
questions. I'm unsure.''
</P>
<P>
   And in those cases, he kneels and prays.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Lord has helped me in so many ways through this season,''
he said. ``I can't tell you the number of times I've gotten down on
my knees and asked for his help, begged for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson has also gotten help from another source _ Eddie
Johnson, who has spent the season on the injured list but still
made his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing with Scottie, Charles and Hakeem because they
are so special,'' Dickerson said. ``But Eddie is the one who is
teaching me how to be a shooter and a scorer in this league. He
talks to me all the time about the things I have to do. He's the
one who is always saying the things to boost my confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if you miss two or three or four shots in a row? A
scorer has to take the next one, knowing it will go in. You know,
that's not part of my natural makeup. But Eddie's pushing me, and I
guess it's paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much of this season's focus on the Big Three of the
Rockets, it is probably appropriate that their fate in the playoffs
will rest a great deal in the hands of Dickerson and Cuttino
Mobley, the rookie backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veterans tell us that it will be rough and tough, you've
got to be strong,'' Dickerson said. ``Actually, I'm kind of
curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they know they will open the playoffs against the Lakers at
the Forum, that they will have to claim at least one road win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we were dealt,'' Dickerson said. ``So we deal with
it, and for me and Cuttino we learn in the process. I'm ready. My
confidence is up.''
</P>
<P>
   At just the right time.
</P>

CELTICS END ON LOSING NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the shortest season in modern NBA history. It
was also the weirdest. If you can accept those facts, you will have
no problem understanding the Celtics' final loss of the spring
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   On Fan Appreciation Night, an evening when players and coaches
greeted the 16,635 fans at the turnstiles and handed out T-shirts,
the Celtics played their longest home game of the year. It took 58
minutes and two overtimes, but the Hornets finally won, 133-129.
Boston's loss was its 31st in 50 games. Depending on whom you ask,
that was somewhere between six and 10 more losses than a lot of
people expected when the season began exactly three months ago
(M.L. Carr did not say what his projected win total was for Rick
Pitino's team).
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing what could have and should have been is what you might
expect at the end of a season. But no one in green and white was
ready for the performances of Brad Miller and Ricky Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew, that's tough,'' Ron Mercer said, after being told the
two rookies combined for 64 points off the bench. ``But I'll take
credit for Ricky Davis. I worked out with him during the summer, so
I have to take credit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel badly if you have never heard of Miller and Davis.
Miller is a 6-foot-11-inch center known primarily for playing on
USA Basketball's bronze-medal team that played in the World
Championships at Athens last summer. Davis is a 6-7 teenage forward
(he's 19) known for . . . being a nice guy?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, both players posted up around, jump shot over, and
dunked on the Celtics until each had 32 points. It's a good thing
the Celtics didn't hand out Hornets media guides before the game
because the fans might have collectively flipped between pages 51
and 68, trying to figure out what made Davis and Miller so special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took them lightly,'' Celtics forward Antoine Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   That is obvious when you look at the stat sheet and check points
off the bench. The Celtics got 45 points from their reserves, 23
from Walker, normally a starter. The Hornets? Try 85 points. Think
of the last time you heard someone say a team got 85 points off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was normal about the game. The Celtics appeared to
be finished late in the fourth. That's when Miller got good
position inside and dunked to make it 104-96. The Celtics tied it
at 109 when Paul Pierce made a 24-foot 3-pointer from the corner.
That would be the score going into the first OT.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were positioned to win at the end of the first
overtime, leading by 3 with 8.1 seconds left. But then another
player who will not appear on an All-Star ballot near you _ Corey
Beck _ made a three to send the game into yet another OT.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't seem familiar until the final minute of the second
overtime. That's when former All-Star Eddie Jones made a terrific
baseline shot _ falling away from the hoop _ to break a 129-all tie
and, essentially, give the Hornets their winning points. The
Celtics got some serious numbers from Pierce (27 points, 9
rebounds, 5 assists), Dana Barros (26 points, 9 assists, 7 rebounds
in 52 minutes) and Mercer (23 points, career-high 10 rebounds). It
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made some shots and Eddie Jones is a bitch to guard
one-on-one,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   He could have had the same lament about the team's season, which
seemed to last much longer than 50 games. It was a season in which
talk-radio callers were offended by the coach, a season in which
Kenny Anderson was told not to make a trip to Florida because of
his behavior, a season in which Walker was booed on a Wednesday
night and given a standing ovation two nights later, and a season
in which the eternally optimistic Pitino said it was his least
enjoyable in two and a half decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media put us on this high pedestal with the Utah Jazz,''
Walker said after his 23-point, 8-rebound, 7-assist night. ``We're
a young team and it's going to take chemistry to get to Utah's
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah may be a stretch; most fans dreamed of a break-even season.
Every Celtic agreed Wednesday night that it was far from that. They
said they tried hard and were encouraged by their late-season
development. But in the end, they found themselves talking about
losing a game because Brad Miller and Ricky Davis beat them. And
for the fourth consecutive season, they wound up skipping the
postseason and talking about next year.

SAD END TO SORRY SEASON FOR SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a place to go down. In Tinseltown. Against
the Clippers. In the seedy old Sports Arena, where Wednesday night
there was a party of all things because the grunge pit is about to
be imploded.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics could not have found a worse place, a worse way to
end their sorry, nutball, playoff-less season _ except that they
showed enough Sonic pride to hold off the typically inept home
team.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a big night out. Even Bill Walton showed up. For one
night, it was almost noble to be an ex-Clipper. And the Sonics had
to be there just to take up space, to try to hold their heads up,
despite the disappointment of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bitter pill,'' coach Paul Westphal said after the
107-105 win.
</P>
<P>
   If there was supposed to be teary sentiment or overtones of
nostalgia over successful Sonic seasons past, you could not find it
among the Sonics. They had a week to digest their postseason-less
plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to watch a playoff game. I could care less who
wins,'' Vin Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no crying in the cramped visitors' locker room, where
Gary Payton munched on sliced melon and Billy Owens checked out his
cell phone and Baker sauntered around in his sweat pants, sipping
on a can of fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   There was no nostalgia on the faded court of the Sports Arena,
where Payton took turns lambasting Vladimir Stepania and Rashard
Lewis for their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   And there was not much nostalgia in the hearts of most veteran
Sonic players _ Detlef Schrempf, Payton and Hersey Hawkins _ who
have to wonder if there is a way to get back to great expectations
in their basketball lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   Those three were the only ones left this season from the team
that took Michael Jordan and the Bulls to Game 6 of the 1996 NBA
Finals, and that was what was so weird Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to play in this game,'' Schrempf said before
the final game of the futile season in which the Sonics find
themselves at the biggest crossroads in perhaps a decade.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time the Sonics played games at the end of the
regular season that meant nothing?
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time this team did not believe itself to be a
legitimate contender, if not for the NBA championship then at least
for the Pacific Division title or the Western Conference crown?
</P>
<P>
   The valley is deep that divides '96 and now.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how long might it take for the Sonics to climb
out?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to shoot the ball better. We need some more help in
the backcourt. We need a stronger inside game both offensively and
defensively. We need to have the core group back in the best shape
of their lives,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sonics president Wally Walker was talking
about not over-reacting. He called upon 1995 as an example, when he
did not break apart a team that had lost in the first round of the
NBA playoffs. The next year the Sonics went to Game 6 of the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the remaining nucleus of that Sonics contender could break
apart anyway. Asked if he was at all sentimental about putting on
his Sonics' jersey for perhaps the last time, Schrempf shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even want to put it on tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fates of Schrempf and Hawkins are a priority issue for the
Sonics this offseason. Schrempf is a player Westphal and the Sonics
are eager to have back. However, Schrempf appears willing to let
the free-agent market come to him, should he decide not to retire.
And if an offer presents itself to go to a contender, especially in
the West, then it would not be a surprise if this stalwart Sonic
takes a one-year deal with the Lakers or San Antonio or Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   If Wednesday was the last time Hawkins suited up in Sonic green
and white, it would be a shame.
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of an NBA professional, Hawkins has been every bit
the heart, soul and conscience of the Sonics since he arrived. But
there is reason to suspect that in the revamping, Hawkins could be
traded, if it was the best way to bring in backcourt help so that
Payton can slide to the off-guard spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very disappointed,'' Hawkins said about his
possible trade.
</P>
<P>
   There are even questions about Baker ... questions he raises
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The power forward who had the worst season of his career will
opt out of his contract this summer. But he refused to say for sure
he will be with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are my first choice but I have to weigh all my options,''
he said, promising that he is too nice a guy to just be talking
tough for negotiation posturing _ and we have to believe him,
especially because there could be part of Baker that would prefer
to play closer to his parents' home in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics have been scouting me since I was in high
school,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, everyone understood that when the Sonics signed Payton
to that well-deserved, long-term deal, the Sonics would become
Payton's team. But Wednesday night, as we took our last look at the
Sonics during this nutball season, the biggest problem that
appeared to be sprouting is that Payton could be the only player of
consequence left on what looks to be a team in transition.

RANGERS RAP RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's nothing wrong with the Red Sox that a little
quality starting pitching won't cure. But the question is: where
will they find some in games Pedro Martinez doesn't pitch?
</P>
<P>
   Veteran righthander Pat Rapp is among those searching for
answers. He recorded only one out Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and was the
victim of a five-run, first-inning assault as the Texas Rangers
routed the Red Sox, 8-3, before 20,906 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the third straight for Boston and sixth in eight
games. The Rangers have won five straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really felt comfortable out there,'' said Rapp. ``I
couldn't control my fastball. I'd get behind on a guy and every
pitch they hit was hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't done it as a starting staff. Unfortunately,
we're putting a lot of pressure on the bullpen, which we weren't
expected to do this early in the season. Hopefully, we can bounce
back.''
</P>
<P>
   After posting his only victory of the year in his previous start
(at Minnesota), Rapp appeared as though he could help stabilize the
rotation. But he came back with the shortest outing of his career.
Granted, the Texas Rangers are not the Minnesota Twins. Before
Wednesday, the Rangers had scored 21 runs in 18 innings against
Rapp when he was with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   They added five runs Wednesday, pushing Rapp's career earned run
average against Texas to 12.90. Rapp walked leadoff man Tom
Goodwin, then following a Mark McLemore strikeout, walked Rusty
Greer. Singles by Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro gave Texas a
2-0 lead. Ivan Rodriguez then upped the ante with a three-run
homer. Two batters later (Todd Zeile single, Lee Stevens walk),
Rapp was done.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by John Wasdin, who was something of a savior to
the Sox bullpen. Wasdin, who was recalled from Pawtucket Tuesday,
gave up two runs over 6 2/3 innings, giving his fellow relievers a
bit of a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough playing catch up,'' said manager Jimy Williams,
``especially when their pitcher (Rick Helling) is throwing well and
they are playing good defense behind him. Rapp pitched good in
Minnesota. But these things happen once in a while. In our case, it
has been in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasdin picked us up. He gave us a chance to get back into it.
But then their pitching and defense just stopped us. We had a
couple of chances early and couldn't score. Then we ran out of
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Nomar Garciaparra hit his first home run of
the season, a two-run shot into the screen in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said he has been working on his mechanics, mostly his
delivery, since spring training. It hasn't always been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed a lot of things since spring,'' said Rapp. ``But
it's just hard to take into a game what you learned during the week
when you've only had a week to change something. Tonight, I didn't
take it into the game. I wasn't comfortable out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said he appreciates Rapp's honesty
in what could be a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not comfortable?,'' said Kerrigan. ``They have a team that
makes you that way. I look at his sheet against them and you find
that Gonzalez is hitting .625, Goodwin .400, Greer .444, McLemore
.500, Pudge Rodriguez .555. I'd feel a little uncomfortable, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is a very good pitcher. But he still has some delivery
issues. Nothing drastic. Nothing major. He's not as good as he
wants to be with first-pitch strikes.''

MESA MUTES CLEVELAND BOO-BIRDS AS M'S ENJOY LATE RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ For Jose Mesa, the boos started well before the
ninth inning Wednesday night, when 42,991 fans dumped jeers on him
in full force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was expecting that,'' Mariners first baseman David
Segui said. ``He said he was hearing it all night in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs Field is ``Home of Baseball's Best Fans'' _ it says so on
top of the visitors dugout _ and the Cleveland Indians have sold
out every game there for almost four years. The fans are giddy for
their team, but they come with an edge. In last year's American
League Championship Series, then-Yankee David Wells complained that
fans mocked his late mother as he warmed up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Wells won that game. And Mesa saved this one, a 6-5 Mariners win
over a team he spent six years with before being traded nine months
after blowing the save in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I like that,'' said M's reliever Jose Paniagua, who
set up Mesa with 22/3 shutout innings. ``If fans do that, it makes
me feel stronger. Mesa told me that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa wasn't saying much of anything afterward, making good on a
pregame promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about Cleveland, or anything else,'' he told a
reporter. ``After I save my 40th game, I'll have a big press
conference. Talk for two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperative? Not Wednesday anyway. Confident? Apparently so.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa started the inning by falling behind Kenny Lofton 2-and-0.
But he came back to strike him out on a forkball, a pitch he has
claimed the Indians never would not let him use. He got the next
out when Segui speared a ground ball by Enrique Wilson, making the
catch behind his head on his glove side after the ball took a bad
hop.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Roberto Alomar followed, but Manny Ramirez lined to
second to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa now is 7-for-7 in save opportunities despite an unsightly
28.93 earned run average in all other games.
</P>
<P>
   M's manager Lou Piniella said he was proud of the way Mesa
handled the environment, but his highest praise was for Paniagua,
who relieved Jeff Fassero (1-3) with the bases loaded and one out
in the sixth. Wilson hit a first-pitch screamer to third baseman
Russ Davis, who caught it and threw to first to double off Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, who last pitched on Saturday, sailed through the next
two innings for his longest outing of the year. He now has a 1.04
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he came here for the last two months of last season,''
Piniella said, ``he's been our most reliable pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero worked 51/3 innings and allowed nine hits _ tying him
for the top spot in the AL in that category with teammate Jamie
Moyer. He was aided by defense in the third inning, when center
fielder Ken Griffey Jr. threw out Wilson trying to score on a
sacrifice fly, and again in the fourth, when shortstop Rafael
Bournigal made a diving grab of a liner by David Justice with a
runner on second.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassero, who allowed two homers to Travis Fryman, won for
the first time this season. The M's won for the third time in a row
when he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``In games that I've pitched, we're 3-4, and two of those losses
definitely could have been wins,'' Fassero said. ``Right now, my
goal is to get the team to .500 in games I pitch and just keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got their runs in typical fashion _ with a trio of
two-run homers, by David Bell and John Mabry in the first inning
and Dan Wilson in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's homer, his ninth of the year, crashed off the front of a
souvenir stand in left field, 421 feet from home plate. He has
never hit 10 balls out of the park in a season; his career-high of
10 was aided by an inside-the-park homer he hit against the M's as
an Indian last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good up there,'' Bell said. ``I always come back to
what Lou and I talked about as far as taking more pitches. I know
it sounds weird, but when you walk more, you're more aggressive.
Your reactions kind of take over. If it's not a good pitch, you
take it. That's the only thing I can say I feel different.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's feelings will have to wait for another day. But if it
truly takes until that 40th save, here's a bulletin: he's on pace
for 42.

SOURCES SAY POLYNICE STINT OVER WITH SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was the last player to arrive at the Sports
Arena, and wielded a handful of tickets when he did.
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice lives here in the offseason. His ties are strong,
so the center had to accommodate people before the Sonics beat the
Los Angeles Clippers 107-105 Wednesday night in their
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   That Polynice curiously did not play for a second straight game
meant more than giving younger players experience.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Polynice plays host before an NBA game, he will
not be in the Sonics' uniform or locker room. The
Post-Intelligencer has learned the Sonics will not re-sign
Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   Though Polynice gave the Sonics rebounds and energy, his
attitude was often considered detrimental, according to team
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice, who signed a one-year contract with the Sonics before
this season, becomes a free agent July 1. Polynice said he will
pursue a winning situation, not money, in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I think I did what they asked me to do,''
Polynice said. ``I think I had a pretty good year. I'd like to come
back. But that's a decision they have to make. I wish we could have
made the playoffs and had a better record; then it would have been
a lot easier to make certain decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment within the team is that the Sonics also will pass on
bringing back forward Aaron Williams, whose constant struggles with
plays cost him. The Sonics will try to move forward Don MacLean in
a trade that could land them a solid point guard Gary Payton
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The team wants to phase Payton in at shooting guard if they can
sign a player who can handle the ball slightly more than half the
game. That would mean bringing Hersey Hawkins off the bench _ a
move Hawkins has already endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to flow better at the two,'' Hawkins said of Payton.
</P>
<P>
   There still is a possibility the Sonics could attempt a trade
involving Hawkins to get a quality point guard or front line
player. It would also rid the team's salary cap of the $8.7million
Hawkins has left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a genius to figure that out,'' said Hawkins,
32. ``When you look at the team, who else can you get something
for. They're not going to get rid of the young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice, though, will be one of the most noticeable absentee
next season.
</P>
<P>
   No one could ever accuse Poly-nice of not knowing his role. He
adequately filled the Sonics' rebounding void at center with 8.9
boards a game.
</P>
<P>
   But his brutally honest remarks have made him expendable.
Polynice's indiscreet comments also made him difficult to live
with, according to insiders. Polynice never questioned game
strategy but, at times, he publicly wondered about coach Paul
Westphal's communication.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice said it was a matter of ``respect'' when Westphal told
him five minutes before the April 18 game at Phoenix that he would
not start. On other occasions, Polynice was unhappy about his
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when he said things that didn't need to be
said,'' one Sonic player said. ``Sometimes when things happen you
just have to accept it and move on. He wasn't always able to do
that. Sometimes it was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unreasonable to believe the Sonics would entrust
rookie Jelani McCoy at center. McCoy turned in aggressive, tough,
sometimes veteran-like performances this season.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Polynice is not a superstar. Therefore, he
was not given much leeway with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Charles Barkley, who are very direct and honest,''
Polynice said. ``So why is it that I can't be honest as well?
Because I don't have the status of a Charles Barkley that means I
have to lie? No. If I'm asked a question, I'll answer it as
honestly as I can. I'm not going to please everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to live my life. There's bigger things than this job.
I'm going to retire in a couple of years. If I have to walk around
saying I lied to somebody or I did something I was against, I'm
going to feel worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, those who brought Polynice aboard felt he lived up
to his reputation. He is good when things go well. But when things
go sour, the rap on Polynice has been his poor attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice said that is an unfair criticism. ``When I'm
interviewed, I'm not going to talk bad about anybody, knock a
teammate or anything like that,'' Polynice said. ``But if I'm asked
a question about what I see, I'm going to be truthful. People have
to respect that. They may not like it. But they have to respect it.
That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked of he would disappointed if he did not return to the
Sonics, Polynice flatly said ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a family to support,'' he said. ``What I would regret
not coming back is not being able to right the wrong as a team. ...
Paul is one of the nicest guys you want to meet. I don't envy Paul
and (team president) Wally Walker at all. This season was tough.''

RICE'S BIG NIGHT CARRIES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ From game one to game 1,464, from the days of West
to the days of Magic to the present, with their legacy framed in
six championship banners on the south wall, the 1999 Lakers paid an
appropriate honor Wednesday to the past and to three glorious
decades at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   In the final regular-season game at the Forum, the Lakers played
near-flawless basketball for a 119-91 rout of the Portland Trail
Blazers _ and in doing so, guaranteed themselves a chance to play
in the venerable arena for a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory secured home-court advantage for their best-of-five,
first-round playoff series which begins Sunday against the Houston
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing was, the Laker with the least time on the Forum
floor seemed to feel the most at home on Wednesday. Glen Rice, his
former shooting woes now a faint memory, hit a
franchise-record-tying eight 3-pointers and made 14 of 20 field
goals to score a season-high 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before, Rice voiced frustration with his role in the
offense. Suddenly, he (begin ital)was(end ital) the offense. And
feeling understandably chipper about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go out and play as well as I did tonight and the
crowd responded the way they do, it's definitely uplifting,'' he
said. ``I just have to keep going out there and doing the things
that I did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's roll started when he hit an 18-foot jumper on the Lakers'
first possession of the night. It was clear his teammates wanted a
more involved Rice as they fed him pass after pass. And Rice repaid
their confidence, scoring 15 first-half points, then exploding for
18 in the third quarter as he made all six 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun. When you have a guy hot like that, you have to
keep milking it,'' he said. ``It was really evident that they were
trying to keep giving the ball to me, and that's what you have to
do when you have a guy hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's third-quarter 3-fest took a modest Laker lead and turned
it into a 27-point margin by the time the fourth quarter had
arrived. Rice could do no wrong, as even off-balance jumpers made
with an opponent's hand in his face found their way through the
net.
</P>
<P>
   It had the Lakers bench hopping and the fans giving Rice a
standing ovation when he checked out of the game in the fourth. Two
months after arriving in a much-debated trade, Rice had won a
symbolic embrace from the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all along that he has to learn to play within
our system and with the guys that we have,'' coach Kurt Rambis
said. ``It's just very nice that it came together for him in the
last game of the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one more possible headache for opponents who already had to
contend with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by Rice's hot hand, the Lakers shot 51.3 percent as a
team and thoroughly dominated Portland in every area, holding the
Blazers to 43 percent shooting and outrebounding them 43-38. The
119 points was a season-high, the margin of victory equaled their
largest this season and for the second straight game, the suddenly
selfless Lakers dished out 30 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight days ago, the Lakers hit their season low point,
losing three straight and six in an eight-game span. They were
playing no defense, running the offense with zero precision and
generally looking like a team that had been irreparably damaged by
an overdose of change. That, and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after closing out the season with four straight wins, all
impressive, the Lakers not only look ready for the playoffs, they
even _ dare we say _ appear ready for a championship run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good going into the playoffs,'' Bryant said, ``but we
have to continue with the same mindset _ that's the mindset of
improving every game and every day. We have to come in and focus,
forget about this game and forget the last four games and get ready
for Houston.''

HAPPILY, STARS' HULL IS ONE OF THE GUYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The makeshift sign hung in Brett Hull's locker
at the Dr Pepper StarCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Soft Hands
</P>
<P>
   1. Liberally apply baby oil to hands.
</P>
<P>
   2. Rub in thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place baby powder on knob of stick.
</P>
<P>
   4. Shoot between pipes for best results.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull took one look at the jab at his lack of scoring, laughed to
himself, and moved on, disappearing behind the black door of the
Stars' locker room and turning himself into just another hockey
player.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice sign, he says. Not just the one placed on his stall
by teammates who gigged him for scoring one point in the first
round of the NHL playoffs. The real sign is that he's becoming more
and more a part of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Hull, 34. ``It's nice to just be one of the
guys. That's what I always wanted, to just be a hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be possible for the next two weeks because the
Stars take on Hull's former team _ the St. Louis Blues _ in Game 1
of a best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series at 7 tonight
at Reunion Arena (Fox Sports Net Southwest and ESPN2).
</P>
<P>
   The story line is too juicy _ former hero returns to face the
team that dumped him. Brett Hull, the mouth that roared, goes back
to St. Louis to take on the team he made famous, to play in the
building he basically built.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull isn't buying that. He's still just one cog in the gear
that is the Stars' hockey machine. He left behind the glory days of
St. Louis last summer when the Blues refused to sign him as a free
agent and he cashed in on a three-year, $17 million deal with the
Stars. But in stepping away from the Blues, Hull also left behind
the media frenzy that followed his every move, the 86-goal season
in 1990-91 that spawned thousands of jersey sales and put his
poster on the bedroom wall of many a young fan in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   This guy was as big as Mark McGwire at one time, and now he
wants to just fade into the background? C'mon, Brett, where's the
golden throat?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is all about `team,''' Hull said. ``There are a lot
of stars, a lot of leaders, there's no one guy, and I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After being the ``one guy'' for 11 seasons, Hull has found his
relocation to Texas refreshing. He has changed his style, changed
his expectations, changed his image. And the second-round playoff
meeting with the Blues illustrates just how much he has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Dallas Star now,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``We've gone through the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first four games of the playoffs, Hull has no goals
and one assist. In St. Louis, they would have been studying his
body chemistry and calling in experts to diagnose his problem. In
Texas, he gets praise for a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well in that first series,'' Hitchcock said. ``He
fought hard for his ice and he earned a lot of scoring chances. He
was responsible defensively and he really played within the game
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, that's all that's required of Hull _ the 13th leading
goal-scorer in league history (586) and a lock for the Hall of Fame
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a different situation for me,'' Hull said. ``The
guys are giving me a little heat because I haven't scored yet. But
the contributions from everybody are more important than the goals
themselves. If a guy like me or Mike Modano isn't doing what
they're supposed to do \Rdefensively\S in the system, everything
breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, the $5.5-million checking winger? It has a strange
sound to those who watched him dazzle St. Louis with spectacular
goal-scoring. But it's what the Stars now require of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a checking winger,'' Hitchcock said. ``His first job on
that line \Rwith Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen)\S is to check the
other team's best line. His next job is to help make sure that his
line outscores that line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Hull would attempt to do that by scoring three
goals while giving up two. Now, he's trying to score one goal while
giving up none. And he's succeeding in the new system. He had 32
goals, including 11 game-winners, and was a plus-19 this season. In
Hitchcock's book, that's more than worth the investment.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, Hull has generated 18 shots and is even in
plus-minus, exactly where the Stars want him to be. Sure, he needs
to score some goals _ that's the second part of his job _ but those
goals have to be a product of playing within the Stars' system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I still see myself as a goal-scorer and the pressure is
always there,'' Hull said. ``But I've been able to temper it now.
Now, I know I can contribute to the team even if I don't score.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Brett, you have to want to score against the Blues, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After going 11 years in St. Louis without advancing past the
second round of the playoffs, that would be a change for the
better.

BOAT SICK ABOUT FATALITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By John Sturbin c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram When they
red-flagged the VisionAire 500 to a halt at Lowe's Motor Speedway,
and the tragic facts surrounding the deaths of three spectators
began to unfold Saturday night, a cold sweat swept over driver
Billy Boat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I got a sick feeling in my stomach,'' Boat said from his
business in Phoenix the other day. ``For me, it hit a little closer
to home. That's because two of my kids were in the grandstands,
sitting with some friends, and we didn't know where they were. As a
parent, I was glad to see my kids after my wife \RAndrea\S went out
and found them. Because you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Boat, 12, and Chad, 7, left the racetrack in Concord,
N.C., with their parents Saturday night, when what was supposed to
have been a grand prelude to the 83rd Indianapolis 500 turned
instead into the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Three fans killed. Eight injured by flying debris hurtled over a
catch fence and into the grandstands. Among the victims was a
9-year-old girl who remains in a North Carolina hospital with brain
and lung injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat, the parent, still is sick to his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to the family and the friends of all the
people involved,'' said Boat, the father of four children. ``All
you can do is just pray for the families. It's a helpless
situation. It's something you never, never really get over.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have followed the IRL since its inception are well
aware of founder Tony George's struggles to build the depth and
strength of series teams, to attract the commitment of corporate
America and to capture the interest of oval-track fans. It has been
a well-intentioned but sometimes agonizingly slow process for a
series featuring 200 mph race cars.
</P>
<P>
   And now this, at a facility that never had witnessed a racing
fatality in its 40-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge blow, definitely something the IRL didn't need at
this point. No series needs it,'' said Boat, who has blossomed into
a star in the fledgling IRL. ``But it's not a problem confined to
the IRL. Even NASCAR has to take a look at it, because they're not
immune from parts flying into the grandstands, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Motor Speedway is, of course, the center of developer
Bruton Smith's Speedway Motorsports Inc., an empire that also
includes Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. LMS president H.A.
``Humpy'' Wheeler and IRL officials are attempting to recreate the
accident that sent a wheel and suspension parts from a three-car
wreck flying over a 15-foot fence and into the Turn 4 grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   The same painstaking process was undertaken at Michigan Speedway
last July, when three fans were killed and six injured by a wheel
and parts that flew off a Champ Car during a CART FedEx Series
event.
</P>
<P>
   Once its investigation is completed, SMI officials might opt to
uniformly raise the catch fence heights at all its racetracks. Or
there might be no change implemented before the series visits TMS
for the first of two races in June. Because how high is high
enough, and presumably safe enough, for you and the members of your
family?
</P>
<P>
   Or Billy Boat's children?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the answer, I'd offer my suggestion,'' Boat said. ``I
don't know if there is an answer. But you have to make the fans
feel safe. They are there to have a good time and enjoy the races.
They shouldn't have to worry about their safety.''
SPOTLIGHT ON ... Wallace works overtime on revised Ford Taurus
To mixed reviews among its NASCAR Winston Cup teams, Chevrolet
officials have delayed the debut of the racing version of the 2000
Monte Carlo until the beginning of next season.
</P>
<P>
   That will keep the new Monte Carlo on a level playing field with
the updated 2000 Ford Taurus, which Cup star Rusty Wallace
confirmed is being developed by Penske Racing South.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car is in our shop right now,'' said Wallace, driver of
the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford. ``All it's going to be is a new nose
and new tail. It's not going to be a radical design or anything.
And I don't think you're going to see a performance change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shocks a lot of people because they say, `Why would you
change a car if you're not going to make it run faster?' The
Chevrolet guys are already saying, `Oh my God, they're coming out
with a bullet.' That's not the case. We're coming out with a car
that has to have a facial change because of the new design of the
2000 Taurus. So, the headlights will look a little bit different
and the taillights will look a little bit different. But trust me,
NASCAR is all over this car, governing everything that gets done on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Monte Carlo was supposed to have made its debut at
Lowe's Motor Speedway this month. But NASCAR officials asked
Chevrolet to make additional aerodynamic changes to the new car's
roof line and rear deck after tests conducted at the
Lockheed-Martin wind tunnel in Marietta, Ga., in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Ritter, general manager of marketing for Chevrolet, said
those changes would have made the new MC uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said NASCAR is simply trying to maintain competitive
balance. Through 10 races, Ford teams have a 70-67 lead over
Chevrolet, which has a 5-4 advantage over Ford in victories.
Pontiac has scored one victory, with John Andretti, and 53 points _
and has three drivers ranked in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want that balance to go away,'' said Wallace, who
has won a race and is seventh in points. ``I think that's one of
the reasons they haven't approved the Monte Carlo to run this year.
I think they want to look at both cars, so when they start the year
2000, they're sure they've got these cars as close as they can.''
QUICK HITS Little E Cup testing Reigning NASCAR Busch Grand
National champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. officially launched his
Winston Cup testing career at Lowe's Motor Speedway Wednesday
before an audience that included 13 television cameras and
approximately 50 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, the son of seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, is
scheduled to make his Cup debut May 30 in the Coca-Cola 600. He was
among General Motors drivers participating in a two-day test at the
1.5-mile trioval in Concord, N.C. Little E's team brought two
Chevrolet Monte Carlos to his home track, but one car developed a
malfunction that led to a carburetor fire.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, 24, logged only three laps of practice in the second
car before afternoon showers ended the session after approximately
50 minutes.
CART's Blundell injured CART FedEx Series regular Mark Blundell was
reported in fair condition at St. Louis University Hospital after
suffering apparent head injuries in a crash while testing at
Gateway International Raceway in Madison, Ill., Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Blundell was injured when his No. 18 Motorola
Reynard/Mercedes-Benz spun and crashed into a wall at the 1.27-mile
oval after a gear selection problem.
</P>
<P>
   Blundell was taken to St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Granite
City, Ill., where CAT scans were normal. He was transferred to St.
Louis University Hospital for more tests.
Elliott gets McNews NASCAR's Most Popular Driver is hungry for a
new primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott's association with McDonald's will end after the
2000 season, with the fast-food retailer opting for a new agreement
with California-based Precision Preparation Inc. PPI owner Cal
Wells III is scheduled to field a NASCAR Busch Grand National team
next season, before eventually graduating to Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   PPI has hired Tim Wardlaw as program manager and Joe Garone, who
recently left Elliott's No. 94 Ford Taurus Cup team, as crew chief.
Wells, who has fielded Toyota's primary engine development team in
the CART FedEx Series since 1995, plans to run Taurus sheet metal
in the BGN series.
Burton tops ballot Winston Cup points-leader Jeff Burton has
captured first-quarter voting for Driver of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Burton collected 10 first-place votes and 102 points from a
panel of 12 motorsports journalists, including this reporter. Jeff
Gordon, the three-time and reigning Cup champion and Driver of the
Year recipient, was second with 48 points. Eight-time NHRA Funny
Car champion John Force, the 1996 award-winner, received the other
first-place votes and was third with 41 points.
Last words ``In a way, I'm certainly pleased to see the Monte Carlo
delayed a little bit. Because I felt like it was going to be better
than what they \RChevrolet\S had, and what they had was pretty
good.''

PLAYOFF DISAPPOINTMENT FOR STARS: THEY CAN'T HATE THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ Hate had happened.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And this wasn't a case of somebody juicing the hype. In
describing the relationship between his Stars and the Phoenix
Coyotes, hype-free Ken Hitchcock freely used ``unhealthy hate.''
</P>
<P>
   What a jaw-for-a-jaw playoff series it was gonna be. Even Jeremy
Roenick, wearing a contraption that looked like a bobsledders
helmet, had his mouth wired and ready.
</P>
<P>
   Except in their eagerness to deliver ``Roenick's Revenge,'' upon
the Stars, the talkative prairie mutts had a sudden memory lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Up three games to one in its first-round Stanley Cup series,
Phoenix flat forgot how to beat St. Louis. Not even Roenick making
his dramatic (at least in Phoenix it was considered dramatic)
return for Game 7, could prevent Choke City.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the Coyotes became NHL poster boys for the
Heimlich maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   As of tonight, the Blues will be showing up at Reunion Arena,
probably as surprised as the Stars that they are actually here.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to work up a good case of hate against St. Louis?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way,'' Brett Hull said Wednesday at StarCenter.
``This is a team that's just like us _ a hard working hockey club
without a lot of frills.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he once spent a career bleeding blue, Hull certainly knows
these people. But defensemen Richard Matvichuk showed a grin when
asked if there was any reason to strongly dislike the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it a couple of shifts on the ice \Rtonight\S,'' he
answered, ``and something will probably turn up.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably.
</P>
<P>
   Round Two of the playoffs presents a classic case of bad
news-good news for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, there was a desire to play Phoenix, which had nothing
to do with the potential for emotional and physical fireworks. The
Blues are more skilled, therefore more dangerous, particularly if
Grant Fuhr is ``on'' in goal. St. Louis' uneven regular season was
caused mainly by inconsistency and injuries involving Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Stars' good side is the Blues going seven games with
Phoenix, and then into overtime to win the series in Game 7. Plus,
with Colorado-Detroit considered the premier playoff matchup, the
league office and TV combined to give St. Louis the shortest
possible recovery time from one series to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, of course, haven't played in eight days, which might
bring up concerns of rust, except ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've been telling people is although the Edmonton series
will go down as a sweep in the books, I have never been involved in
a tougher one,'' said Hull. ``Every shift was a physical battle.
Those four games were harder on you than any seven-game series I've
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rust settling in, there was healing. And until the
Blues came back on Phoenix, this last week was spent preparing for
another physical and mental showdown against the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been the \RDerian\S Hatcher-Roenick series,
but this will be all about Brett and his deep roots in St. Louis,''
said Matvichuk. ``One way or the other, there was going to be a
focal point in this second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Brett will handle that business in the right way, and that
should leave us with just a tough series of hockey to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, in fact, made a point Wednesday of meeting head-on with
the media horde. ``You can let it be a pain in the butt by trying
to run from it and refusing to talk about it, but why?'' said Hull.
``Why not get all the questions asked and answered to start with,
and then go about your business.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mike Keenan were still in St. Louis as coach-GM, then Hull
would be involved in verbal warfare, but those days are long gone.
Kinda like the Phoenix Coyotes now being history.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a different Game 7 winner out west Tuesday night,
Matvichuk would never have been describing tonight's opponent as
``a team that plays with heart and class.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis will show up for every game and throw everything
they've got at us,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That means good special teams, particularly on the power play,
and a pair of defensemen in Al MacInnis and Chris Pronger who
perform like ball-handling point guards. Against the Stars' hard
forecheck, MacInnis and Pronger are a perfect duo.
</P>
<P>
   And how could you hate a team where the leading scorer, Pavol
Demitra, shaves his head?
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not Phoenix, but this will be tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Stars in six, as Roenick sits in Phoenix, sucking up his meals
through a straw.

BLUES EXPECT KEEPING FOCUS WILL BE THEIR EDGE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Floyd 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Forget conventional wisdom that says a well-rested
Stars bunch will quickly dispose of a drained bunch from St. Louis
in Round 2 of the NHL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Blues winger Tony Twist has a varying theory before Game 1
begins at 7 tonight at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   He figures an exhausted Blues crew, less than 48 hours removed
from a Game 7, series-clinching, overtime victory against Phoenix,
has an advantage against a well-rested Stars crew that last played
a game April 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a lot easier to prepare for a hockey game playing
hockey than playing golf,'' Twist said. ``There is a lot to be said
for rest, but there is a lot to be said for never losing focus. I
think coming off a Game 7 like that, the way we did _ Game 7,
overtime, goal OT winner _ I think we're ready. We're focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe just a little tired, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, maybe,'' Twist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were just beat,'' Blues winger Kelly Chase said. ``Any
time the guys on the plane are too tired to play cards, you know
they are tired.''
</P>
<P>
   When Blues center Pierre Turgeon finally ended Game 7 with a
deflection of a Ricard Persson shot, Tuesday was pretty close to
being Wednesday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday already had arrived in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only one up in the house at the time,'' Stars winger
Pat Verbeek said of a game that ended at 1 a.m. locally. ``I can't
imagine why.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure a couple of Stars players like Verbeek stayed awake,
propped up on a bunch of pillows with a remote control in one hand
and a icy cool beverage in the other watching Blues players sweat
and fret and hustle just to get to Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' invitation already had been extended _ eight days
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We earned the right to have a layoff,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``But it only does us good if we use it. We've got
to play with very strong energy. We've got to play with a lot of
enthusiasm, and we've got to hopefully set the tempo as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Blues coach Joel Quenneville also stressed a need to set a tone
early on. And he believes that playing a game so recently benefits
his group in trying to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He said this despite catching a flight from Phoenix that arrived
at D/FW Airport at around 5 a.m., despite few Blues getting more
than six hours sleep, despite only a couple of Blues being up for a
skate a day before a big series begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of that emotion, I think we just needed some time
away to get our thoughts and change channels,'' Quenneville said.
``I think we got the emotion high right now. Hopefully, that can
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   To rest or not to rest? That seems to be the question.
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Well, that isn't quite clear yet.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, players best prepare for a hockey game by playing a
draining game of hockey. Maybe, players best prepare for a hockey
game by playing a relaxing game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, both in a case of Blues goalie Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   ``So does Fuhrsy,'' Chase responded when presented with Twist's
theory that the Stars might be flat from playing a lot of golf.
``He's played golf every day and has been playing a lot of hockey,
and he's been playing great.'' nn

HELLING HELPS RANGERS QUIET RED SOX (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAULS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates expects a confrontation
someday on the mound with right-hander Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   The manager will stroll slowly to the mound, signal the bullpen
for the appropriate reliever and demand the ball from a defiant
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said before that we're going to get in a fight one of
these days when I go to the mound to make a pitching change,''
Oates said. ``I couldn't believe he let go of the ball when I went
to get it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates expected that confrontation during the seventh inning of
the Rangers' 8-3 victory Wednesday night against the Boston Red Sox
at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Oates summoned left-hander Mike Venafro from the bullpen to
replace Helling, who did not want to surrender the ball with the
Rangers' 7-1 lead intact. In fact, the manager's presence stunned
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his decision,'' said Helling, who emphasized his
reverence for the manager's authority. ``I respect that, but it's
frustrating. I thought tonight was a good night to get out there
and throw 120 pitches and build some endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he doesn't feel comfortable with me out there pitching
with a 7-1 lead. That's the way I looked at it. Just because we've
got eight guys out there in the bullpen doesn't mean he has to use
them. Let us pitch through some of these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates acknowledged his appreciation for Helling's
competitiveness, but the game dictated a change, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the time to make the move there,'' Oates said. ``If I
don't, the lead might not be there. He had thrown 100 pitches. How
many more pitches is he going to throw? So, why let him face those
left-handed hitters?''
</P>
<P>
   Helling surrendered a leadoff double to Jose Offerman, but
recorded the seventh inning's first out with a fly ball off the bat
of John Valentin. That brought Reggie Jefferson, Boston's
left-handed-hitting designated hiter, to the plate and Oates from
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said before that we're going to get in a fight one of
these days when I go to the mound to make a pitching change,''
Oates said. ``I couldn't believe he let go of the ball when I went
to get it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who earned his third victory in as many starts, did not
want to leave despite pitching around trouble most of the evening.
However, pitching around trouble served Helling's purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched like it was a 7-0 game,'' he said. ``I threw a lot
of first-pitch fastballs to a good fastball-hitting team. A 7-0
game is different than a 1-0 game. All you want to do is get outs
and get your team off the field as fast as you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make them hit the ball early in the count. If they hit it,
they hit it. Then, I'll start pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   That plan served Helling (3-3) well after the Rangers' five-run
first and two-run second innings. Catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who drove
in only three runs during the previous 16 games since his
9-runs-batted-in performance April 13 in Seattle, matched that
production with his first-inning at-bat against right-hander Pat
Rapp (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's three-run home run highlighted the Rangers'
first-inning explosion, and his second-inning single provided
Helling a seven-run advantage. Helling pitched out of a
first-inning, bases-loaded jam and stranded eight runners through
six innings before eventually being removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind him wanting to pitch and not wanting to come out
of there,'' Oates said. ``I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' decision, though, might prompt Helling to alter his
approach the next time the Rangers provide him a comfortable lead
so he can pitch deeper into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we're not capable,'' Helling said. ``Maybe
I'll pitch differently the next time. Maybe I'll pitch like it's a
1-0 game, but that's the competitor in me. I want to be out there
all the time.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gunning for pop culture
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is much not to like in American popular culture: rock
groups that celebrate the morbid and gruesome, the virtual gore of
video games, vicious and misogynist rap, Internet sites that incite
hate in the name of everything from abortion opposition to White
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And more. And, if we only knew, probably worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the understandable urge to discover what probably will elude
us, we search in the media mishmash for incitements that will
explain why two youths armed like guerrillas came to murder 13 in
their Colorado school and kill themselves as if that were just
about the neatest way you could end such a swell party.
</P>
<P>
   But cause and effect are tricky critters. If the two boys dwelt
in some of the creepier precincts of our cultural space, did what
they find there dispose them to massacre or was it the other way
around, that their predisposition led them to those catacombs? Even
if the first, would either have acted if they had not, out of
actuarial accident, brought together whatever improbable
combination of aggressions and vulnerabilities it was that led both
to their act and their end?
</P>
<P>
   Millions of young Americans live in the same culture and never
go off. European and Japanese youths have much the same fads, icons
and entertainments as American youth do. One of the rock bands the
Columbine shooters followed was German, as of course was the old
Nazism one of the boys toyed with. Is the source of American youth
violence then German culture? Just to ask the question is to see it
as silly.
</P>
<P>
   We do have some soul-searching to do, but scapegoats are no
substitute for understanding. Our Prilgrim ancestors thought
witchcraft threatened Salem's youth _ and fixed it! The Senate held
hearings in 1954 on the ruin comic books were making of America's
young, today's fretful elders.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions to ask _ about, for instance, high schools
of two and three thousand students, where an adolescent life is
created beyond the sight and reach of the schools' overwhelmed
adults. And what fault may lie with the national taste for
disagreeableness _ in everything from hyperpartisanship to venomous
talk radio to TV's raging heads? Could adult models be more
implicated than the rock bands that, after all, are mostly just
lurid piffle?
</P>
<P>
   For all the evil influence popular culture is supposed to be
having on the young _ and the odd schoolyard slayings of the past
18 months aside _ youth violence overall has been declining through
the '90s, as have teen pregnancy, birth, abortion. Grades are up, a
little. Our kids are not doing badly.
</P>
<P>
   That they are not is no reason to be blithe about what in pop
culture, on its very face, is amiss. Free speech works best when
its issues are joined, so the good, on its merits, can drive off
the bad. The First Amendment requires no default to the pernicious;
indeed, it obliges us to open opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Columbine's tragedy, so plainly an exception to the rule,
calls for no rolling purges. We owe the dead and hurt our sober
thought, not, of all things, a hunt for prejudged and easy prey.

  THE SOURCE BEHIND THE FORCE: `STAR WARS' PRODUCER RICK McCALLUM  
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., MAY 17, 1999) 
 Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Ray Park as
Darth Maul in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even Darth Vader needed a Grand Moff Tarkin.
 &HT;    Somebody's got to keep the details covered while The Big Guy is
communing with the Force. And for ```Star Wars'' mastermind George
Lucas, that man is Rick McCallum.
 &HT;    McCallum is a longtime Lucasfilm top gun and producer of ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' which blasts into theaters on May 19.
His job may not be as eye-catching as some, but it's important.
 &HT;    ``At the end of the day, I am responsible for making sure that
whatever George Lucas wants George Lucas gets, and that he's going
to get it in the most cost-effective, efficient way,'' McCallum
says. ``That allows us to do things our way, but without the huge,
huge risks that a normal big film of this size would have.
 &HT;    ``I make that happen.''
 &HT;    Signing stars and unknowns alike to three-picture deals? No
problem. Overseeing the creation of a staggering 2,000-plus
computer-enhanced shots? Easy. Schlepping 70 tons of equipment and
hundreds of cast and crew from London to Tunisia to Italy and back
again? Not to worry.
 &HT;    ``George gave us the tools and the money to be able to make the
movie we wanted to make,'' the 45-year-old McCallum says by
telephone from Skywalker Ranch in San Rafael, Calif. ``If it
doesn't work, it's nobody else's fault.
 &HT;    ``That's kind of terrifying and, at the same time, very
exhilarating.''
 &HT;    The result of Lucas' largesse is a $115 million sci-fi
extravaganza that many observers predict will be one of the most
lucrative films of all time. The growing buzz has had even McCallum
sitting up and taking notice, ever since the re-release last year
of the spiffed-up versions of the original trilogy.
 &HT;    ``I was amazed by the success of the special editions,'' the
producer says, ``and I could see that there was a real need for
something truly exciting.
 &HT;    ``We don't have that experience in films anymore,'' he adds.
``You have it at rock concerts and basketball or football games,
but you don't get the cultural, collective experience very often in
films anymore.
 &HT;    ``When you do, it's very powerful.''
 &HT;    McCallum promises that this will be no ordinary movie. For one
thing, the story of young Anakin Skywalker _ the future Darth Vader
_ will test its viewers' minds and imaginations, not just their
adrenaline glands.
 &HT;    ``This is primarily the setting up of the whole saga,'' McCallum
says of what is to be the first in a prequel trilogy. ``It's a very
complicated story, in terms of the politics and the nature of the
world that surrounds this event of Anakin being discovered.
 &HT;    ``We also visit three different planets _ Courascan, Tatooine
and a new one called Naboo,'' he says. ``So there is a lot of
information, and every frame of the film is very, very dense with
characters and subplots and creatures.
 &HT;    ``The film will surprise a lot of people,'' he says coyly. ``I
think `The Phantom Menace' is much more complex than people will be
expecting. It has a lot of humor _ more than people would associate
with a film set in the `Star Wars' universe.
 &HT;    ```The Phantom Menace' is just a fun ride,'' he adds. ``It's
meant to be enjoyed. I'm so happy, and I know George is very happy
... We're there. We're so close we can taste it.''
 &HT;    Lucas' frame of mind has been talked about for years. He hadn't
directed a film since ``Star Wars'' (1977), and there were reports
that he hated directing, had some kind of phobia about it and would
never direct again.
 &HT;    Now, however, he is said to have enjoyed ``Phantom Menace'' so
much that he's also planning to direct its sequel.
 &HT;    ``I've been working with George for 10 years,'' McCallum says.
``Ever since I've known him, he's been a consummate filmmaker. He
loves to edit, he loves to photograph. Writing is painful for him _
it's laboriously long for him.
 &HT;    ``I know he enjoyed shooting `The Phantom Menace,' which is why
I know he wants to direct the second one,'' the producer says.
``But I think his real joy comes in post-production, when he edits.
That's what he loves _ he loves to be able to spend the time
manipulating the images.
 &HT;    ``And I think, for him, it's not so much a maturing as a finding
of freedom _ he's finally able to have the technology to tell the
stories he always wanted to tell.''
 &HT;    That's assuming that it's ready in time. As of the end of April,
McCallum and company were racing the clock, putting the final
touches on ``Phantom Menace.'' There was a lot still to be done,
and Lucas' having advanced the film's opening date from its
original May 21 didn't help.
 &HT;    McCallum was confident that they'd finish in time, however. They
had to _ on May 21, he's scheduled to begin pre-production on
``Star Wars: Episode II.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Dreamy Saturdays with Mother
</P>
<P>
   ATTN: Mother's Day editors
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Brooking
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   When you're the only girl in a family with five brothers,
finding time for that mother-daughter bonding takes some creative
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Creative thinking must have been one of my mother's specialties.
</P>
<P>
   With six children to raise and a husband long gone, she somehow
managed to stretch both her time and resources so that, looking
back now to our childhood, we could say, ``Yes, we had our
Dreamsville.''
</P>
<P>
   I lived for those Saturday afternoons when Mother had squirreled
away enough coins to send my five brothers to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the neighbors must have wondered why I didn't go, too.
They couldn't have known that a Saturday afternoon alone with
Mother was my special treat.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, for a purchase totaling the grand sum of $2,
Margrave's Drug Store in Paris, Texas, would deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and I were both avid readers, and we both suffered severe
cases of sweet tooth, so you can guess what our order consisted of.
</P>
<P>
   We'd pile pillows to make our nests at each end of the sofa and
with our feet tucked up and the chocolate bars within easy reach,
we'd devour the true romance magazines that let us glimpse into the
lives of beautiful women and handsome men.
</P>
<P>
   They would, we knew to be a fact, live happily ever after in
their perfect houses with their perfect children.
</P>
<P>
   And if they could, then, some day, so could I.
</P>
<P>
   During my lifetime I've read just about everything from the
world's great classics to the current best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a box of Godiva chocolates on the side could make them
equal the memory of one Saturday afternoon sharing with my mother
nickel candy bars and 25-cent romance magazines.

   1. WHO NEEDS WAR CORRESPONDENTS? For reasons that often have
little to do with journalism, it can be surprisingly difficult to
maintain a commitment to honest and courageous reporting while
trying to cover certain wars, writes Christiane Amanpour, chief
international correspondent for CNN. (This commentary is adapted
from her address to the Freedom Forum in New York on April 13.)
1,500 words. 2. CAN THE BRAIN BE REPROGRAMMED TO REDUCE PAIN?
Recent research indicates that pain is a much more complex process
than was once thought. For many years, pain was considered a
relatively simple sensation generated by pain receptors in damaged
tissue and sent, more or less unchanged, directly to the brain. New
research, however, indicates that many factors - including our
emotions and intellect - can alter how our nervous systems process
pain. By learning how to manipulate these factors, researchers say,
it may be possible to change the way we experience pain and reduce
its impact on our lives. By Michael McCarthy. From The Lancet News
Service. 1,000 words. 3. THE ONION Celebrating its 11th year on
paper, its third as the Web's leading source of satire, and its
first as an out-of-control pop icon, The Onion may be vulgar,
insensitive, sexist, racist, or even on occasion offensive, but
unlike its Web rivals, it is funny. But for those poor people who
mistake them for real news, Onion stories often have a bitter tang.
By Liesl Schillinger. From Wired magazine. 2,500 words. (N/A
Japan.)

   A. MORE GAIN, LESS PAIN Mammograms reveal lumps in breasts but
only a painful biopsy can prove if a lump is benign or cancerous. A
new device from the U.S. could avoid the need for many biopsies. By

IN AUSTIN, TEXAS There are countries that can be reflected in
cities which at first sight have nothing to do with them. You place
the city in front of a mirror and suddenly the country just
appears. That's what happens with Austin, the capital of Texas. In
a secret, subliminal sort of way, that city is Argentina. The
similarity probably began in September 1961, when Jorge Luis Borges
was invited by the University of Texas to give a poetry seminar. By
Tomas Eloy Martinez. 1,000 words.

BEYOND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION In the wake of affirmative action,
campuses in California are managing to maintain diversity without
racial set-asides. This will satisfy neither liberals nor
conservatives, but it's looking a lot like the future. By James
Traub. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (8,300 words)
+ edited article available.

BITTER HARVEST : THE ORGAN SNATCHING URBAN LEGENDS Many urban
legends are harmless, such as stories of microwaved poodles and
giant alligators lurking in sewers. Others, however, can have
serious consequences. The organ-snatching urban legend and its
variants have been taken seriously in some places and caused real
harm. Rumours, urban legends and misinformation can easily lead to
disaster and it serves us all to subject them to sceptical inquiry,
writes Benjamin Radford. From Skeptical Inquirer Magazine. 3,500

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HOW TO EAT PORK OVER KOSOVO
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than likely, the folks who edit the newspaper
where these words appear work under a budget for gathering the
news. They usually do not go to their publisher seeking extra funds
each time a news event occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way the federal government works. When air
war broke out in the Balkans, President Clinton promptly asked
Congress for an emergency grant of $6 billion to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution limits the role of the legislative branch in
the conduct of foreign policy. Still, the founders gave Congress
sole charge of the public purse, thereby offering the legislators a
way to get their oar in, should they be so disposed.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans dislike what they call ``Clinton's war'' with
Yugoslavia so much that they passed a bill last month to block the
use of U.S. ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with that negative outlook, it would be only natural
for the House Appropriations Committee to grind down Clinton's $6
billion request. Instead, the panel saw fit to vote $12.9 billion
in ``emergency'' funds.
</P>
<P>
   That action did not sit well with Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin,
the ranking Democrat on the panel, who said: ``Frankly, I find it
mind-boggling that some of the same (Republican) members who
yesterday voted against the operation will today here now vote to
more than double the amount of spending that the president has
asked for to conduct those operations. I think that is
spectacularly inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Obey knows how the game is played. The federal budget is in
surplus. In part, that's due to tight overall budget caps, which
include Pentagon outlays. House Republicans have pledged to keep
those caps intact. But the ``emergency'' Kosovo money isn't
covered.
</P>
<P>
   And that lets the Republicans out of their box. It lets the
Pentagon generals do an end run around the White House. It lets
their defense industry pals talk up Pentagon wish lists on Capitol
Hill, even as they sign over their fat campaign checks to the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way you get, say, two new tank wash parks built
in Germany, at $8 million a pop from taxpayers' wallets, as a
product of the Kosovo ``emergency.'' A spotless Sherman tank here
and there and soon you're talking serious money. All in all, the
House panel would spend $222.5 million more on ``overseas
contingencies'' than Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   Says Obey: ``I do not believe that we should be using something
as serious as the war in order to simply make a lot of head room
for somebody's pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at the big picture: Since the start of the Persian Gulf
war, which coincided, more or less, with the end of the Cold War,
the nation has spent $3.2 trillion to meet its military needs.
Current estimates call for another $1.8 trillion in U.S. military
spending between 1999 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Where has all that money gone? Where will it go?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not exactly cheap to fly a B-2 a third of the way
around the world, and back again, to drop its 16-bomb payload. Each
such mission costs the taxpayers some $12 million per payload. And
then, of course, the bombers need to be washed after they return to
their U.S. base from the skies over Yugoslavia.

   1. WHO NEEDS WAR CORRESPONDENTS? For reasons that often have
little to do with journalism, it can be surprisingly difficult to
maintain a commitment to honest and courageous reporting while
trying to cover certain wars, writes Christiane Amanpour, chief
international correspondent for CNN. (This commentary is adapted
from her address to the Freedom Forum in New York on April 13.)
1,500 words. 2. CAN THE BRAIN BE REPROGRAMMED TO REDUCE PAIN?
Recent research indicates that pain is a much more complex process
than was once thought. For many years, pain was considered a
relatively simple sensation generated by pain receptors in damaged
tissue and sent, more or less unchanged, directly to the brain. New
research, however, indicates that many factors - including our
emotions and intellect - can alter how our nervous systems process
pain. By learning how to manipulate these factors, researchers say,
it may be possible to change the way we experience pain and reduce
its impact on our lives. By Michael McCarthy. From The Lancet News
Service. 1,000 words. 3. THE ONION Celebrating its 11th year on
paper, its third as the Web's leading source of satire, and its
first as an out-of-control pop icon, The Onion may be vulgar,
insensitive, sexist, racist, or even on occasion offensive, but
unlike its Web rivals, it is funny. But for those poor people who
mistake them for real news, Onion stories often have a bitter tang.
By Liesl Schillinger. From Wired magazine. 2,500 words. (N/A
Japan.)

   A. MORE GAIN, LESS PAIN Mammograms reveal lumps in breasts but
only a painful biopsy can prove if a lump is benign or cancerous. A
new device from the U.S. could avoid the need for many biopsies. By
Kurt Kleiner. 500 words. B. CROSSWORD WIZARD First computers learnt
how to defeat people at chess and now they can even take us on at
solving crossword puzzles - and sometimes win. By Jonathan Beard.
800 words. C. DEATH BY FIRE Did fires lit by the first Australians
finish off the large animals that once roamed that continent?
Sharon Levy investigates a controversial new theory. 3,000 words.
D. CRASH COURSE Crippled combat aircraft should soon stand a better
chance of making it back to base, thanks to a novel neural network
that has just passed its first major test. A software co-pilot can
rapidly learn to fly a damaged plane. E. LOST FOR WORDS Dyslexia
seems to be caused by a breakdown in the way sensory nerves develop
in the fetal brain, reports Julie Clayton. Could the mother's
immune system be to blame? 2,000 words. F. FIRM FORECAST Managing
the ups and downs of everyday life has always been a nightmare for
chiefs of disaster insurance companies and senior stockbrokers.
Now, a generation of virtual humans could put the prediction
business on a sound footing. By John Casti. 3,000 words. 5. BORGES
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS There are countries that can be reflected in
cities which at first sight have nothing to do with them. You place
the city in front of a mirror and suddenly the country just
appears. That's what happens with Austin, the capital of Texas. In
a secret, subliminal sort of way, that city is Argentina. The
similarity probably began in September 1961, when Jorge Luis Borges
was invited by the University of Texas to give a poetry seminar. By
Tomas Eloy Martinez. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
BEYOND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION In the wake of affirmative action,
campuses in California are managing to maintain diversity without
racial set-asides. This will satisfy neither liberals nor
conservatives, but it's looking a lot like the future. By James
Traub. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (8,300 words)
+ edited article available.

BITTER HARVEST : THE ORGAN SNATCHING URBAN LEGENDS Many urban
legends are harmless, such as stories of microwaved poodles and
giant alligators lurking in sewers. Others, however, can have
serious consequences. The organ-snatching urban legend and its
variants have been taken seriously in some places and caused real
harm. Rumours, urban legends and misinformation can easily lead to
disaster and it serves us all to subject them to sceptical inquiry,
writes Benjamin Radford. From Skeptical Inquirer Magazine. 3,500
words. Please fax to Paris 33.1.47.42.80.44 or 33.1.47.42.18.81 I

   If you thought reproducing sheep and mice was a leap ahead, you
won't believe what the Japanese have in mind: cloning a woolly
mammoth that last walked the earth during it's heyday in the
Pleistocene Epoch. This bizarre quest may sound unbelievable, but
there is no science to deny the viability of the idea. The only
catch: finding a small bit of well-preserved mammoth tissue
containing normal DNA. To what lengths will the Japanese team go to
realize their cloning dream?

   Blended wines, such as those cheerfully thrown together by
Californians, may turn out to be top-notch, but to a Frenchman they
will lack something special _ terrior. Terrior, a vineyard's
particular combination of dirt, rock and exposure to sunlight may
leave an indelible mark on wine. Something, naturally, French
vintners have always known, but scientists are just beginning to
understand.

   If you thought reproducing sheep and mice was a leap ahead, you
won't believe what the Japanese have in mind: cloning a woolly
mammoth that last walked the earth during it's heyday in the
Pleistocene Epoch. This bizarre quest may sound unbelievable, but
there is no science to deny the viability of the idea. The only
catch: finding a small bit of well-preserved mammoth tissue
containing normal DNA. To what lengths will the Japanese team go to
realize their cloning dream?

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his

happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

 &HT;    Painful puns will leave you groaning
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ This is going to hurt you more than it is
me.
</P>
<P>
   I have another set of painful puns sent via the Internet, which
is an explosive new medium that appears to me to have two main
purposes:
</P>
<P>
   It allows the transmission of bad jokes at speeds far faster
than Henny Youngman could deliver his one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   It is a way for young people barely old enough to vote to make
obscene amounts of lucre by starting Internet-related companies
that have stock values larger than the gross national product of
most Third Bloc countries _ all the while losing millions of
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   So here goes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hangover: The wrath of grapes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Income Tax: Capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   _ A used car is not always what it's jacked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sects! Sects! Sects!'' said the first monk to the second.
``Is that all you think about?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Two silkworms were in a race. They ended up in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   _ To my sweetheart: My cooking's gotten better since I fondue.
</P>
<P>
   _ A robber broke into the police station and stole all the
toilet seats, and the police didn't have anything to go on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Middle age: When actions creak louder than words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Egotist: One who is me-deep in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused his dentist's
Novocaine during root canal work? He wanted to transcend dental
medication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you hear about the woman who started dating rakes and fell
on hard tines?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why won't melons elope in Las Vegas? They cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   _ What do Christmas and a crab on the beach have in common? They
both involve sandy claws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Archeologist: A man whose career lies in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kleptomaniac: One who can't help himself from helping himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you hear about the snake who gave birth to a bouncing baby
boa?
</P>
<P>
   _ Once I got angry at the chef of an Italian restaurant, so I
gave him a pizza my mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fish secretary lodged herself in a pipe and could no
longer type. Her doctor said, ``This is a clear case of 'Carp in
tunnel' syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A friend of mine who commutes to work every day through the
Lincoln Tunnel with a bunch of co-workers recently complained about
what a pain it was. I told him that he may have a bad case of ``car
pool tunnel syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   _ California smog test: Can UCLA?
</P>
<P>
   _ How did the pig with laryngitis feel? Dis-gruntled.
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman has twins and she gives them up for adoption. One goes
to Egypt and is named Amal by the couple that adopts him. The other
goes to Mexico and is named Juan by his new parents. Years later,
Juan makes contact with his biological mother. He sends her a
picture of himself. She tells her husband that she wishes she also
had a picture of her other son. Her husband responds, ``But they're
twins. If you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along, here's what happens if you combine certain
breeds of dogs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pointer + Setter: Poinsetter, a traditional Christmas pet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kerry Blue Terrier + Skye Terrier: Blue Skye, a dog for
visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Great Pyrenees + Dachshund: Pyradachs, a puzzling breed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pekingese + Lhasa Apso: Peekasso, an abstract dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ Irish Water Spaniel + English Springer Spaniel: Irish
Springer, a dog fresh and clean as a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Labrador Retriever + Curly Coated Retriever: Lab Coat
Retriever, the choice of research scientists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newfoundland + Basset Hound: Newfound Asset Hound, a dog for
financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrier + Bulldog: Terribull, a dog that makes awful mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bloodhound + Labrador: Blabador, a dog that barks incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Malamute + Pointer: Moot Point, owned by....oh, well, it
doesn't matter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deerhound + Terrier: Derriere, a dog that's true to the end.

 &HT;    Real uses for familiar tools
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ At one time or another, most every man has
thought of himself as a pretty good auto mechanic. It's only after
disaster upon disaster that it becomes clear that the vast majority
of us shouldn't come anywhere close to a raised hood.
</P>
<P>
   So for those of us who have rounded off more than our share of
bolt heads, here are some relevant definitions that were shared
with me via e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   Hammer: Originally employed as a weapon of war, the hammer
nowadays is used as a kind of divining rod to locate expensive
parts not far from the object you are trying to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic's knife: Used to open and slice through the contents of
cardboard cartons delivered to your front door; works particularly
well on boxes containing seats and other soft leather goods.
</P>
<P>
   Electric hand drill: Normally used for spinning steel pop rivets
in their holes until you die of old age, but it also works great
for drilling mounting holes in fenders just above the brake line
that goes to the rear wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Pliers: Used to round off bolt heads.
</P>
<P>
   Hacksaw: One of a family of cutting tools built on the Ouija
board principle. It transforms human energy into a crooked,
unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence its
course, the more dismal your future becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Vise-Grips: Used to round off bolt heads. If nothing else is
available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat
to the palm of your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Oxyacetylene torch: Used almost entirely for lighting various
flammable objects in your garage on fire. Also handy for igniting
the grease inside a brake drum you're trying to get the bearing
race out of.
</P>
<P>
   Drill press: A tall upright machine useful for suddenly
snatching flat metal bar stock out of your hands so that it smacks
you in the chest and flings your beer across the room, splattering
it against that freshly painted part you were drying.
</P>
<P>
   Wire wheel: Cleans rust off old bolts and then throws them
somewhere under the workbench with the speed of light. Also removes
fingerprint whorls and hard-earned guitar calluses in about the
time it takes you to say, ``Ouc....''
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic floor jack: Used for lowering a vehicle to the ground
after you have installed your new front disk brake setup, trapping
the jack handle firmly under the front fender.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-foot long pine 2X4: Used for levering a vehicle upward off
a hydraulic jack.
</P>
<P>
   Tweezers: A tool for removing wood splinters.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: Tool for calling your neighbor to see if he has another
hydraulic floor jack.
</P>
<P>
   E-Z Out bolt and stud extractor: A tool that snaps off in bolt
holes and is 10 times harder than any known drill bit.
</P>
<P>
   Timing light: A stroboscopic instrument for illuminating grease
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Two-ton hydraulic engine hoist: A handy tool for testing the
tensile strength of ground straps and brake lines you may have
forgotten to disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Battery electrolyte tester: A handy tool for transferring
sulfuric acid from a car battery to the inside of your toolbox
after determining that your battery is dead as a doornail, just as
you thought.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation metal snips: See hacksaw.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble light: The mechanic's own tanning booth. Sometimes
called a drop light, it is a good source of vitamin D, ``the
sunshine vitamin,'' which is not otherwise found under vehicles at
night. Health benefits aside, it's main purpose is to consume
40-watt light bulbs at about the same rate that 105-mm howitzer
shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the Battle
of the Bulge. More often dark than light, its name is somewhat
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips screwdriver: Normally used to stab the lids of
old-style paper-and-tin oil cans and splash oil on your shirt; can
also be used, as the name implies, to round off Phillips screw
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Air compressor: A machine that takes energy produced in a
coal-burning power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into
compressed air that travels by hose to a impact wrench that grips
rusty bolts last tightened 40 years ago by someone in Detroit, and
rounds them off.
</P>
<P>
   Pry bar: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip
or bracket you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part.
</P>
<P>
   Hose cutter: A tool used to cut hoses one-half inch too short.

 &HT;    There's always someone to blame
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As much as Austin preens about being different,
the miserable turnout in Saturday's council elections pretty much
tracked the apathy that greeted local elections statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Texans who stoutly maintain they want to vote on every office
from county surveyor to police chief _ in some communities _ passed
up a chance to cast ballots for mayors as well as school board and
city council members. Not to be outdone by their cousins in Dallas
or San Angelo or Round Rock or San Marcos, Austinites showed that
they could be as apathetic as the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   However, ladies and gentlemen, I submit that candidates in those
other communities don't have near the panache that Austin
candidates do. Our City Council candidates have a certain
indefinable quality about them that sets them apart and they
maintain that sense of style, even in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   There are many contenders, but I'm naming Place 1 candidate Chad
Crow as winner of the Stylish Loser crown for this year's council
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Previous winners have been those who blamed their loss on people
being happy (so, therefore, only those who were mad at her voted)
and the losing mayoral candidate who congratulated his opponent,
this newspaper, on election night.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things I collect are excuses and alibis. You never
know when you're going to need one, and they are fun to swap. In
any event, Crow had a doozy for not getting into a runoff with
incumbent Daryl Slusher.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release delivered electronically on Monday, Crow had
this to say: ``Crow felt the key to making a runoff relied more on
Marcos DeLeon's success than his own. 'Normally, 28 percent is
enough for a runoff when you've got six people in a particular
race. But we needed Marcos to take quite a few votes from Slusher
and it just didn't happen. It's disappointing but I know he was
working with a very limited budget, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   I've been around the world and to the Tom Green County Fat Stock
Show and Rodeo and I've never seen one like that. It's a Hall of
Famer.
</P>
<P>
   A loser will usually blame the press or society or good weather
or bad weather or endorsements or even say that voters were
misinformed or misled.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, however, do we find a defeated candidate with the
creativity to shift the blame to another loser. Moreover, Crow
deftly hijacked and modified the standard excuse Democrats deploy
when they lose: ``Low Hispanic turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   My man Chad Crow may not have won the race, but he won the alibi
derby going away.

 &HT;    How does your garden grow? With the right tools, of course
 &HT;    By Diana Blowers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Many gardeners have a favorite tool. Sometimes
it's the old hoe passed dow n from Grandpa. Other times it's a
newfangled gadget such as the Weasel or Claw. Often it is simply a
quality-made version of an old standby.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are a die-hard gardener or simply sprucing up the
landscape, the tools you use help determine how easy you get the
job done.
</P>
<P>
   Hoes, rakes, spades, shovels, loppers, saws and pruners continue
to be gardening staples. However, garden centers, hardware stores
and tool catalogs are filled with many variations on each one, as
well as with new tools to do old jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Both those who sell them and those who use them tend to agree
that the first tool-buying issue is to buy the highest quality one
you can afford. A high-quality tool will be around to pass on to
the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   The choices are many, but your challenge is to discover that
tool you will soon learn you can't do without. T
</P>
<P>
   Felco pruners
</P>
<P>
   Several good pruners are on the market, but the Felco brand
seems to be the standard by which all others are measured. They
come in several sizes and styles, including left-handed models. A
Felco 7 model features a rotating handle to reduce wrist fatigue.
Regardless of the brand, by-pass pruners, those where the blades
by-pass each other like a pair of scissors, should be used for soft
plant material to avoid crushing the stems. The anvil-type pruners,
those where a blade cuts on a flat plate, should only be used when
only with cutting hard wood.
</P>
<P>
   Fork
</P>
<P>
   Many experts prefer the one-piece construction of aluminum
alloy, which doesn't bend under tough garden use.
</P>
<P>
   Trowel
</P>
<P>
   Considered among the basic staples for most gardeners, along
with the fork. They are used in cultivating small patches of soil
and planting of small plants.
</P>
<P>
   Dibble
</P>
<P>
   You can't find a much simpler tool than the dibble, also called
a dibber. Its sole purpose is to poke holes. The point is plunged
into the ground, the dibble is wiggled around and you have a hole
ready for planting seeds, small seedlings or little bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Auger
</P>
<P>
   Bulb planting becomes one of the easiest jobs in the garden when
you attach an auger to a household power drill. The resulting hole
is perfect for bulb planting and could also be used for planting
small
</P>
<P>
   plants.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Weasel
</P>
<P>
   The bladed wheels of this tool rotate crosswise, creating a
scissors-like action that breaks up soil and uproots weeds. It
comes with a short and a long handle and the blades are detachable
so the tool can work between rows of varying widths and around
plants in tight places.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomic rakes, hoes and shovels
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically designed handles add a new dimension to old garden
standbys. The longer, curved handles allow the user to stay in an
upright position, allowing for proper leverage while reducing
bending and stooping.
</P>
<P>
   Claw
</P>
<P>
   This is a newer tool that many gardeners swear they can't do
without. It can replace the hoe and the shovel as it cultivates
around plants, uproots weeds, digs holes and mixes in fertilizers
or peat moss. All of this is done as the gardener stands upright
and simply makes a half turn of the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Spade
</P>
<P>
   Spades come in a variety of shapes to meet a variety of needs.
This is one of several available with a narrow, long head. Helpful
when digging up plants or planting new ones in an established
perennial bed, it allows the gardener to work in a relatively small
space without disturbing nearby plants.
</P>
<P>
   Hand cultivator
</P>
<P>
   When planting, this two-sided hand tool can be invaluable when
trying to penetrate the hard crust of clay soil. Once the plants
are established, it is helpful in cultivating in spaces too small
for just about any other tool.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffle hoe
</P>
<P>
   This hoe, which resembles the stirrup on a saddle, is also
called an action hoe or an oscillating hoe. Its blade moves back
and forth slightly as the hoe is pushed or pulled. Its sharp,
double-edged blade acts as a cultivator, weeder and edging tool.
The back-and-forth motion cuts both ways, snipping weeds off at the
ground without disturbing the soil or the roots of the surrounding
plants.

 &HT;    Hair jewelry is a girl's best friend
 &HT;    By Jeanne Claire van Ryzin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Messalina, wife of Roman Emperor Claudius I,
fancied tying her hair in a red or purple band. Queen Elizabeth I
started the Renaissance rage of wearing wigs (she had hundreds _
mostly red-haired) adorned with bright jewels, pearls, and other
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   English women of the 19th century favored large gilt hair pins
with balloon-like tops to keep their towering hair styles in place.
Combs with gold-beaded edging were popular for decoration. So were
feathers and ostrich plumes. Queen Victoria tolerated these plumes
_ maybe _ but only the white ones. In 1879, she ordered that all
plumes must be worn in full sight lest any offending colored plumes
be hidden amongst a woman's curls.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1910s, dancer Irene Castle (who with her husband and
dance partner, Vernon, popularized the scandalous tango in the
United States) scandalously bobbed her hair. Castle used a headband
to hold her chic, short cut in place. Away with those unwieldy
Victorian hairpins. The flapper era had dawned.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, much to her (very Catholic) mother's dismay,
bobbed her hair when she was a young woman in the 1920s. But
instead of a headband, my grandmother favored holding her hair back
with barrettes and combs. All the better to dance in.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when my grandmother was well past her flapper years, she
still swept her hair off her face with beautiful barrettes and
combs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic look,'' she always said as she scraped the
metal prong of a barrette across my scalp.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother preferred heavy barrettes made of brushed metal
or imitation tortoise shell. And while I loved to finger these when
I explored her scented dresser drawers, I liked tiny plastic
barrettes in primary colors; those didn't hurt and pull.
</P>
<P>
   Barrettes failed me the year I mimicked Olympic gymnast Olga
Korbut in my back yard, so I switched to elastic ponytail holders.
High school in the late 1970s brought a fascination with combs and
barrettes _ jeweled ones, shiny ones, feathered ones. It was a
brief romantic renaissance with 1940s hairstyles (or so I thought)
as I yearned for an elegant adult look.
</P>
<P>
   College began a decade of short hair. Yet the cheap Chinese
lacquer box of my barrettes and combs followed me. It refused to
disappear, surfacing again and again during every move. When my
hair neared shoulder length a few years back, the lacquer box, with
all its contents, magically re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, my 3-year-old niece arrived for a visit from New
York. From her plastic backpack she produced a handful of
neon-colored scrunchies. ``I want a ponytail,'' she insisted. I
dutifully swept her soft, fine hair into a ponytail, yet I thought,
how nice a tortoise-shell barrette or comb would be. Or perhaps a
red band, a bright jewel, a white plume.

 &HT;    Backyard remembrance of a devoted climber
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Dog years are a rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   Seven to one human year? Six to one? However it shakes down,
it's unfair. Dogs spend so much of their time waiting against the
human clock. For overtime worked, they should get at least time and
a half.
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what else is unfair _ that someone has to be the
adult when a pet dies. Someone has to do the pronouncing, and the
arrangements, and must soothe a young mourner, when that someone
would rather have his own hair ruffled, have refuge in a mom's
apron, have Flower back. Unfair.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what kind of dog Flower was, part retriever, part
everything. She was a doctor's thesis in forensic pedigree. Heck,
we might be blood relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She got her name from the swoosh of white on her black forehead,
like Bambi's skunk friend.
</P>
<P>
   At 11, she was old by dog years, an injustice sufficient unto
itself to make a young man cry. We got her tiny at the Waco Human
Society Animal Shelter. She was a handful even as a spoonful. It
didn't take much growing on her part to demonstrate the house was
too small.
</P>
<P>
   The yard was big. It became hers. And it was almost no time,
maybe 30 seconds there, before she showed off a talent that would
become preoccupation of mine. The dog could climb.
</P>
<P>
   The standard fence or gate did not contain her. And when I used
chicken wire to extend it she would find gaps without fail.
</P>
<P>
   She would never go far, always ending up back on the driveway to
do what she did in back: wait.
</P>
<P>
   For a short time, a chain to the mulberry tree was my grudging
answer. Then another dog entered the picture, a shepherd-mix stray
we named Tramp. He also found the same escape routes. Finally I
subdivided the yard with 6-feet-high fencing. We named it Fort
Flower.
</P>
<P>
   Tramp and Flower were quite a pair. Siblings of circumstance.
Mutt and Mutt.
</P>
<P>
   Suckers that we are, our pet population grew two years ago with
Layla, a collie we rescued in the Denny's parking lot just yards
from death by interstate. She spent two nights waiting to be
claimed at the animal shelter. Not a second more.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining three dogs from a lawn chair is an art form. The
human body has only two hands. I got adept at the group-pet, my
hands working the crowd like a ginsu chef.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I had only two dogs to stroke. It feels like I have
too many hands.
</P>
<P>
   Son Robert was Flower's contemporary. Both were babies at the
same time. Unfair: Dogs got the jump on running and jumping. Then
it seems that just as the little boy acquires colt legs, the dog is
slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   We buried Flower just outside the fence beside the house. It was
getting dark. Fireflies lent their green lanterns. We mused that
the climber in Flower might have made the leap into one of those
little electric bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the dogs for signs of mourning. They were beyond
detection. And whatever he felt, a dog's got work to do. Tramp's
job always has been to ward off moonbeams and announce the arrival
of breezes in the bushes. Flower was the sentinel who commonly had
a ratty old rag in her mouth at my appearance, demonstrating her
readiness to protect. Layla keeps June bugs in line and watches the
tree line for squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   After Flower had been laid to rest, I thudded into the lawn
chair for a group stroke. It was brief. Layla noticed a firefly
invading the far reaches of the yard. They both took off.
</P>
<P>
   Good help like this is hard to find.

   TRAVEL-CAROLINA _ GRAND STRAND, S.C. _ When you think of South
Carolina's Grand Strand, the first place that comes to mind is
booming Myrtle Beach. But we eschew the neon for nature, exploring
the rivers and saltwater marshes that once supported rice
plantations along the fertile coast. We take a cruise on the
Waccamaw River, sail on Winyah Bay, take a Carolina Jeep Safari
tour along the coast and an excursion with Capt. Dick's Saltwater
Marsh Explorer. We stay in nature-based B&AMP;B inns far from the beach
hi-rises. (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   HAIR-JEWELRY _ Messalina, wife of Roman Emperor Claudius I,
fancied tying her hair in a red or purple band. Queen Elizabeth I
started the Renaissance rage of wearing wigs (she had hundreds _
mostly red-haired) adorned with bright jewels, pearls, and other
ornaments. English women of the 19th century favored large gilt
hair pins with balloon-like tops to keep their towering hair styles
in place. Combs with gold-beaded edging were popular for
decoration. So were feathers and ostrich plumes. Queen Victoria
tolerated these plumes _ maybe _but only the white ones. In 1879,
she ordered that all plumes must be worn in full sight lest any
offending colored plumes be hidden amongst a woman's curls. In the
1910s, dancer Irene Castle (who with her husband and dance partner,
Vernon, popularized the scandalous tango in the United States)
scandalously bobbed her hair. Castle used a headband to hold her
chic short cut in place. Away with those unwieldy Victorian
hairpins. The flapper era had dawned. My grandmother, much to her
(very Catholic) mother's dismay, bobbed her hair when she was a
young woman in the 1920s. But instead of a headband, my grandmother
favored holding her hair back with barrettes and combs. All the
better to dance in. (van Ryzin, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED

   BOOKS-SECRETYANKEES _ As it turns out, Miss Pittypat's shocked
words in ``Gone With The Wind'' were an understatement. Union
troops were closing in on the city, and her words suggest Atlanta
was a united city. Not so, says UGA professor Thomas Dyer in a new
book, ``Secret Yankees,'' just published by Johns Hopkins
University and getting some national attention. Yanks'd been here
for years, and actively helped the Union. It's taken two decades of
research, starting with an old diary in the UGA archives, but
Dyer's found that Atlanta was crawling with Union sympathizers and
spies. Historians praise the scholarship because it took a dogged
investigation to find out that Atlanta's population wasn't as
unified as Gone With The Wind has led most folks to believe.

Anger and The Dance of Intimacy. ``A particular mother can behave

serial killer or even get straight A's. (Dayton Daily News). 28.

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Anyone who remembers high school Latin knows
that time flies. Stewart Brand would like to slow it down _ or,
rather, expand our consciousness of it so that we are concerned
less about the end of a millennium and more about what might be
called the eternal present. ``The Clock of the Long Now'' is an
anti-millennial book in the sense that it argues for a
reconsideration of how we understand past, present and future.

   FILMS-MUMMIES _ Universal Pictures has been dying to resurrect
one of its classic horror franchises. The Mummy was the last
Universal monster left from the studio's horror movie heyday in the
1930s and '40s. The latest incarnation opens today, starring
Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Arnold Vosloo. Its storyline is
similar to the Karloff original. But the $80 million update's path
to the screen was as slow as the somnambulistic Mummy itself. Plus

   BOOKS-SECRETYANKEES _ As it turns out, Miss Pittypat's shocked
words in ``Gone With The Wind'' were an understatement. Union
troops were closing in on the city, and her words suggest Atlanta
was a united city. Not so, says UGA professor Thomas Dyer in a new
book, ``Secret Yankees,'' just published by Johns Hopkins
University and getting some national attention. Yanks'd been here
for years, and actively helped the Union. It's taken two decades of
research, starting with an old diary in the UGA archives, but
Dyer's found that Atlanta was crawling with Union sympathizers and
spies. Historians praise the scholarship because it took a dogged
investigation to find out that Atlanta's population wasn't as
unified as Gone With The Wind has led most folks to believe.

<P>
   In the battle for the hotly contested title of International
Moron of the Year, two heavyweight contenders stand out.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Austrian writer Peter Handke, who has astonished even
his work's most fervent admirers by a series of impassioned
apologies for the genocidal regime of Slobodan Milosevic, and who,
during a recent visit to Belgrade, received the Order of the
Serbian Knight for his propaganda services.
</P>
<P>
   Handke's previous idiocies include the suggestion that
Sarajevo's Muslims regularly massacred themselves and then blamed
the Serbs and his denial of the genocide carried out by Serbs at
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Now he likens the NATO aerial bombardment to the alien invasion
in the movie ``Mars Attacks!'' And then, foolishly mixing his
metaphors, he compares the Serbs' sufferings to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   His current rival in world-class folly is the movie star
Charlton Heston. As president of the U.S. National Rifle
Association, Heston's response to the massacre of innocents
recently perpetrated by young Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., is a masterpiece of the
moronic. Heston thinks America should arm its teachers and seems to
believe that schools would be safer if staff had the power to gun
down the children in their charge.
</P>
<P>
   I will not draw glib parallels between NATO's aerial
bombardments and the Colorado killings. No, the larger violence did
not breed the lesser. Nor should too much be read into the
accidental echo between Milosevic's Hitlerian tendencies and the
lethal celebration of Hitler's birthday by the so-called
``Trenchcoat Mafia'' or the even more eerie assonance between the
video-game mentality of the Colorado killers and the real-life
aerial videos the NATO publicists show us every day.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of the war, let's agree, too, that it's OK to feel
ambiguous about the confused, changing-policy-on-the-hoof manner of
the NATO action. One minute we're told Milosevic's savage
retaliatory assault on Kosovo couldn't have been foreseen; the next
minute we hear that it should have been. Or again: we're not going
to use ground troops. -- On second thought, maybe we are.
</P>
<P>
   And our war aims? Strictly limited; we seek only to create a
safe haven to which the Kosovar refugees can return. -- No, no,
we're going to march into Belgrade and get Milosevic, we're not
making that old Saddam mistake again!
</P>
<P>
   To object to vacillation and contradiction is not, however, the
same thing as Handke's half-crazy, half-cynical fellow-travelling
with evil. The moral justification for NATO's intervention is the
humanitarian disaster we see on our televisions every night, and to
blame NATO for the plight of the refugees is to absolve the Serb
army of its crimes. It needs to be said again and again: The people
to blame for death and terror are those who commit terrorism and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   And in the matter of the Colorado killings, let us agree that
guns aren't the sole cause of the horror. The killers learned how
to make pipe-bombs on the Internet, and got their trenchcoats from
a Leonardo DiCaprio movie, and learned to put a low value on human
life from -- whom? Their parents? Marilyn Manson? The Goths?
</P>
<P>
   Which is not at all to adopt Charlton Heston's unrepentant
position. ``This isn't a gun issue,'' he tells us. ``It's a child
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heston has had practice in the handing down of commandments,
thus: Thou shalt defend the right to bear arms in the teeth of all
the evidence, and Thou shalt certainly not be blamed just because a
few kids got iced.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo and Colorado do have something in common. They show that
in our unstable world, incompatible versions of reality are
clashing with one another, with murderous results.
</P>
<P>
   Which does not mean that we can't make moral judgments about the
rival versions of the world that are at war. And the only possible
judgment of the Handke and Heston versions is that they are
reprehensible, indefensible and deserve to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Handke is co-writer of that great movie ``Wings
of Desire.'' Condemned as a ``monster'' by Alain Finkielkraut and
Hans Magnus Enzensberger, by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek
and the Serbian novelist Bora Cosic, he deserves to be, as Susan
Sontag pithily puts it, ``finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Heston, his face as subtly mobile as Mount
Rushmore, has helped millions of moviegoers to snatch a few hours
of peaceful sleep in darkened cinemas. He deserves to be
``finished,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins the prize? Peter Handke's folly makes him complicit
with evil on a grand scale but, fortunately, he is almost entirely
powerless. As America's foremost gun lobbyist, however, Heston is
doing his best to make sure that guns remain an integral part of
the American household; and so, one day soon, somewhere in America,
another young man will take up arms and begin to shoot his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   By reason of his folly's greater effectiveness, I hand Charlton
Heston the palm. But the year's not half done. Greater morons may
yet step forward to challenge him. Watch this space.

moronic. Heston thinks America should arm its teachers and seems to
believe that schools would be safer if staff had the power to gun
down the children in their charge.
</P>
<P>
   I will not draw glib parallels between NATO's aerial
bombardments and the Colorado killings. No, the larger violence did
not breed the lesser. Nor should too much be read into the
accidental echo between Milosevic's Hitlerian tendencies and the
lethal celebration of Hitler's birthday by the so-called
``Trenchcoat Mafia'' or the even more eerie assonance between the
video-game mentality of the Colorado killers and the real-life
aerial videos the NATO publicists show us every day.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of the war, let's agree, too, that it's OK to feel
ambiguous about the confused, changing-policy-on-the-hoof manner of
the NATO action. One minute we're told Milosevic's savage
retaliatory assault on Kosovo couldn't have been foreseen; the next
minute we hear that it should have been. Or again: we're not going
to use ground troops. -- On second thought, maybe we are.
</P>
<P>
   And our war aims? Strictly limited; we seek only to create a
safe haven to which the Kosovar refugees can return. -- No, no,
we're going to march into Belgrade and get Milosevic, we're not
making that old Saddam mistake again!
</P>
<P>
   To object to vacillation and contradiction is not, however, the
same thing as Handke's half-crazy, half-cynical fellow-travelling
with evil. The moral justification for NATO's intervention is the
humanitarian disaster we see on our televisions every night, and to
blame NATO for the plight of the refugees is to absolve the Serb
army of its crimes. It needs to be said again and again: The people
to blame for death and terror are those who commit terrorism and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   And in the matter of the Colorado killings, let us agree that
guns aren't the sole cause of the horror. The killers learned how
to make pipe-bombs on the Internet, and got their trenchcoats from
a Leonardo DiCaprio movie, and learned to put a low value on human
life from -- whom? Their parents? Marilyn Manson? The Goths?
</P>
<P>
   Which is not at all to adopt Charlton Heston's unrepentant
position. ``This isn't a gun issue,'' he tells us. ``It's a child
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heston has had practice in the handing down of commandments,
thus: Thou shalt defend the right to bear arms in the teeth of all
the evidence, and Thou shalt certainly not be blamed just because a
few kids got iced.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo and Colorado do have something in common. They show that
in our unstable world, incompatible versions of reality are
clashing with one another, with murderous results.
</P>
<P>
   Which does not mean that we can't make moral judgments about the
rival versions of the world that are at war. And the only possible
judgment of the Handke and Heston versions is that they are
reprehensible, indefensible and deserve to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Handke is co-writer of that great movie ``Wings
of Desire.'' Condemned as a ``monster'' by Alain Finkielkraut and
Hans Magnus Enzensberger, by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek
and the Serbian novelist Bora Cosic, he deserves to be, as Susan
Sontag pithily puts it, ``finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Heston, his face as subtly mobile as Mount
Rushmore, has helped millions of moviegoers to snatch a few hours
of peaceful sleep in darkened cinemas. He deserves to be
``finished,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins the prize? Peter Handke's folly makes him complicit
with evil on a grand scale but, fortunately, he is almost entirely
powerless. As America's foremost gun lobbyist, however, Heston is
doing his best to make sure that guns remain an integral part of
the American household; and so, one day soon, somewhere in America,
another young man will take up arms and begin to shoot his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   By reason of his folly's greater effectiveness, I hand Charlton
Heston the palm. But the year's not half done. Greater morons may
yet step forward to challenge him. Watch this space.

<P>
   In the battle for the hotly contested title of International
Moron of the Year, two heavyweight contenders stand out.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Austrian writer Peter Handke, who has astonished even
his work's most fervent admirers by a series of impassioned
apologies for the genocidal regime of Slobodan Milosevic, and who,
during a recent visit to Belgrade, received the Order of the
Serbian Knight for his propaganda services.
</P>
<P>
   Handke's previous idiocies include the suggestion that
Sarajevo's Muslims regularly massacred themselves and then blamed
the Serbs and his denial of the genocide carried out by Serbs at
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Now he likens the NATO aerial bombardment to the alien invasion
in the movie ``Mars Attacks!'' And then, foolishly mixing his
metaphors, he compares the Serbs' sufferings to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   His current rival in world-class folly is the movie star
Charlton Heston. As president of the U.S. National Rifle
Association, Heston's response to the massacre of innocents
recently perpetrated by young Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., is a masterpiece of the
moronic. Heston thinks America should arm its teachers and seems to
believe that schools would be safer if staff had the power to gun
down the children in their charge.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Who are the most-desired and inspiring men in the fields of
sports, entertainment, politics and the arts? See if you agree with
the coveted picks below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION: DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, about a decade ago, Dylan McDermott had all
the trappings of soon-to-be movie stardom a young 80s hunk could
hope for: coveted roles in big-budget movies, an open door to the
Brat Pack's Hollywood parties and an engagement to ingenue-du-jour
Julia Roberts, just after they starred in ``Steel Magnolias''
together and her career took off.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: His didn't. Julia moved on to Kiefer
Sutherland _ and superstardom _ and McDermott moved on to less
flashy women _ and humdrum roles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what a difference a decade can make. Today, on a
television studio lot in Manhattan Beach, the 36-year-old actor has
all the trappings a 90s just-made-it TV star could hope for: a trip
to the Super Bowl on the Fox private jet and a brand new black
Jaguar delivered, VIP-style, to the set to ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dressing room sits a silver-framed shot of him winning
his first Golden Globe this year for Best Actor in a TV Drama, sent
by way of congratulations by Paramount's Sherry Lansing. And at
home in Santa Monica, his beautiful actress wife, Shiva Rose Afshar
and two-year-old daughter, Colette, are making Daddy a great
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott discusses the ups and downs of his career as casually
as if it were someone else's. ``You know why I didn't become a
movie star the first go-round?'' he asks. ``Because I wasn't ready
to be a movie star _ I wasn't really a man yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of idealistic, struggling Boston lawyer Bobby Donnell
on ``The Practice'' seems tailor-made for McDermott, finally
showing off his earnestness and intensity _ and leading-man square
jaw and blue eyes. ``Bobby was originally meant to be schlubbier,
less stylish, not too attractive.'' he says. ``But I told them that
even as a Boston criminal attorney, he could buy nice clothes at an
outlet store, and they let me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott may have been a self-described nerd in high school but

   Who are the most-desired and inspiring men in the fields of
sports, entertainment, politics and the arts? See if you agree with
the coveted picks below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION: DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, about a decade ago, Dylan McDermott had all
the trappings of soon-to-be movie stardom a young 80s hunk could
hope for: coveted roles in big-budget movies, an open door to the
Brat Pack's Hollywood parties and an engagement to ingenue-du-jour
Julia Roberts, just after they starred in ``Steel Magnolias''
together and her career took off.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: His didn't. Julia moved on to Kiefer
Sutherland _ and superstardom _ and McDermott moved on to less
flashy women _ and humdrum roles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what a difference a decade can make. Today, on a
television studio lot in Manhattan Beach, the 36-year-old actor has
all the trappings a 90s just-made-it TV star could hope for: a trip
to the Super Bowl on the Fox private jet and a brand new black
Jaguar delivered, VIP-style, to the set to ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dressing room sits a silver-framed shot of him winning
his first Golden Globe this year for Best Actor in a TV Drama, sent
by way of congratulations by Paramount's Sherry Lansing. And at
home in Santa Monica, his beautiful actress wife, Shiva Rose Afshar
and two-year-old daughter, Colette, are making Daddy a great
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott discusses the ups and downs of his career as casually
as if it were someone else's. ``You know why I didn't become a
movie star the first go-round?'' he asks. ``Because I wasn't ready
to be a movie star _ I wasn't really a man yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of idealistic, struggling Boston lawyer Bobby Donnell
on ``The Practice'' seems tailor-made for McDermott, finally
showing off his earnestness and intensity _ and leading-man square
jaw and blue eyes. ``Bobby was originally meant to be schlubbier,
less stylish, not too attractive.'' he says. ``But I told them that
even as a Boston criminal attorney, he could buy nice clothes at an
outlet store, and they let me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott may have been a self-described nerd in high school but
he now gets regular mention as one of Hollywood's best-dressed
actors. ``I think it's because I'm from New York,'' he say, ``and
it is the fashion capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERFORMING ARTS: MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mikhail Baryshnikov arrived in the U.S in 1973, he quickly
learned to fuse his classical Russian training with a free-form
pursuit of more experimental, Western modes of dance. Now a
50-year-old U.S. citizen, Baryshnikov still embodies the best of
both worlds: He's a ferociously disciplined dancer and leader of
the White Oak dance troupe, but he's not opposed to tossing back
some vodka and sounding off about the problems of the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEDIA: MATT LAUER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only recently one of New York's most eligible bachelors,
``Today'' show cohost Matt Lauer, who married Dutch model Annette
Roque in October, is still the man that American women most want to
see across the breakfast table. Generally considered a welcome
relief from the irascible and egocentric Bryant Gumbel (a close
friend and the best man at his wedding), Lauer plies his trade with
a combination of good looks, even temperament and just the right
degree of friendly seriousness required for 8 a.m. His fashion
claim to fame _ dark dress shirts with matching ties _ brought a
runway trend to the streets so quickly that even he had to abandon

power in the country's biggest media conglomerate, but he hasn't

</P>
<P>
   In politics and the environment, he has put his considerable

its international dues. And while the Senate might ponder whether

   Who are the most-desired and inspiring men in the fields of
sports, entertainment, politics and the arts? See if you agree with
the coveted picks below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION: DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, about a decade ago, Dylan McDermott had all
the trappings of soon-to-be movie stardom a young 80s hunk could
hope for: coveted roles in big-budget movies, an open door to the
Brat Pack's Hollywood parties and an engagement to ingenue-du-jour
Julia Roberts, just after they starred in ``Steel Magnolias''
together and her career took off.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: His didn't. Julia moved on to Kiefer
Sutherland _ and superstardom _ and McDermott moved on to less
flashy women _ and humdrum roles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what a difference a decade can make. Today, on a
television studio lot in Manhattan Beach, the 36-year-old actor has
all the trappings a 90s just-made-it TV star could hope for: a trip
to the Super Bowl on the Fox private jet and a brand new black
Jaguar delivered, VIP-style, to the set to ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dressing room sits a silver-framed shot of him winning
his first Golden Globe this year for Best Actor in a TV Drama, sent
by way of congratulations by Paramount's Sherry Lansing. And at
home in Santa Monica, his beautiful actress wife, Shiva Rose Afshar
and two-year-old daughter, Colette, are making Daddy a great
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott discusses the ups and downs of his career as casually
as if it were someone else's. ``You know why I didn't become a
movie star the first go-round?'' he asks. ``Because I wasn't ready
to be a movie star _ I wasn't really a man yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of idealistic, struggling Boston lawyer Bobby Donnell
on ``The Practice'' seems tailor-made for McDermott, finally
showing off his earnestness and intensity _ and leading-man square
jaw and blue eyes. ``Bobby was originally meant to be schlubbier,
less stylish, not too attractive.'' he says. ``But I told them that
even as a Boston criminal attorney, he could buy nice clothes at an
outlet store, and they let me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott may have been a self-described nerd in high school but
he now gets regular mention as one of Hollywood's best-dressed
actors. ``I think it's because I'm from New York,'' he say, ``and
it is the fashion capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERFORMING ARTS: MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mikhail Baryshnikov arrived in the U.S in 1973, he quickly
learned to fuse his classical Russian training with a free-form
pursuit of more experimental, Western modes of dance. Now a
50-year-old U.S. citizen, Baryshnikov still embodies the best of
both worlds: He's a ferociously disciplined dancer and leader of
the White Oak dance troupe, but he's not opposed to tossing back
some vodka and sounding off about the problems of the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEDIA: MATT LAUER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only recently one of New York's most eligible bachelors,
``Today'' show cohost Matt Lauer, who married Dutch model Annette
Roque in October, is still the man that American women most want to
see across the breakfast table. Generally considered a welcome
relief from the irascible and egocentric Bryant Gumbel (a close
friend and the best man at his wedding), Lauer plies his trade with
a combination of good looks, even temperament and just the right
degree of friendly seriousness required for 8 a.m. His fashion
claim to fame _ dark dress shirts with matching ties _ brought a
runway trend to the streets so quickly that even he had to abandon
it lest he look too, well, Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART: DAVID HOCKNEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If David Hockney is one of the world's most popular living
painters, it's not just because his work _ with its emphasis on
luminous colors and inviting spaces _ is so pleasing to the eye.
Hockney is also a genuine charmer who has never felt the need to
play the tortured artiste. Still youthful and sprightly at age 60,
the British expat remains enamored with his adopted country _ an
enthusiasm that shows in his work, whether he's painting his two
basset hounds or the Grand Canyon itself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS: TED TURNER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's loud, abrasive and obnoxious, but in many ways, Ted Turner
is the consummate American businessman. The merger of Turner
Broadcasting with Time Warner in 1996 put him near the center of
power in the country's biggest media conglomerate, but he hasn't
stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   In politics and the environment, he has put his considerable
money where his even more considerable mouth is; even the U.S.
government often pales by comparison. While Turner has pledged a
billion dollars to the United Nations, Congress dithers over paying
its international dues. And while the Senate might ponder whether
to buy a 95,000-acre ranch in the middle of the Santa Fe National
Forest, Turner had already snapped up nearly a million acres in New
Mexico for preservation. ``He is the most important American on the
conservation front since Teddy Roosevelt,'' says NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw, who calls Turner ``a mogul of the highest order.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROYALTY: JOHN F KENNEDY JR. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was unwise of us to put him on the ballot alongside
Prince Charles and Albert of Monaco, but ``George'' magazine editor
in chief John F. Kennedy Jr., received more votes than any other
nominee in any category. Of course, there is his pedigree, which is
impeccable. And you certainly have to agree that he married well.
</P>
<P>
   He also continues to manage a good deal of finesse under the
enormous public scrutiny that comes from being JFK's son: the nasty
tabloid headlines when he flunked his bar exam, his lovers' spats
documented with high-powered lenses, the near hysteria surrounding
his mother's death. But just because he looks better in an evening
suit, is that any reason to pick him over the Dalai Lama?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC: LENNY KRAVITZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although music critics aren't always thrilled with Lenny
Kravitz's derivative brand of 70s-style funk/rock, few would deny
that he looks good in bell-bottoms. Last year, Kravitz released his
fifth album, began his world tour and cut off his famous
dreadlocks. The rocker is also planning a film appearance. Not to
worry, though. He may go Hollywood and he may be shorn, but the
tattoos, the piercings and leather get-ups remain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM: HARRISON FORD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The David Carusos and Ryan Philippes of the world may come and
go, but Harrison Ford _ now in the fourth decade of his career _ is
definitely built to last. The former carpenter's rugged,
regular-guy appeal has helped him become this century's most
dependable action hero: His movies have pulled in an astonishing $2
billion worldwide. As for his unstudied sense of style _ part
Marlboro Man, part soccer dad-well, ``it's match-the-hatch,'' Ford
says. ``That's a fly fishing term. You try to present the fish with
something that looks most like its natural food. I try to dress for
the circumstance. Think of it as protective coloration.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS: TIGER WOODS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Number one-ranked Tiger Woods, who turned the golf world on its
ear in 1997 when he won the Masters at the age of 21 by a
record-setting 12 strokes, has had a tough act to follow: his own.
Yet he has managed to hold his trademark smile and graciousness
through a string of frustrating near-misses in the past year.
Unlike many pro athletes, Woods has taken on the mantle of role
model willingly and responsibly. This year, his Tiger Woods
Foundation will conduct four golf clinics around the country for
inner-city youths during which Woods himself will help out with the
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS: TONY BLAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair stands in stark contrast to past British prime
ministers, not to mention most of the gray men of British politics.
First, there are his boyish looks at 46 (which he turns next
month). Then, there's his meet-the-people style, an M.O. that's far
more Clintonian than Churchillian. Blair may wear the same classic
British suits as his predecessor John Major, but the cut is more
Savile Row than Marks &AMP; Spencer. While on vacation, the
American-admiring Blair favors jeans the staple of his youth as
lead guitarist in the rock band Ugly Rumours.  &QL;   &QL;

Hockney is also a genuine charmer who has never felt the need to
play the tortured artiste. Still youthful and sprightly at age 60,
the British expat remains enamored with his adopted country _ an
enthusiasm that shows in his work, whether he's painting his two
basset hounds or the Grand Canyon itself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS: TED TURNER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's loud, abrasive and obnoxious, but in many ways, Ted Turner
is the consummate American businessman. The merger of Turner
Broadcasting with Time Warner in 1996 put him near the center of
power in the country's biggest media conglomerate, but he hasn't
stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   In politics and the environment, he has put his considerable
money where his even more considerable mouth is; even the U.S.
government often pales by comparison. While Turner has pledged a
billion dollars to the United Nations, Congress dithers over paying
its international dues. And while the Senate might ponder whether
to buy a 95,000-acre ranch in the middle of the Santa Fe National
Forest, Turner had already snapped up nearly a million acres in New
Mexico for preservation. ``He is the most important American on the
conservation front since Teddy Roosevelt,'' says NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw, who calls Turner ``a mogul of the highest order.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROYALTY: JOHN F KENNEDY JR. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was unwise of us to put him on the ballot alongside
Prince Charles and Albert of Monaco, but ``George'' magazine editor
in chief John F. Kennedy Jr., received more votes than any other
nominee in any category. Of course, there is his pedigree, which is
impeccable. And you certainly have to agree that he married well.
</P>
<P>
   He also continues to manage a good deal of finesse under the
enormous public scrutiny that comes from being JFK's son: the nasty
tabloid headlines when he flunked his bar exam, his lovers' spats
documented with high-powered lenses, the near hysteria surrounding
his mother's death. But just because he looks better in an evening
suit, is that any reason to pick him over the Dalai Lama?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC: LENNY KRAVITZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although music critics aren't always thrilled with Lenny
Kravitz's derivative brand of 70s-style funk/rock, few would deny
that he looks good in bell-bottoms. Last year, Kravitz released his
fifth album, began his world tour and cut off his famous
dreadlocks. The rocker is also planning a film appearance. Not to
worry, though. He may go Hollywood and he may be shorn, but the
tattoos, the piercings and leather get-ups remain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM: HARRISON FORD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The David Carusos and Ryan Philippes of the world may come and
go, but Harrison Ford _ now in the fourth decade of his career _ is
definitely built to last. The former carpenter's rugged,
regular-guy appeal has helped him become this century's most
dependable action hero: His movies have pulled in an astonishing $2
billion worldwide. As for his unstudied sense of style _ part
Marlboro Man, part soccer dad-well, ``it's match-the-hatch,'' Ford
says. ``That's a fly fishing term. You try to present the fish with
something that looks most like its natural food. I try to dress for
the circumstance. Think of it as protective coloration.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS: TIGER WOODS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Number one-ranked Tiger Woods, who turned the golf world on its
ear in 1997 when he won the Masters at the age of 21 by a
record-setting 12 strokes, has had a tough act to follow: his own.
Yet he has managed to hold his trademark smile and graciousness
through a string of frustrating near-misses in the past year.
Unlike many pro athletes, Woods has taken on the mantle of role
model willingly and responsibly. This year, his Tiger Woods
Foundation will conduct four golf clinics around the country for
inner-city youths during which Woods himself will help out with the
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS: TONY BLAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair stands in stark contrast to past British prime
ministers, not to mention most of the gray men of British politics.
First, there are his boyish looks at 46 (which he turns next
month). Then, there's his meet-the-people style, an M.O. that's far
more Clintonian than Churchillian. Blair may wear the same classic
British suits as his predecessor John Major, but the cut is more
Savile Row than Marks &AMP; Spencer. While on vacation, the
American-admiring Blair favors jeans the staple of his youth as
lead guitarist in the rock band Ugly Rumours.  &QL;   &QL;

THIS `MUMMY' ISN'T ALL THAT SCARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First, it's not scary. So, whatever else ``The
Mummy'' strives so strenuously to be is pretty much beside the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The film is designed as a speed-demon desert adventure, an
Indiana Jones romp without brakes (but numerous bad-joke speed
bumps). The action, the special effects, the firepower, even the
Mummy himself are so turbo-charged, they leave no space for mood or
chill to set in.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's original, 1932 ``Mummy'' had its creaky qualities,
but it was so rich in shadowy atmosphere that it still stands as
one of the creepiest black-and-white movies ever made. More than
the other Universal horrors _ ``Dracula,'' ``Frankenstein,'' ``The
Wolf Man'' _ that have suffered hyperactive remakes in recent
years, ``The Mummy'' comes with the most delicious expectation of
dread. Anyone who's seen Boris Karloff skulk about in those
exquisitely rotting bandages knows what fear is all about.
</P>
<P>
   The Mummy in this new incarnation does a lot more than skulk. He
can turn into sand, into wind, call down the biblical curses of
Exodus on Egypt and mentally command armies of fellow mummies and
zombiefied humans. He comes in various stages of computer-generated
decomposition, then, as his strength grows, evolves into the
handsome and imposing form of South African actor Arnold Vosloo. He
is, to sum up, Supermummy.
</P>
<P>
   But, while he makes a formidable villain, he's not at all
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1920s Egypt, the film stars Brendan Fraser as American
soldier of fortune Rick O'Connell, Rachel Weisz as a klutzy English
Egyptologist named Evelyn and John Hannah as her arch, wastrel
brother Jonathan. For all the usual adventure movie reasons, they
set out to plunder Hamunaptra, the ancient lost city of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a rival group of American cowboys and their highly
expendable Arab bearers, our heroes are busy plundering the place
when the sarcophagus of high priest Imhotep is disturbed. Wrapped
up alive more than 3,000 years ago for messing with the Pharoah's
mistress, Imhotep still has, as O'Donnell indelicately but
accurately puts it, a ``juicy'' skeleton. That's because, of
course, there's some life left in the old boy _ and ``juicy's''
about the only gag line in director Stephen Sommers' script that
has any life as well.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie involves Imhotep stalking his disturbers
to Cairo and back, fixated on Evelyn as the perfect vessel for
bringing his long-dead lover back to life. Lots of guns are fired
ineffectually at the creature, but since the only things that
really threaten the Mummy are cats (that's right, pussycats), this
all plays like a particularly gratuitous volley of bullets
substituted for brains.
</P>
<P>
   Even more gratuitous, though, is the mostly out-of-register cast
members' attempts to play against all of this violent monstrousness
like they were in a Hope-Crosby movie or something (``The Road to
Luxor''?). Director Sommers comes from a background of Disney kid
movies (``Huck Finn,'' ``The Jungle Book''), and he encourages
animated performances, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, his ``George of the Jungle'' background coming in handy,
fares best, locating a workable balance between unruffled heroism
and smirky burlesque. But Hannah, who was low-key cuddly in
``Sliding Doors'' last year, brings nothing but bad timing to his
twit's antics here. Weisz's wide-eyed, wider-mouthed approach makes
you wish some embalmer would come along and wrap her head in linen.
And Kevin J. O'Connor simply has too much screen time as Imhotep's
weaselly henchman.
</P>
<P>
   Sets and special effects are big and often beautiful. An opening
pan across a CG Thebes, circa 1719 B.C., is jaw-dropping (later,
digitized Cairo cityscapes just look cheesy). There's an impressive
pitched battle with Foreign Legion troops, lots of scarabs and
other icky bugs, vast buried chambers with alarming moving parts
and just about everything else you'd expect to see Harrison Ford
play with.
</P>
<P>
   But very little of it belongs in a horror movie. ``The Mummy''
may be about a war between monsters and heroes, but it's really a
movie at war with itself, generic action-comedy vs. classic horror.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one comes out alive. &UR;

CLUELESS CLAN MAKES FOR COMIC BLISS

OUR RATING:  3  1/2 stars  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The Kerrigans are not the brightest bulbs in
Cooloroo, Australia. But happily for them _ and us _ they don't
know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Castle'' is the most impossible kind of comedy to pull
off, one in which you can't stop laughing at the protagonists while
laughing with them. Maintaining a tone of what can only be called
affectionate facetiousness from beginning to end, it's a movie that
likes to have at its flakes and fete them, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Kerrigans are a close-knit, self-satisfied clan who couldn't
be cozier in their ramshackle house on the edge of an airport.
They're not merely oblivious to plane noise, they appreciate it,
much as Darryl (Michael Caton), the tow truck-driving patriarch,
finds standing under the high-tension wires that also flank his
property a good place to think.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl loves the two slacker sons he has at home and the one he
has in jail, the big-haired wife (Anne Tenney) who he thinks is a
gourmet cook with ketchup and the just-married, bigger-haired
daughter (Sophie Lee), who's done him prouder than a man could be
by graduating from beautician school. They lead a full, to them
deliriously magical life scanning newspapers for secondhand
bargains and watching ``Best of Funniest Home Videos'' as a group.
</P>
<P>
   But then the unthinkable happens. Their aluminum-sided Eden is
threatened with ``compulsory acquisition,'' being bought and torn
down by a government-backed corporation that wants to expand the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Darryl Kerrigan gives up his family's castle for no one,
even if he and the idiot lawyer (Tiriel Mora, hilariously
disorganized) who lost his son's case have to fight all the way to
Australia's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Castle'' was written by a TV comedy outfit that calls
itself Working Dog and directed by one of its members, Rob Sitch.
They have a great way of championing hokey homilies _ home, family,
little guy, honor _ while suggesting that it takes a certain dogged
innocence to actually live those values to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dogs also have a great sense of comic repetition. Characters
constantly say whatever someone else just said, thereby revealing
both their mental density and, through different inflections,
emotional dimensions that they otherwise couldn't articulate. It
sounds like a cheap way to get laughs, but there's genius in how
they keep the ploy fresh through the whole movie.
</P>
<P>
   Caton is outstanding as a man who can't imagine anything beyond
the dingo perfection of his goofy world. He is, in his way, the
classic Australian individualist, just not one equipped with
Crocodile Dundee's mental capacities. There's a desperation to his
quest that's truly poignant; you can't imagine him surviving, much
less thriving as he does, anywhere but home.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the film is designed to get you totally on the
Kerrigans' side. They're good, righteous people, after all, and
they're fighting a real injustice. But ``The Castle's'' sly
brilliance lies in the way it convinces you they belong together in
the home of their choice _ and not, thankfully, in yours. &UR;  &QL;

 &HT;    _________________________-
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Their very names are evocative: ``The Empire Builder,'' ``The
Sunset Limited'' and ``The Coast Starlight.'' They are among the
last of the great trains that cross the United States, recalling a
time when rail travel was the only way to go. Even today, a
well-planned rail journey can recapture much of the old romance of
the rails. There are multi-day, cross-country routes in the United
States on Amtrak and in Canada on Via Rail, as well as two-day
daylight trips through the _ on the Rocky Mountaineer to choose
from.
 &HT;    Train travel is all about slowing down and making the journey a
part of the vacation. Fortunately, the comfort level has risen of
late. The much-beleaguered Amtrak has updated its cars and improved
levels of service and food in the past five years. While coach
travel remains an economical option, travel by sleeper car can
really transform a train journey.
 &HT;    Sleepers require first class fares on Amtrak and include all
meals. Standard bedrooms have two reclining seats that convert to a
bed. Deluxe bedrooms, which are about 30 percent more expensive and
come with a private bathroom, are designed for two passengers and
feature a sofa and armchair that convert to an upper and lower
berth.
 &HT;    Amtrak pricing is rather complicated and not unlike airline
pricing. There's a set charge for a sleeper compartment, and then
fare charges for each passenger which are based on a variety of
factors, including the season and the day of the week. Contact
Amtrak (60 Massachusetts Ave. N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002;
800-USA-RAIL/www.amtrak.com) for current pricing. Note that making
multiple stops is a popular option, as is the North America Rail
Pass, which provides 30 days of unlimited travel in both the U.S.
and Canada for a 90-day period.
 &HT;    What are the most exciting overnight routes in the United
States? Start with ``The Sunset Limited,'' which runs from Orlando
to Los Angeles by way of New Orleans and Houston, some 3,000 miles
across the county, an eight-state journey from Florida to
California. Then there's ``The Empire Builder,'' which leaves from
Chicago and goes to either Portland or Seattle. This train through
Big Sky country brings travelers face to face with the Bear Paw
Mountains, Glacier National Park, the Rockies and the Cascades.
 &HT;    The ``California Zephyr'' runs from Chicago through three
mountain ranges, two deserts and alongside the Colorado River for a
couple of hundred miles before arriving in greater San Francisco.
Many diehard train buffs as well as first-timers claim that this is
the most beautiful train ride in the United States. From the
breadbasket of America to the Rockies, from the Wasatch Mountains
and into Salt Lake City, the train continues to Reno, the mile-high
Donner Pass and then down to Sacramento and into Oakland.
 &HT;    ``The Coast Starlight'' runs from Los Angeles to Seattle. It's
Amtrak's most popular train and it literally hugs the Pacific
coast, from southern California all the way up to Santa Barbara,
and then to San Francisco, into Oregon and finally Washington. Only
``The Coast Starlight'' has the Pacific Parlour Car, a customized
lounge car for first class travelers.
 &HT;    ``The Cardinal'' links Washington D.C. with Chicago via the
riverfront city of Cincinnati, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia and along the New River Gorge in West Virginia, with a
U.S. Forest Ranger providing commentary at apt moments.
 &HT;    On VIA Rail Canada's (P.O. Box 8116, Station A, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada H3C 3N3; 800-561-9181 www.viarail.ca) trains in the
East, Easterly Class offers private bedrooms with a bathroom and a
shared shower while semi-private seating converts to a curtained
berth by night. On VIA Rail trains in Western Canada, Silver &AMP; Blue
Class bedrooms sleep two with a private bathroom. Less expensive is
semi-private seating that converts to curtained berths at night,
with shared bathrooms.
 &HT;    In Canada, ``The Ocean'' is the train that runs between
Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The scenic way to pass
from French-speaking Quebec into the Maritimes, this train speeds
along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, past Riviere-du-Loup
through the Matapedia Valley to Baie des Chaleurs. From there, it
continues on to New Brunswick, through Moncton, into Amherst, Nova
Scotia and finally to Halifax.
 &HT;    ``The Canadian'' runs from Toronto, Ontario to Vancouver,
British Columbia. The most famous train ride in North America
crosses two-thirds of Canada, from the endless forest of Ontario to
the surreal plains of Manitoba and the wheat fields of Saskatchewan
before reaching the heart of the Rockies in Jasper, where elk
wander through the streets. Continuing through the Rockies, the
train cuts through the high desert of British Columbia before
reaching the coastal rain forest and Vancouver, a journey of 2,770
miles.
 &HT;    Finally, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station Street,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) makes two-day daylight trips through the
Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer, traveling from Vancouver
to either Jasper, Banff or Calgary, Alberta, with overnight hotel
stay in Kamloops, British Columbia. For Signature Service, prices
start at $362 per person and include the overnight stay and some
meals.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If anyone tells you that mature travelers can't make a walking
tour of Tuscany, they're wrong. Bernie Lee (72-years-old) and his
wife, Helen, (62-years-old) are living proof: Last October they
hiked up to Cortona, Montepulciano, Pienza, Montalcino, Siena and
San Gimignano _ some of the most beautiful hill towns in Tuscany.
 &HT;    The Lees suggest that mature travelers get in shape before
undertaking a Tuscany walking trip. It's ill-advised to think you
can get up off the couch, go to Italy and start walking. Some
Tuscan hills rise 2,000 feet and more, and the most beautiful towns
are situated on top.
 &HT;    Both Lees are retired _ he from advertising, she from banking _
and live in Oregon in a house at 900-feet elevation. But since they
rarely walk to their home, they sought their doctors' OK to go
climbing in Tuscany which was also required by their tour company's
health questionnaire. The only extra shot their doctors recommended
was Hepatitis B.
 &HT;    Both exercise regularly. Helen does water aerobics three
mornings a week, and Bernie walks two miles and lifts weights. But
what saved the Lees in Tuscany was their homemade training program
of weekly 5-mile walk begun a month prior to departure.
 &HT;    According to the travel brochure from their tour company,
Ciclismo Classico, which books biking and walking tours from
offices at 13 Marathon St., Arlington, Mass. 02474 (call 800
866-7314), they would be walking four to six miles per day. But as
it turned out, some days they walked ten miles.
 &HT;    Lee especially remembers the sunny afternoon when they were on
their way from Montichiello to Pienza. After walking for about two
hours _ through farmers' fields and along a blacktop back-road _ he
looked across a broad valley where silver-green olive trees
shimmered in the heat. Beyond was their destination: A distant
pine-topped hill where the ancient wall of Pienza glowed in the
golden afternoon light.
 &HT;    He remembers sweating up the hill as the pines, but not Pienza,
got closer.
 &HT;    ``Forty minutes later,'' he recalls, ``I reached the trees and
saw that lying road make a right-angle turn, loop down the hill,
meander across another wide valley and then climb a longer, steeper
hill to Pienza's gate!''
 &HT;    Two hours later, he walked through the gate, tired and sweaty,
but grateful for their pre-trip exercise routine that had paid off
with extra stamina.
 DINING  
 &HT;    The Lees' hotel breakfast fare consisted of juice, coffee, tea,
great bread and croissants, cheese and/or thin slivers of
prosciutto. During eight days in Tuscany, they never saw an egg.
 &HT;    But the dinners! In Pienza at a restaurant located inside the
gate, the Lees say they ate one of life's memorable meals. They sat
down at 8 p.m. and the food kept coming for the next two hours:
appetizers, soup, pasta, vegetables, salad, two meat dishes
(including wild boar) and dessert.
 ARTICULATE AND ATTRACTIVE GUIDES  
 &HT;    Natives of Tuscany, the Lee's guides were proud of their land
and happy to share their knowledge of its history, art and culture.
Guido Giuntini, 34, is tall, athletic and a graduate in political
science, while 29-year old Angelica Turi is petite, fair, and works
in art restoration in Florence.
 &HT;    Near Cortona, Turi stood in a tiny cell in gray Etruscan tomb
and talked about the people who had built the structure in 900 B.C.
and the type of stone they used.
 &HT;    South of Siena, Giuntini led the group across a drawbridge and
into a beautiful Benedictine monastery founded in 1313, the remote
abbey of Mount Oliveto Maggiore. Inside the great cloister, whose
four walls seem alive with huge paintings depicting the life of St.
Benedict, Giuntini showed the group how to read the 36 frescoes by
artists Sodoma and Signorelli.
 &HT;    Occasionally the guides brought in other Tuscan experts _ an
archaeologist in Cortona, a historian in Siena and a wine maker in
Montalcino. Their tour also included side trips to a centuries-old
crystal workshop and to an olive oil factory.
 HITCHING A LIFT  
 &HT;    On some side trips the Lees' tour group rode in a van, which was
also available to walkers on long hikes who needed to hitch a ride.
The van was always ready in the event of an emergency and the
guides carried first-aid kits and cellular phones to contact the
van or the nearest hospital/helicopter service if needed.
 &HT;    Giuntini says most of the people on walking tours are over 50.
The Lees' group had a few 40-year-olds, but most travelers were in
their 50s, 60s or 70s.
 NO PROBLEM  
 &HT;    The Lees had no trouble with water in Italy. Or, with
communication. Italians are pros at reading gestures and
expressions, although they appreciate your efforts to speak their
language.
 &HT;    They recommend walkers take a small backpack or waistpack for
camera, binoculars, light rain jacket and water bottle.
Specifically, they suggest a pack with a handy bottle pocket.
 &HT;    Also recommended are comfortable, well-fitting walking shoes _
particularly high-tops _ to support ankles on rough trails and
cobblestone streets. To prevent blisters, the Lees suggest a thin
pair of socks over thicker walking socks.
 &HT;    Accommodations on the Tuscany walking tours were, according to
the Lees, on par with the not-bad hotels in Fresno or Keokuk.
However, the hotels are located atop hills and boast spectacular
views.
 &HT;    The Lees paid $2,250 for this eight-day tour, including hotels,
breakfasts, two picnics and six dinners.
 &HT;    ``A little spendy,'' according to Helen. Bernie agrees, ``Maybe
so. But we had a wonderful time in Tuscany.''
 &HT;    
 WALKS FOR SENIORS  
 &HT;    Hundreds of companies around the world package walking trips,
but some are ideal for mature travelers. Brochures rate them by
difficulty, van support and all meals. Walks can range up to ten
miles a day, but those designed for seniors are usually a bit
shorter.
 &HT;    Shott's Walks in the West offers an all-year series of
lodge-based walking trips limited to travelers 50 years and older
in Alaska, Colorado and other parts of the West and Northwest.
(719) 531-9577.
 &HT;    Walking the World packages hiking trips just for seniors that
include places ranging from Hawaii's volcanoes to New Zealand's
Milford Track. (800) 340-9255.
 &HT;    Walk Your Way. Rosemary O'Chris, who grew up in England, leads
low-key hikes through places like the Cotswolds, Dorset Villages
and the Lake District. Many are circular walks with light
day-packs, based in a single village. (970) 881-2709.
 &HT;    ElderTreks' demanding series of worldwide trips, limited to
active seniors, often includes back-packing and camping out in
places like the Australian Outback, Galapagos and Borneo. (416)
588-5000.
 &HT;    Mount Robson Adventure Holidays ``Fifty Plus Adventures''
include shorter scenic walks in the shadow of Canada's highest
peak, plus bird-watching, canoeing and rafting. (250) 566-4386.
 &HT;    Nifty Over Fifty tours are led by Jan Coyle in her native New
Zealand. Write Pacific Pathways, 1919 Chula Vista, Belmont, CA

 &HT;    Their very names are evocative: ``The Empire Builder,'' ``The
Sunset Limited'' and ``The Coast Starlight.'' They are among the
last of the great trains that cross the United States, recalling a
time when rail travel was the only way to go. Even today, a
well-planned rail journey can recapture much of the old romance of
the rails. There are multi-day, cross-country routes in the United
States on Amtrak and in Canada on Via Rail, as well as two-day
daylight trips through the _ on the Rocky Mountaineer to choose
from.
 &HT;    Train travel is all about slowing down and making the journey a
part of the vacation. Fortunately, the comfort level has risen of
late. The much-beleaguered Amtrak has updated its cars and improved
levels of service and food in the past five years. While coach
travel remains an economical option, travel by sleeper car can
really transform a train journey.
 &HT;    Sleepers require first class fares on Amtrak and include all
meals. Standard bedrooms have two reclining seats that convert to a
bed. Deluxe bedrooms, which are about 30 percent more expensive and
come with a private bathroom, are designed for two passengers and
feature a sofa and armchair that convert to an upper and lower
berth.
 &HT;    Amtrak pricing is rather complicated and not unlike airline
pricing. There's a set charge for a sleeper compartment, and then
fare charges for each passenger which are based on a variety of
factors, including the season and the day of the week. Contact
Amtrak (60 Massachusetts Ave. N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002;
800-USA-RAIL/www.amtrak.com) for current pricing. Note that making
multiple stops is a popular option, as is the North America Rail
Pass, which provides 30 days of unlimited travel in both the U.S.
and Canada for a 90-day period.
 &HT;    What are the most exciting overnight routes in the United
States? Start with ``The Sunset Limited,'' which runs from Orlando
to Los Angeles by way of New Orleans and Houston, some 3,000 miles
across the county, an eight-state journey from Florida to
California. Then there's ``The Empire Builder,'' which leaves from
Chicago and goes to either Portland or Seattle. This train through
Big Sky country brings travelers face to face with the Bear Paw
Mountains, Glacier National Park, the Rockies and the Cascades.
 &HT;    The ``California Zephyr'' runs from Chicago through three
mountain ranges, two deserts and alongside the Colorado River for a
couple of hundred miles before arriving in greater San Francisco.
Many diehard train buffs as well as first-timers claim that this is
the most beautiful train ride in the United States. From the
breadbasket of America to the Rockies, from the Wasatch Mountains
and into Salt Lake City, the train continues to Reno, the mile-high
Donner Pass and then down to Sacramento and into Oakland.
 &HT;    ``The Coast Starlight'' runs from Los Angeles to Seattle. It's
Amtrak's most popular train and it literally hugs the Pacific
coast, from southern California all the way up to Santa Barbara,
and then to San Francisco, into Oregon and finally Washington. Only
``The Coast Starlight'' has the Pacific Parlour Car, a customized
lounge car for first class travelers.
 &HT;    ``The Cardinal'' links Washington D.C. with Chicago via the
riverfront city of Cincinnati, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia and along the New River Gorge in West Virginia, with a
U.S. Forest Ranger providing commentary at apt moments.
 &HT;    On VIA Rail Canada's (P.O. Box 8116, Station A, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada H3C 3N3; 800-561-9181 www.viarail.ca) trains in the
East, Easterly Class offers private bedrooms with a bathroom and a
shared shower while semi-private seating converts to a curtained
berth by night. On VIA Rail trains in Western Canada, Silver &AMP; Blue
Class bedrooms sleep two with a private bathroom. Less expensive is
semi-private seating that converts to curtained berths at night,
with shared bathrooms.
 &HT;    In Canada, ``The Ocean'' is the train that runs between
Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The scenic way to pass
from French-speaking Quebec into the Maritimes, this train speeds
along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, past Riviere-du-Loup
through the Matapedia Valley to Baie des Chaleurs. From there, it
continues on to New Brunswick, through Moncton, into Amherst, Nova
Scotia and finally to Halifax.
 &HT;    ``The Canadian'' runs from Toronto, Ontario to Vancouver,
British Columbia. The most famous train ride in North America
crosses two-thirds of Canada, from the endless forest of Ontario to
the surreal plains of Manitoba and the wheat fields of Saskatchewan
before reaching the heart of the Rockies in Jasper, where elk
wander through the streets. Continuing through the Rockies, the
train cuts through the high desert of British Columbia before
reaching the coastal rain forest and Vancouver, a journey of 2,770
miles.
 &HT;    Finally, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station Street,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) makes two-day daylight trips through the
Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer, traveling from Vancouver
to either Jasper, Banff or Calgary, Alberta, with overnight hotel
stay in Kamloops, British Columbia. For Signature Service, prices
start at $362 per person and include the overnight stay and some
meals.

 &HT;    Sleepers require first class fares on Amtrak and include all
meals. Standard bedrooms have two reclining seats that convert to a
bed. Deluxe bedrooms, which are about 30 percent more expensive and
come with a private bathroom, are designed for two passengers and
feature a sofa and armchair that convert to an upper and lower
berth.
 &HT;    Amtrak pricing is rather complicated and not unlike airline
pricing. There's a set charge for a sleeper compartment, and then
fare charges for each passenger which are based on a variety of
factors, including the season and the day of the week. Contact
Amtrak (60 Massachusetts Ave. N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002;
800-USA-RAIL/www.amtrak.com) for current pricing. Note that making
multiple stops is a popular option, as is the North America Rail
Pass, which provides 30 days of unlimited travel in both the U.S.
and Canada for a 90-day period.
 &HT;    What are the most exciting overnight routes in the United
States? Start with ``The Sunset Limited,'' which runs from Orlando
to Los Angeles by way of New Orleans and Houston, some 3,000 miles
across the county, an eight-state journey from Florida to
California. Then there's ``The Empire Builder,'' which leaves from
Chicago and goes to either Portland or Seattle. This train through
Big Sky country brings travelers face to face with the Bear Paw
Mountains, Glacier National Park, the Rockies and the Cascades.
 &HT;    The ``California Zephyr'' runs from Chicago through three
mountain ranges, two deserts and alongside the Colorado River for a
couple of hundred miles before arriving in greater San Francisco.
Many diehard train buffs as well as first-timers claim that this is
the most beautiful train ride in the United States. From the
breadbasket of America to the Rockies, from the Wasatch Mountains
and into Salt Lake City, the train continues to Reno, the mile-high
Donner Pass and then down to Sacramento and into Oakland.
 &HT;    ``The Coast Starlight'' runs from Los Angeles to Seattle. It's
Amtrak's most popular train and it literally hugs the Pacific
coast, from southern California all the way up to Santa Barbara,
and then to San Francisco, into Oregon and finally Washington. Only
``The Coast Starlight'' has the Pacific Parlour Car, a customized
lounge car for first class travelers.
 &HT;    ``The Cardinal'' links Washington D.C. with Chicago via the
riverfront city of Cincinnati, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia and along the New River Gorge in West Virginia, with a
U.S. Forest Ranger providing commentary at apt moments.
 &HT;    On VIA Rail Canada's (P.O. Box 8116, Station A, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada H3C 3N3; 800-561-9181 www.viarail.ca) trains in the
East, Easterly Class offers private bedrooms with a bathroom and a
shared shower while semi-private seating converts to a curtained
berth by night. On VIA Rail trains in Western Canada, Silver &AMP; Blue
Class bedrooms sleep two with a private bathroom. Less expensive is
semi-private seating that converts to curtained berths at night,
with shared bathrooms.
 &HT;    In Canada, ``The Ocean'' is the train that runs between
Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The scenic way to pass
from French-speaking Quebec into the Maritimes, this train speeds
along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, past Riviere-du-Loup
through the Matapedia Valley to Baie des Chaleurs. From there, it
continues on to New Brunswick, through Moncton, into Amherst, Nova
Scotia and finally to Halifax.
 &HT;    ``The Canadian'' runs from Toronto, Ontario to Vancouver,
British Columbia. The most famous train ride in North America
crosses two-thirds of Canada, from the endless forest of Ontario to
the surreal plains of Manitoba and the wheat fields of Saskatchewan
before reaching the heart of the Rockies in Jasper, where elk
wander through the streets. Continuing through the Rockies, the
train cuts through the high desert of British Columbia before
reaching the coastal rain forest and Vancouver, a journey of 2,770
miles.
 &HT;    Finally, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station Street,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) makes two-day daylight trips through the
Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer, traveling from Vancouver
to either Jasper, Banff or Calgary, Alberta, with overnight hotel
stay in Kamloops, British Columbia. For Signature Service, prices
start at $362 per person and include the overnight stay and some
meals.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If anyone tells you that mature travelers can't make a walking
tour of Tuscany, they're wrong. Bernie Lee (72-years-old) and his
wife, Helen, (62-years-old) are living proof: Last October they
hiked up to Cortona, Montepulciano, Pienza, Montalcino, Siena and
San Gimignano _ some of the most beautiful hill towns in Tuscany.
 &HT;    The Lees suggest that mature travelers get in shape before
undertaking a Tuscany walking trip. It's ill-advised to think you
can get up off the couch, go to Italy and start walking. Some
Tuscan hills rise 2,000 feet and more, and the most beautiful towns
are situated on top.
 &HT;    Both Lees are retired _ he from advertising, she from banking _
and live in Oregon in a house at 900-feet elevation. But since they
rarely walk to their home, they sought their doctors' OK to go
climbing in Tuscany which was also required by their tour company's
health questionnaire. The only extra shot their doctors recommended
was Hepatitis B.
 &HT;    Both exercise regularly. Helen does water aerobics three
mornings a week, and Bernie walks two miles and lifts weights. But
what saved the Lees in Tuscany was their homemade training program
of weekly 5-mile walk begun a month prior to departure.
 &HT;    According to the travel brochure from their tour company,
Ciclismo Classico, which books biking and walking tours from
offices at 13 Marathon St., Arlington, Mass. 02474 (call 800
866-7314), they would be walking four to six miles per day. But as
it turned out, some days they walked ten miles.
 &HT;    Lee especially remembers the sunny afternoon when they were on
their way from Montichiello to Pienza. After walking for about two
hours _ through farmers' fields and along a blacktop back-road _ he
looked across a broad valley where silver-green olive trees
shimmered in the heat. Beyond was their destination: A distant
pine-topped hill where the ancient wall of Pienza glowed in the
golden afternoon light.
 &HT;    He remembers sweating up the hill as the pines, but not Pienza,
got closer.
 &HT;    ``Forty minutes later,'' he recalls, ``I reached the trees and
saw that lying road make a right-angle turn, loop down the hill,
meander across another wide valley and then climb a longer, steeper
hill to Pienza's gate!''
 &HT;    Two hours later, he walked through the gate, tired and sweaty,
but grateful for their pre-trip exercise routine that had paid off
with extra stamina.
 DINING  
 &HT;    The Lees' hotel breakfast fare consisted of juice, coffee, tea,
great bread and croissants, cheese and/or thin slivers of
prosciutto. During eight days in Tuscany, they never saw an egg.
 &HT;    But the dinners! In Pienza at a restaurant located inside the
gate, the Lees say they ate one of life's memorable meals. They sat
down at 8 p.m. and the food kept coming for the next two hours:
appetizers, soup, pasta, vegetables, salad, two meat dishes
(including wild boar) and dessert.
 ARTICULATE AND ATTRACTIVE GUIDES  
 &HT;    Natives of Tuscany, the Lee's guides were proud of their land
and happy to share their knowledge of its history, art and culture.
Guido Giuntini, 34, is tall, athletic and a graduate in political
science, while 29-year old Angelica Turi is petite, fair, and works
in art restoration in Florence.
 &HT;    Near Cortona, Turi stood in a tiny cell in gray Etruscan tomb
and talked about the people who had built the structure in 900 B.C.
and the type of stone they used.
 &HT;    South of Siena, Giuntini led the group across a drawbridge and
into a beautiful Benedictine monastery founded in 1313, the remote
abbey of Mount Oliveto Maggiore. Inside the great cloister, whose
four walls seem alive with huge paintings depicting the life of St.
Benedict, Giuntini showed the group how to read the 36 frescoes by
artists Sodoma and Signorelli.
 &HT;    Occasionally the guides brought in other Tuscan experts _ an
archaeologist in Cortona, a historian in Siena and a wine maker in
Montalcino. Their tour also included side trips to a centuries-old
crystal workshop and to an olive oil factory.
 HITCHING A LIFT  
 &HT;    On some side trips the Lees' tour group rode in a van, which was
also available to walkers on long hikes who needed to hitch a ride.
The van was always ready in the event of an emergency and the
guides carried first-aid kits and cellular phones to contact the
van or the nearest hospital/helicopter service if needed.
 &HT;    Giuntini says most of the people on walking tours are over 50.
The Lees' group had a few 40-year-olds, but most travelers were in
their 50s, 60s or 70s.
 NO PROBLEM  
 &HT;    The Lees had no trouble with water in Italy. Or, with
communication. Italians are pros at reading gestures and
expressions, although they appreciate your efforts to speak their
language.
 &HT;    They recommend walkers take a small backpack or waistpack for
camera, binoculars, light rain jacket and water bottle.
Specifically, they suggest a pack with a handy bottle pocket.
 &HT;    Also recommended are comfortable, well-fitting walking shoes _
particularly high-tops _ to support ankles on rough trails and
cobblestone streets. To prevent blisters, the Lees suggest a thin
pair of socks over thicker walking socks.
 &HT;    Accommodations on the Tuscany walking tours were, according to
the Lees, on par with the not-bad hotels in Fresno or Keokuk.
However, the hotels are located atop hills and boast spectacular
views.
 &HT;    The Lees paid $2,250 for this eight-day tour, including hotels,
breakfasts, two picnics and six dinners.
 &HT;    ``A little spendy,'' according to Helen. Bernie agrees, ``Maybe
so. But we had a wonderful time in Tuscany.''
 &HT;    
 WALKS FOR SENIORS  
 &HT;    Hundreds of companies around the world package walking trips,
but some are ideal for mature travelers. Brochures rate them by
difficulty, van support and all meals. Walks can range up to ten
miles a day, but those designed for seniors are usually a bit
shorter.
 &HT;    Shott's Walks in the West offers an all-year series of
lodge-based walking trips limited to travelers 50 years and older
in Alaska, Colorado and other parts of the West and Northwest.
(719) 531-9577.
 &HT;    Walking the World packages hiking trips just for seniors that
include places ranging from Hawaii's volcanoes to New Zealand's
Milford Track. (800) 340-9255.
 &HT;    Walk Your Way. Rosemary O'Chris, who grew up in England, leads
low-key hikes through places like the Cotswolds, Dorset Villages
and the Lake District. Many are circular walks with light
day-packs, based in a single village. (970) 881-2709.
 &HT;    ElderTreks' demanding series of worldwide trips, limited to
active seniors, often includes back-packing and camping out in
places like the Australian Outback, Galapagos and Borneo. (416)
588-5000.
 &HT;    Mount Robson Adventure Holidays ``Fifty Plus Adventures''
include shorter scenic walks in the shadow of Canada's highest
peak, plus bird-watching, canoeing and rafting. (250) 566-4386.
 &HT;    Nifty Over Fifty tours are led by Jan Coyle in her native New
Zealand. Write Pacific Pathways, 1919 Chula Vista, Belmont, CA
94002; call (650) 595-2090.
 &HT;    Look Again Tours of Sacramento offers an annual walking trip to
the British Isles for those 50 years and older. Call (916)

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Their very names are evocative: ``The Empire Builder,'' ``The
Sunset Limited'' and ``The Coast Starlight.'' They are among the
last of the great trains that cross the United States, recalling a
time when rail travel was the only way to go. Even today, a
well-planned rail journey can recapture much of the old romance of
the rails. There are multi-day, cross-country routes in the United
States on Amtrak and in Canada on Via Rail, as well as two-day
daylight trips through the _ on the Rocky Mountaineer to choose
from.
 &HT;    Train travel is all about slowing down and making the journey a
part of the vacation. Fortunately, the comfort level has risen of
late. The much-beleaguered Amtrak has updated its cars and improved
levels of service and food in the past five years. While coach
travel remains an economical option, travel by sleeper car can
really transform a train journey.
 &HT;    Sleepers require first class fares on Amtrak and include all
meals. Standard bedrooms have two reclining seats that convert to a
bed. Deluxe bedrooms, which are about 30 percent more expensive and
come with a private bathroom, are designed for two passengers and
feature a sofa and armchair that convert to an upper and lower
berth.
 &HT;    Amtrak pricing is rather complicated and not unlike airline
pricing. There's a set charge for a sleeper compartment, and then
fare charges for each passenger which are based on a variety of
factors, including the season and the day of the week. Contact
Amtrak (60 Massachusetts Ave. N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002;
800-USA-RAIL/www.amtrak.com) for current pricing. Note that making
multiple stops is a popular option, as is the North America Rail
Pass, which provides 30 days of unlimited travel in both the U.S.
and Canada for a 90-day period.
 &HT;    What are the most exciting overnight routes in the United
States? Start with ``The Sunset Limited,'' which runs from Orlando
to Los Angeles by way of New Orleans and Houston, some 3,000 miles
across the county, an eight-state journey from Florida to
California. Then there's ``The Empire Builder,'' which leaves from
Chicago and goes to either Portland or Seattle. This train through
Big Sky country brings travelers face to face with the Bear Paw
Mountains, Glacier National Park, the Rockies and the Cascades.
 &HT;    The ``California Zephyr'' runs from Chicago through three
mountain ranges, two deserts and alongside the Colorado River for a
couple of hundred miles before arriving in greater San Francisco.
Many diehard train buffs as well as first-timers claim that this is
the most beautiful train ride in the United States. From the
breadbasket of America to the Rockies, from the Wasatch Mountains
and into Salt Lake City, the train continues to Reno, the mile-high
Donner Pass and then down to Sacramento and into Oakland.
 &HT;    ``The Coast Starlight'' runs from Los Angeles to Seattle. It's
Amtrak's most popular train and it literally hugs the Pacific
coast, from southern California all the way up to Santa Barbara,
and then to San Francisco, into Oregon and finally Washington. Only
``The Coast Starlight'' has the Pacific Parlour Car, a customized
lounge car for first class travelers.
 &HT;    ``The Cardinal'' links Washington D.C. with Chicago via the
riverfront city of Cincinnati, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia and along the New River Gorge in West Virginia, with a
U.S. Forest Ranger providing commentary at apt moments.
 &HT;    On VIA Rail Canada's (P.O. Box 8116, Station A, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada H3C 3N3; 800-561-9181 www.viarail.ca) trains in the
East, Easterly Class offers private bedrooms with a bathroom and a
shared shower while semi-private seating converts to a curtained
berth by night. On VIA Rail trains in Western Canada, Silver &AMP; Blue
Class bedrooms sleep two with a private bathroom. Less expensive is
semi-private seating that converts to curtained berths at night,
with shared bathrooms.
 &HT;    In Canada, ``The Ocean'' is the train that runs between
Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The scenic way to pass
from French-speaking Quebec into the Maritimes, this train speeds
along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, past Riviere-du-Loup
through the Matapedia Valley to Baie des Chaleurs. From there, it
continues on to New Brunswick, through Moncton, into Amherst, Nova
Scotia and finally to Halifax.
 &HT;    ``The Canadian'' runs from Toronto, Ontario to Vancouver,
British Columbia. The most famous train ride in North America
crosses two-thirds of Canada, from the endless forest of Ontario to
the surreal plains of Manitoba and the wheat fields of Saskatchewan
before reaching the heart of the Rockies in Jasper, where elk
wander through the streets. Continuing through the Rockies, the
train cuts through the high desert of British Columbia before
reaching the coastal rain forest and Vancouver, a journey of 2,770
miles.
 &HT;    Finally, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station Street,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) makes two-day daylight trips through the
Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer, traveling from Vancouver
to either Jasper, Banff or Calgary, Alberta, with overnight hotel
stay in Kamloops, British Columbia. For Signature Service, prices
start at $362 per person and include the overnight stay and some
meals.

INTRODUCING ROD SERLING'S `NIGHT GALLERY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After ``The Twilight Zone,'' the classic TV series
that ran from 1959 to 1964, its creator, Rod Serling, crept into
the ``Night Gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   That series, preceded by a 1969 TV movie, ran from 1970 to 1973
but never captured the imagination of viewers and the culture as
``Zone'' did, but the anthology did produce a number of gems.
Serling would introduce each of the short, supernatural vignettes
from an art gallery containing bizarre paintings and statues.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alfred Hitchcock, Serling, who died at 50 in 1975, became a
well-known personality thanks to the introductions he did for
``Zone'' and ``Gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man
...'' he would intone at the beginning of each ``Zone'' episode as
the creepy music grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   Serling first made his mark as a writer in the days of live
television, winning one of his five Emmys for ``Requiem for a
Heavyweight.'' Most people forget that amid Serling's sense of the
macabre and supernatural were odd flights of fancy, and the tales
sometimes had a gallows sense of humor. He also worked in films,
adapting ``Heavyweight' as well as writing screenplays for ``Seven
Days in May'' and ``Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zone'' and ``Gallery'' are both notable for early appearances
by film heavyweights. Robert Redford played the angel of death in a
``Zone'' episode, while a 22-year-old filmmaker named Steven
Spielberg directed one of ``Gallery's'' pilot episodes, ``Darker
Than Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of being in television's version of ``The
Twilight Zone'' _ syndicated (and truncated) reruns _ original
``Gallery'' episodes are being released on video by re-tv. Fans can
get ``Rod Serling's Night Gallery: The Collector's Edition'' only
by calling (800) 638-2922 or by accessing the Web site,
www.columbiahouse.com/vl.
</P>
<P>
   The initial ``Night Gallery'' video (there'll be more) includes
four episodes _ ``They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar,'' ``The
Last Laurel,'' ``The Caterpillar'' and ``Little Girl Lost.'' This
is available for $4.95, plus shipping and handling. Subsequent
volumes will be available every four to six weeks to subscribers at
$19.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Paramount is releasing ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' on
video. Being the ninth of the ``Star Trek'' films, it was less than
scintillating. (For some reason, the even-numbered ones are
better.) But it might just mean that the ``Trek'' film series _
even with the ``Next Generation'' _ is running out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you want to see the ``Next Generation'' when it first
was tearing off into the final frontier, re-tv _ it first aired in
1987 _ it, too, is coming out with a collector edition. From
William Shatner's histrionics as Capt. James T. Kirk, the ``Trek''
folks turned to Royal Shakespeare veteran Patrick Stewart to take
over the new Enterprise. Though the show's creator, Gene
Roddenberry, essentially kept the feeling of the series the same as
the original, which ran between 1966 and 1969, ``Next'' developed
some intersting co-ed relationships. This was in contrast to the
original's weird boys club of Kirk, Spock and McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Star Trek'' needed another boost, it added ``Deep Space
Nine'' in 1992, with Avery Brooks, about a space station on the
edge of the galaxy. Like ``Next,'' ``Nine'' is coming out on video
from re-tv. To purchase them, call the number or go to the Web site
noted above.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for other old television shows, re-tv also
has collector's editions that can be found at the Web site,
including ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``All in the Family,'' ``I Love
Lucy,'' ``Sanford &AMP; Son'' and ``Gunsmoke.'' &QL;

ACCIDENTS DIM IMAGE OF APACHES' INVINCIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that two US Apache helicopters have crashed in Albania
without a shot being fired, the question arises: What fate awaits
the other 22 choppers if they cross the Kosovo border and enter the
war?
</P>
<P>
   This concern explains a good part of why the Apaches, also known
as the AH-64As, have been held back for now. Helicopters generally
are vulnerable machines. A good shot at one of its rotary blades
can put the craft out of commission. And the Yugoslav army is
believed to have plenty of shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Apaches are better protected than most
helicopters. They are somewhat armored, protecting them from
gunfire, though not from missiles. They are also built to absorb
the impact of most crashes, making it less likely that the pilot
dies as a result.
</P>
<P>
   However, in another sense, the Apaches are more vulnerable.
Their mission is to attack enemy tanks and troops, which means they
fly in low. Since that puts them in the line of antiaircraft fire,
they have special instruments that let them fly in very low _
hugging the terrain, popping up above hills or treetops, firing
their weapons, and ducking back down.
</P>
<P>
   But flying so low, especially at night or in unfamiliar
territory, heightens the chance of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, according to US Army data, Apaches have crashed, on
average, two to three times as often as cargo- and troop-carrying
helicopters _ four crashes per 100,000 hours of flight, compared
with 2.2 for the Ch-47 Chinooks and 1.5 for the UH-60 Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, accidents tend to increase as the Army gears up for
war. In 1991, the year of the Persian Gulf War, Apaches crashed at
a rate of 8.76 per 100,000 hours of flight, more than double the
normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, so far, five Apaches have crashed in 63,000 hours of
flight-time _ which translates to 7.94 per 100,000 hours, again
double the usual rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you mobilize for operations, you fly more hours, more
realistic training missions, lower altitudes, more often at
night,'' an Army officer said Wednesday. ``It's no surprise we're
seeing more accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the Army relies on such delicate machines is a story going
back to the years just after World War II, when the US Air Force
split off from the Army and became an independent branch of the
armed forces. The chiefs of the two services met at Key West, Fla.,
and divvied up the ``roles and missions'' that had been performed
by what used to be called the Army Air Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Key West accord, as it came to be called, the Air
Force got control of combat airplanes and the Army was left with
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force had little interest in buying many planes for the
mission of supporting Army troops on the ground. The atomic bomb
seemed to be the weapon of the future. It seemed best delivered by
air power. So, for the next couple decades, that became the Air
Force's chief preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Army chiefs still saw a role for ground troops, but since
they could not count on the Air Force to provide support from the
air, they built up a huge force of helicopters _ even knowing they
would be less lethal and more vulnerable than low-flying airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   This interservice tension persists. As recently as the Gulf War,
the Air Force's A-10 Thunderbolt attack planes, which had been
built specifically to support ground troops, were not included in
the original war-plan. The US commander, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
had to insist that A-10s be involved. Afterwards, official analyses
showed they destroyed more Iraqi tanks and armored personnel
carriers than any other kind of plane.
</P>
<P>
   The analyses also revealed that the A-10s flew 7,983 combat
sorties in the Gulf War, yet only four of the planes were lost to
enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   This was fewer than the six US helicopters that were lost during
training exercises in the four months leading up to that war,
before a shot was fired.

 &HT;    A GENERATION LATER, GERMANY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GENOCIDE
ISSUE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 9 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In the half-century since World War II, Germans have
been taught two maxims: No more war; no more genocide.
</P>
<P>
   With the war in Yugoslavia, these principles are in deep and
unresolved conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since being defeated in World War II, German
forces are engaged in armed military action. An estimated 3,000
German soldiers are in Macedonia as part of a multinational
security force and perhaps as an expeditionary force into Kosovo.
Since the start of the war in late March, 14 Luftwaffe Tornado
warplanes have been flying combat missions over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Riveted by the images of an estimated 1.5 million Kosovar
Albanian refugees forced from their homes -- images that are
hauntingly reminiscent of Nazi purges of Jews and others -- Germans
support doing something.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the German government has been a leader in bringing
humanitarian aid to Kosovar Albanian refugees in Macedonia, and
taken in nearly 10,000 of them to ease the burden on the cash-poor
Macedonian government. And last week(CQ), German officials were out
front in bringing Russia to the table to narrow its differences
with Western allies over a future international force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, still for many Germans it remains unthinkable that any
efforts should involve force.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls reveal this duality: Most Germans favor NATO
airstrikes, but even more oppose a ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we should contribute,'' said Ernest Roeger, 68, a
retired Berlin chemical engineer. ``We could build up hospitals,
refugee camps and help the people build up their country afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we should not take military action,'' Roeger said.
``Because of German history and because Germany has already dropped
bombs on Belgrade, there should be no Germans among the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   This thinking spans the generations. In Dresden, a city
decimated by Allied bombing near the end of World War II,
15-year-old Melanie Eberle pauses from a sundae at a McDonald's to
profess her horror at the thought of Germans taking up arms.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, the military is an emergency assistance force
rather than a fighting force trained to capture objectives and kill
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would never be justified for us to go into another country
and start shooting people,'' said Melanie, who is the only one
among her half-dozen friends sitting at the table to express a
willingness to join the military.
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht Polenz, a senior member of the foreign affairs
committee in the German parliament, said Germans view war
differently from other Europeans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans have come to equate war and doing wrong as the same
thing,'' he said. ``For other nations, war can connote liberation
or coming to the aid of allies, but for Germans, it means having
done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany is so bereft of a military culture that there are no
medals to honor war heroes. The traditional Iron Crosses -- a medal
won by Adolf Hitler in the World War I -- were abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for many, the presence of German forces represents evidence
that the country is at last part of the mainstream. ``I don't know
very much about the Luftwaffe, but I am thrilled to see them fly,''
said Gebhardt von Moltke, the German ambassador to Britain, who was
a child during the last war. ``It means we have finally been
forgiven and can have equal rights and responsibilities with the
rest of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief that Germany is fighting now because of its
obligation to NATO as opposed to some national aspiration or
interest seems to ease the concerns of many. ``We're an integral
part of NATO,'' said Matthius Griebel, the director of the Dresden
city museum and a survivor of the 1945 fire-bombing. ``When we have
benefitted from NATO security then we must also take part in an
action such as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, other Germans remain deeply opposed to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ilona Rothe of Berlin has formed a group called Mothers Against
the War. She says she has received more than 1,000 phone calls from
people who agree with her assertion that the war must be stopped
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have touched a nerve in Germany,'' she said. ``I hear the
women crying on the telephone for their sons or their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 24-year-old son is among the German troops in Macedonia --
where they have built and operate the best of all the refugee camps
there. So far, Rothe's son has seen no action. ``I heard an
interview with a Serbian mother, in which she said, 'I want my son,
I don't care about (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic.' That's
how I feel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder(CQ), the first German
leader with no personal experience with World War II, acknowledged
the dilemma in a recent magazine interview. But he argued that this
generation of Germans must not be in the position of trying to
explain to later ones why they did nothing to respond to the plight
of the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be able to say: We did what was possible and
right,'' Schroeder told Der Spiegel. ``Especially as Germans, our
response must be clear: We must never again allow murder,
expulsions and deportations to be tolerated.''

THE YUGOSLAV WAR IS OVER, AND THE WEST LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday: ``We are not only not going to stop the bombing,'' says
Defense Secretary William Cohen, ``we are going to intensify the
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday: President Clinton tells reporters that ``under the right
circumstances, we would be willing to have a bombing pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: ``We have to be part of the force,'' insists State
Department spokesman James Rubin, referring to the peacekeeping
brigade that will secure the Kosovars' right to return. ``And it
has to be a NATO force.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday: The United States, Clinton says, is ``open to a broad
security force. We would welcome the United Nations' embrace of
such a security force. . . . (which could include) the Russians,
perhaps the Ukrainians, perhaps others who come from the Orthodox
tradition, who have close ties to the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Slice by slice, the Clinton capitulation is underway. No longer
does the president demand unconditional compliance with NATO's
terms, as he did when this fight began. Instead he says, ``There's
plenty to talk about.'' No longer does he vow to bomb Serbia until
Slobodan Milosevic surrenders. Instead he is open to bombing
pauses, and to negotiations with Serbia's hardline ally, Russia. No
longer does he declare that a ``NATO force'' or even a ``NATO-led
force'' police the peace in Kosovo. Instead he throws the door open
to a UN force so broad as to comprise even pro-Serb, anti-Albanian
Russians and Ukrainians.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will all be over but the arranging of the fig leaves.
And on every important principle, NATO and the United States will
have lost.
</P>
<P>
   The West went to war to compel Slobodan Milosevic to sign the
Rambouillet treaty, to restore Kosovo's autonomy, and to halt the
brutal pogroms Serbian forces were unleashing against Kosovar
civilians. Today Rambouillet is dead and a million Kosovars have
been torched and terrorized out of their homes. The most homicidal
dictator in Europe dared the world's mightiest democracy to stop
him, and the mighty democracy choked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's means were stunningly unsuited to his ends. From the
start he ruled out a ground war, which signaled Milosevic that his
ground war could proceed. The president invoked Hitler's horrors in
making the case against Serbia, yet never called for the overthrow
of the Serbian regime. He should have labeled Milosevic a war
criminal, should have notified the world that the fighting would go
on until the dicator was dead or behind bars. Instead he talked
about ``degrading'' the Yugoslav military until a ``permissive
environment'' was achieved, and scarcely mentioned Milosevic at
all.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of prosecuting this war to save Kosovo, NATO
managed to send a laser-guided bomb ripping through a convoy of
Kosovar refugees and vaporized a bus _ possibly two buses _ filled
with civilians. These were tragic accidents, of course. But they
were also the sort of disasters that occur when you try to stop
expulsions and massacres on the ground with F-16s flying at 15,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In the Independent, a British daily, Robert Fisk recently
compared the allies' approach to Kosovo's suffering innocents to
that of a passerby who sees someone being victimized across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``What NATO has done . . . has been to stay on the other side of
the road, to make a note of the criminal's address, and to throw
stones through the window of his home later that night,'' Fisk
wrote. ``Not a single NATO life has been lost in five weeks of war
. . . because we do not regard the catastrophe of the Kosovo
Albanians as worth a single NATO life.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the United States to crush Milosevic will have
grave repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   America's standing in NATO has plummeted. The allies launched
the first non-defensive military action in NATO's history, despite
misgivings, because they trusted Washington's leadership. That
trust was squandered by a White House that turned out to have no
strategy for victory and no plan for stopping Serbia's ethnic
``cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Clinton, the world will be less likely to defer to
American leadership from now on. In the last six years, Washington
has shown itself unable to defeat the warlords of Somalia, unable
to curtail North Korea's nuclear weapons program, unable to destroy
Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden, and _ above all _ unable to
outmaneuver Saddam Hussein. Now comes the debacle in Yugoslavia. If
there was any remaining doubt that the Colossus of Desert Storm had
feet of clay, the events of the last 45 days have blown it away.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was not obliged to go to war _ or whatever the
term is for an enterprise in which the overriding priority is to
keep soldiers' boots from getting muddy _ to arrest the
depredations in Kosovo. But having chosen to do so, it was obliged
to fight to win. The Clinton administration's refusal to take that
obligation seriously will cheer barbarians everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs are still falling on Yugoslavia, but the choreography
of arranging a cease-fire and cobbling together a deal is underway.
Before long the bombs will stop. Milosevic and his junta will not
be obliterated. The Kosovars will not be made whole. As the 20th
century ends, it is still possible for tyrants _ even in Europe _
even at NATO's doorstep _ to drive out minorities at the point of a
bayonet. Such is Clinton's legacy to the world. History will not be
kind.

   JERUSALEM _ Yitzak Soudri's vision of Israel is different from
the one most Americans imagine from afar.
</P>
<P>
   For Soudri, a spokesman for the ultra-religious Shas Party,
Israel is not the mythic Zionist refuge, where pioneers band
together for common survival.
</P>
<P>
   He sees what is often called the ``tribal'' Israel. In that
Israeli reality, Shas and their supporters, the ``Sephardim'' of
Asian and North African descent, battle daily against the
``Ashkenazim'' elites from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start from the assumption that there's a culture
war in the country,'' Soudri says. ``In the last 15 years, Shas has
been destroying everything (the elites) have tried to create . . .
what we're doing frightens every secular Ashkenazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the May 17 elections for parliament and prime minister are
intensifying Israel's battles between the tribes. Tribes that seem
to be growing farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are remarkably similar to each other compared to
Israelis,'' says Michael Walzer, who studies Israel for the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``Among the
(countries) I know, Israel is the most polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's current divisions are no surprise. The country was born
only 50 years ago. It has since been rapidly populated by
immigrants speaking different languages, socialist ideologues
fighting for liberation and ultra-religious Jews seeking biblical
land.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and the other Sephardim, olive-skinned and usually working
class, clash with the fair-haired and wealthier Askenazim.
Ultra-Religious Jews in black suits and fedoras attack secular Jews
in tie-dye. The growing Russian and Arab minorities cluster in
their own ethnic parties seeking influence as tie-breakers among
the bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   The population of 6 million is changing. Religious Jews and
Arabs have large families, so their numbers increase. A million
Soviet immigrants have arrived since 1989. And, Israelis are what
one pollster calls, ``calcified voters.'' Repeatedly, Sephardim and
the religious Jews back right-wingers, while Ashkenazim, secular
Jews and Arabs back left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   They battle daily in the press, politics and sometimes the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group thinks they only have to worry about themselves.
Extremism is growing,'' said Orthodox Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, leader of
a small mixed party of religious and secular leaders. ``I think the
majority is sick of this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   But, moderation does not look likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Center Party, formed to bridge cultural and political gaps,
is floundering. Extreme religious parties are flexing their muscle
with street protests. The small, combative Change Party benefits
from the backlash by attacking the religious, their military
exemptions and their use of government money for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were defending the state, somebody stole it from
behind our backs,'' says Change candidate Tommy Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   The major candidates for prime minister, right-wing incumbent
Benjamin Netanyahu and left-wing Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak,
are tuning their appeals to ethnic ears. Sometimes they try to
remind people of the common good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has publicly apologized for historic mistreatment of the
Sephardim by his Ashkenazim. Both parties run campaign ads with
Russian subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   But, this week, a comedian at a Labor Party rally made fun of
the Sephardim -- calling them ``rabble'' -- and Netanyahu's Likud
Party turned it into a campaign commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu later toured a produce market, reportedly saying,
``these so-called elites, they hate the people. They hate
Sephardim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardim make up about 35 percent of the voters -- more
than the Ashkenazim -- and the parliamentary system increases their
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Since only a majority of parliament can recall a prime minister,
any leader has to build a coalition of several small parties to
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the country's major issue, relations with it's Arab
neighbors, can be decided almost as a by-product of the tribal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A prime minister can either find himself hostage to the many
demands of small parties or exploit the competition between them to
steer the country toward solutions with the Arabs -- something most
Israelis support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of leverage,'' said Israeli political
scientist Shmuel(cq) Sandler. ``You can buy them off.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shas wants more government money for religious
schools and Shas welfare services. The peace process is less
important.
</P>
<P>
   When left-winger Yitzhak Rabin agreed to their demands, they
joined his coalition and helped him ratify the historic Oslo Peace
Accords. In 1996, when Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to their demands,
they bolstered his coalition and helped him bring the Oslo process
to a tense standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shas finds new competition from other ethnic parties.
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian party is running commercials in Russian
exhorting voters to give it more parliamentary seats than Shas.
</P>
<P>
   With that clout, the ad promises, it will be able to force the
next prime minister to remove the Shas leadership of the
immigration ministry and install a secular Russian in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to give (the ministry) to us just as a
gesture,'' says Natan Sharansky, leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its demands, the Russians would set aside their
hawkish views on the peace process. They backed the dovish Rabin in
1992. Seeking a better deal, they flipped and backed the hawkish
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But, prime ministers can also find themselves at what many call
the ``blackmail'' of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The religious parties, for example, threatened to bring down
Netanyahu's government if he backed proposals to recognize the less
traditional Reform and Conservative forms of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's predicament is summed up artfully by an animated
political commercial for the left-wing Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   It shows an exhausted Netanyahu dancing to a caricature
``Klezmer'' band of notable religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the tribes choose the music and the prime
minister dances.
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu supporters found it amusing. But, given the tense
political climate and Israel's tribal voting habits, few will
change their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it brought a smile to people's faces,'' said Meretz
parliamentarian Nomi Chazan. ``That's something.''

   JERUSALEM _ The May 17 elections for Israeli prime minister, and
the possible June 1 run-off, are expected to be split along ethnic

BLACK WOMEN GRAB REINS TO STEER DEMOCRATIC RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not so long ago, Regena Thomas and other members of
the ``Colored Girls Club,'' as the tight-knit group of black female
political operatives call themselves, watched a parade of their
white male counterparts assume key roles in Democratic Party
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``white guys'' made the big bucks and sat ``at the
right hand of God,'' so to speak, Thomas said, ``we were the ones
who got called the last 30 days of the campaign, when all the money
had been spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was going to be our lives for the rest of our
days,'' she chuckled. ``But now, here we are at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   A record number of black women are at the starting gate of
political campaigns this year, taking charge of strategy for the
Democratic Party and one of its presidential candidates. They are
the George Stephanopouloses and James Carvilles for the last
election of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Their brash, self-confident, shoe-leather style of grass-roots
politicking has become an important cachet.
</P>
<P>
   This cadre of women includes Thomas, who was recently elevated
to national campaign director at the Democratic National Committee;
Donna Brazile, who is Vice President Al Gore's new deputy campaign
manager and national political director; and Minyon Moore, who was
promoted to assistant to the president and director of White House
political affairs earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the group are Carlottia Scott, the Democratic National
Committee's new chief of politics, and Alison McLaurin, who at 29
is the youngest member of the informal and loosely organized
Colored Girls Club. Despite her age, McLaurin is the veteran,
having been political director at the Democratic Governors
Association since last June.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of McLaurin, all the women cut their teeth in
national politics on Jesse Jackson's unsuccessful presidential bids
in 1984 and 1988. Collectively they have traveled every state in
the nation as campaign workers, and their combined experience spans
local, state, national and, in some cases, overseas elections.
</P>
<P>
   With recent polls showing that women are leaving the Democratic
Party, these political directors are helping craft a message not
only to bring back women and attract the huge swath of black voters
who are registered and don't vote, but also to reach those in rural
areas and those who are young and alienated from the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our being here says is that this is a very important
election, and it is so important that you have to disturb the
comfortable,'' Moore said. ``It has caused people to want to get
back out here and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these women have been on the political scene for years _
knocking on doors, shaking hands and kissing babies. They say it is
now their turn to be front and center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to contribute to victories in the elections. No
one's doing them any favors,'' said David Bositis, a senior
research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a black think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Political pollster Ron Lester agreed: ``They have paid their
dues.''
</P>
<P>
   After Democrats got their ``butts kicked'' in 1994, as McLaurin
put it, the women weighed in to help the party recover. Thomas, for
example, was dispatched to New Jersey in 1996 to help
then-Representative Robert G. Torricelli campaign for an open
Senate seat, which he won.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile, as a senior political adviser for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, lead a stealth campaign to reach
black voters in last year's midterm election. Democrats bucked
historical trends for an off-year election, picking up five House
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women played critical roles going into November's
elections, and so they have been and are being rewarded for the
roles that they played,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn, a
South Carolina Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Black
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   DNC Chairman Roy Romer, a former governor of Colorado, said,
``There was never any pre-planned strategy'' to make political
history by picking black women for the campaign jobs. ``These
decisions were arrived at because the people are competent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bositis, however, said that taken together, their presence might
benefit Gore if he becomes the presidential nominee. ``It's clear
that they have experience in black politics, and the fact is that
the black vote is going to be important both for the Democrats and
certainly for Al Gore,'' he said. ``Between 55 and 60 percent of
the black population is in the South. ... If Gore takes the South,
it doesn't matter what happens in the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brazile, ``We not only know black people, but we know white
people, too, and that makes us very valuable. We will outwork
anybody on the political scene today, other than our candidates,
who we will work to death.''
</P>
<P>
   These women are beneficiaries of the groundwork laid by Fannie
Lou Hamer, a Mississippi voting rights worker who pressed the
Democratic Party in the early 1960s to give African-Americans a
seat at the table. More recently Jackson; the late Ronald Brown,
who was Commerce secretary and the former DNC chairman; and Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman are helping show that blacks know what to
do once they get that seat.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the new roles these women play, rather than being
revolutionary, have evolved in the party, Bositis points out.
</P>
<P>
   After working on the Jackson campaigns, most of the women
ventured into other presidential campaigns, including those of
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt and former Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis, as well as the campaign of Senator Edward
M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jackson's campaigns that ``taught you not to freak
out over the fact that you have less than 48 hours to pull off a
miracle,'' said Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   Their new jobs have forced one change when the club meets for
their frequent Friday night fish fries. Now, instead of cooking the
fish, one of the women brings it already prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Having her ``sisters'' with her, Scott said, ``brings a new
dynamic to the whole of the Democratic Party structure. It's about
us as a collective, as a family, and what we do is bigger than us
as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Moore: ``We've always had the company of each other. Now we
have the accountability.''

TEEN BREAKS BARRIERS FOR COLLEGE GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She had seen it a hundred times before. All around Nora Cadena,
girls were getting pregnant and leaving high school.
</P>
<P>
   Or they were having their babies and trying to finish anyway,
dragging their educations out over extra years, against long odds,
and in spite of politicians' caricatures of them as shiftless and
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   But she was different. She had stayed out of trouble. School had
always been easy for her. And she was going to college.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 16, she got pregnant, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed in myself. I couldn't believe it,''
Cadena recalled. ``I said, God wouldn't do this, this can't happen.
I have everything going for myself.' I thought it would all be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over. Indeed, come September, Cadena will leave
her parents in San Fernando, Calif., and travel with her baby
Chassitty, now 9 months old, to MIT. She will be one of only 10
undergraduate parents out of a student population of almost 5,000,
and one of the few freshmen to bring a child to school with her.
</P>
<P>
   And to attend MIT, she is turning down University of California
at Berkeley, University of Southern California, California Lutheran
University, and possibly Harvard, where she is on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   When she unpacks her bags in Cambridge this fall, Cadena already
will be freighted with more responsibilities than most of her
classmates will face for years.
</P>
<P>
   But she will also be armed with many of the advantages with
which the luckiest students arrive at the country's best schools:
strong parents, teachers who refused to write her off, and a large
helping of natural ability.
</P>
<P>
   America has the highest teenage pregnancy rate of all developed
countries _ nearly double that of Britain _ with a million
adolescent girls becoming pregnant each year. And even though US
pregnancy rates have been declining since the early 1990s, the
decreases have barely touched Hispanic teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Cadena, who is Hispanic, saw many of her classmates become
pregnant and leave the school, or stay and ``just get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were also battling tough economic situations, as was she.
Most of the community where she lives with her parents, both of
whom lost their jobs earlier this year, live below the poverty
line. One of her teachers told the Los Angeles Times that half of
his 9th graders drop out or return to Mexico each year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as many children from difficult circumstances do with
enough support and smarts, Cadena shone as a student, taking six
advanced-placement courses and managing a 4.284 grade point
average.
</P>
<P>
   But when she got pregnant, the academic success and the strong
family life counted for little. She, too, felt the sting of the
stereotypes, with strangers on the street calling her names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'd go out to the store, every time I'm walking
down the street with (Chassitty), people would stare and comment,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said most of the teachers in her school expected her resolve
to slip after the baby was born, but quickly came around. Cadena
took a total of 10 days off for her child's birth, and even came to
school three days after Chassitty was born to pick up an
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Since her parents weren't working, she also took a job at a
discount clothing store, where she worked for 25 hours a week while
raising her baby and continuing her studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I matured really quickly,'' she said. ``I realized the
importance of getting an education, and this is how I'm going to be
able to advance myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the persistence that got her to one of the most
academically demanding colleges in the country be enough to help
Cadena survive four years there? She will, after all, be bringing
up her baby alone, thousands of miles from the parents who have
been so vital to her and Chassitty's success so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult,'' she said. ``I'm wondering if
it's all going to catch up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadena has friends at MIT already, which is partly why she first
applied there. She is already lining up child care. And MIT has
offered her family housing. She will get by on scholarships and
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be the first time an 18-year-old has come in as a
parent, but it's unusual,'' said Kathy Simons, MIT Family Resource
Center coadministrator. The institute offers help with medical
care, and flexibility in courseload for parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Cadena's biggest hurdle may be back in California.
Chassitty's father has threatened to sue to keep Cadena from
leaving the state with his child.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gina Ocon, the California mother whose former partner tried
to keep her from attending Harvard with their infant daughter, and
who eventually won the right to attend Harvard, Cadena has had
offers of legal help from several women's advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I have a lot of people helping me,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The question does not often occur to your average dad, but for
Ned Strong it became all-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the Amazon begin?
</P>
<P>
   The mighty 4,000-mile river, which runs from the Peruvian Andes
through Brazil to the Atlantic Ocean, holds more water than the
Nile, the Yangtze and the Mississippi together _ a full fifth of
all the world's flowing water.
</P>
<P>
   But it starts _ somewhere _ as a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Just where has been a matter of some contention for decades. A
few weeks ago, Strong, 46, his 13-year-old son Peter, a hiking
partner, Lew Scotten, altitude specialist Dr. Michael Wiedman,
Strong's brother Don, and National Geographic photographer Zbigniew
Bdzak headed for Peru, on their own search for that place.
</P>
<P>
   They carried with them sophisticated Global Positioning System
(GPS) satellite tracking equipment, camping gear, freeze-dried
dinners and a flag from the New York Explorers Club.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks and 85 cans of tuna later, they are back, armed with a
computer-load of figures which, when synthesized, will settle the
question of where the Amazon begins, once and for all. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of late 20th-century exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Strong's son, Peter, was 9 when his father started talking about
finding the source of the Amazon. The elder Strong had been on a
hiking trip in Ecuador with Scotten, and the two were determined to
follow the river to its beginning. Peter begged to go along back
then, but was told he was too young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took so long for him to set a date to do it that I got to
go,'' said the seventh-grader at Clarke Middle School in Lexington,
Mass. Until this trip, he had been camping with his father in New
Hampshire, and once at Yellowstone, but never anywhere more exotic.
</P>
<P>
   And while the adults had to train for the high altitudes of the
Andes, the 13-year-old long-jumper and 200-meter runner was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best hiker among us,'' said Ned Strong, who heads
the Latin American Scholars exchange program at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The team flew into Arequipa, southeast of Lima, then traveled
for two days to get to their base camp. They spent the first week
training for the altitude, then set up camp at the Lloqueta river,
an area where expeditions before theirs have agreed lies the origin
of the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to determine what was the longest stream of
water that feeds into the Amazon,'' said Ned Strong. ``A lot of
people have gone up into this area, but because of altitude
sickness, they weren't able to do the survey work that we did. And
we were the first group to go up there with a sophisticated GPS
system to chart the exact location.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went farther than previous expeditions,'' said Wiedman,
calling from Peru. ``And we got measurements they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For four days, the party mapped each of the tributaries that fed
the River Lloqueta, which itself eventually runs into the Amazon:
the longest one would be the source of the giant river.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, they rose at 6, and followed the brooks toward
the peaks of three mountains, Mount Mismi, Mount Cutiti, and Mount
Quehuisha. At 18,000 feet, there was a surprising amount of
activity, the explorers said: villagers from lower country grazing
their sheep, llamas and alpacas on the grass and mosses up on the
otherwise lunar hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just surprising that such a harsh environment would
support that many plants,'' Ned Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Every day at 2 p.m. it snowed. And every night, after trout, or
canned tuna, or freeze-dried meals, the group huddled in their
sleeping bags and tents in below-freezing temperatures, asleep by 7
or 8 p.m. Peter used his spare time to rehearse lines from his
school's upcoming production of ``Snow White.'' (He plays the
prince.)
</P>
<P>
   After all of the tributaries had been mapped, the group
celebrated with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Now the real work, and the controversy, begins.
</P>
<P>
   Many parties have been to River Lloqueta watershed area before.
In 1971, National Geographic writer and photographer Loren McIntyre
found a catchment area just below the peak of Mount Mismi, later
named Lake McIntyre, and for years that was agreed upon as the
source of the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, a Polish crew headed by Virginia-based adventurer
and environmentalist Piotr Chmielinski named the source at a
different point.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts-based team isn't sure yet where the longest
source will be. They've narrowed it down to two spots _ one close
to Lake McIntyre, and another along a different stream, the river
Ccaccansa, which flows from the top of Mount Cutiti. When the
calculations are finished, the source-point will emerge, they say.
In the end, they may add only yards to McIntyre's original
source-point.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very modern kind of expedition: the kind that ends not in
a huge, startling discovery, but in a cache of information to be
synthesized later. Just about every summit has been reached, every
lost tribe found. All the flags have been stuck.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is the hair-splitting expedition, that which yields
not new, but better, information. And notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why keep climbing Everest, or going across the Atlantic in a
rowboat? In a sense, they're stunts, and you try to outstunt
somebody else and you get your 15 minutes of fame,'' said McIntyre,
who at 82 has grown impatient with the revisionist explorers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a crew on Mount Everest right now trying to establish
its exact height using GPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Livingstone's day, it was kind of a romantic situation,''
said McIntyre. ``But there's not much of that kind of thing going
on in the world now. Today you go to the Discovery Channel and
dozens of (expeditions) are going on just to provide adventure
fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Strongs feel no less adventuresome than Dr. David
Livingstone, and their findings promise to be no less controversial
than that famous 19th century quest for the source of the Nile,
during which Livingstone disappeared, and over which competing
explorers practically dueled.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon explorers disagree not only on where the source of the
South American river is, but also on how to define it. The river
changes too much to allow for absolute pronouncements on its
origin, said McIntyre. ``The Amazon changes from one moment to the
next,'' he said. ``It's tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   And this latest group is aware that their own findings will also
be a matter of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to measure from the top of the watershed
permanently in snow and ice, then that would be the source,'' said
Ned Strong. ``If you want to measure from where the water starts,
then that's the source.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let the debate happen,'' he said. ``We just wanted to
provide the data.''

DNA AND THE END OF PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the major concerns of the information age is that
personal privacy will be erased by technology. ``Privacy is
doomed,'' The Economist magazine said last week, citing the
proliferation of computers as the principal cause. But it is not
computers that will end privacy, although they will accelerate the
process. What will end privacy in the next 10 years is the science
of genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Venter, whose genomic research is literally transforming
the scientific landscape, said last week that he thought ``genetic
identification cards'' would be ubiquitous in as few as five years.
He had no illusions about what that meant. ``It raises the issue of
civil liberties,'' said Venter, ``as never before.''
</P>
<P>
   Genomics, in the words of Harvard University researcher Juan
Enriquez, ``is the discipline that maps and tries to understand the
DNA instructions that build and sustain life. All living creatures
and each cell within these organisms contains a set of DNA
instructions known as a genome. This is the source code for all
forms of life on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the work of Venter and his colleagues at the Celera
Genomics Group to decode the human genome; to sequence, in
Enriquez's exact phrase, ``the three billion nucleotide base
pairs'' in each of us. Sequencing leads to an understanding of
structure. Structure leads to an understanding of function. And
therein lies the key to understanding the evolution of life.

<P>
   Venter's undertaking is of such vast import and ambition that
one is tempted to write it off as science fiction. It is not
science fiction. What he and his colleagues at Celera are dealing
with and dealing in are not just the fundamentals of evolution but
the ability to alter that process. As Claire Fisher, Venter's wife
and scientific partner, said last summer ``In the next ten years we
will see some of the most extraordinary discoveries in the history
of science. We can give evolution a shove in the right direction or
in the wrong direction depending on whether we know what we are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter is racing to decode the human genome by the end of 2001.
In that race, he is competing with the Human Genome Project, a
publicly funded $3 billion global scientific inquiry that is
sponsored, in large part, by the United States government. Once
both projects are completed, our understanding of why someone is
asthmatic and someone else is not, why someone suffers depression
and someone else does not, why someone suffers from high blood
pressure and someone else does not, will surpass all previous
insight.
</P>
<P>
   This research will lead to a whole new world of medicine,
pharmacology, agriculture, chemical treatments, and compounds.
Mankind will stand at the dawn of a new era; one in which
scientists, through genomics, can literally ``bring good things to
life.''
</P>
<P>
   What will this mean for you and me in our everyday lives? In the
near future, we will go down to a medical facility (the Veterans
Administration Hospital system will probably be reborn as a kind of
Division of Motor Vehicles for genotyping) and have our blood
taken. The samples will be run through a sequencing machine that
will decode every ``strength'' and every ``defect'' in our genetic
make-up. These data will then be encrypted onto a genetic
identification card, which will fit in our wallets. These data will
determine, at least to some degree, our futures.
</P>
<P>
   It is in our interest and the public interest to have this done
because it is better to know than not to know. We need to know if
our children have a genetic predisposition to heart disease,
alcoholism, or asthma. We need to know what our life expectancy
might be. We need to know if stroke might cut short our own or
someone else's career.
</P>
<P>
   But the knowledge will not and cannot be kept private. Others
will know. Insurance companies will know. Health care providers
will know. Educational institutions, governments, and law
enforcement officials will have access to the data. And decisions
about each and everyone of us will be made accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Life insurance companies that know someone is likely to suffer
from high blood pressure will be disinclined to underwrite his or
her health and life insurance policies. Mortgage lenders who know
that someone is in a ``high risk'' category for stroke will be less
inclined to grant that person a 30-year mortgage. Law enforcement
officers who know someone is in a high risk category for
unacceptable behavior will monitor that person closely.
</P>
<P>
   As knowledge based on genomics research expands, judgments about
specific individuals and groups of people will become increasingly
specific. That will raise the issue of privacy to a whole new level
of political concern. Genomics today is transforming the world of
science. In the near future, it will transform our politics as
well.

SPIRIT TO REBUILD SURVIVES IN TOWN RAVAGED BY TWISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MULHALL, Okla. _ The elementary school is destroyed. So are the
only store and the water tower.
</P>
<P>
   Among the only assets not touched by the tornado that hit here
Monday are the plucky community spirit and the plaque naming
Mulhall a finalist for the title of Best Small Town in America.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque hung Wednesday in the community center above cold
cuts and other donated relief. The spirit was evident in the
streets as residents and neighbors picked up the debris left by the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   No one died in Mulhall in the category F-4 tornado that left a
swath of death in nearby communities. But no house in this town,
which sits nestled among emerald pastures about 40 miles north of
Oklahoma City, escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 110 homes, all but 10 were left uninhabitable or suffered
major damage, according to the volunteer fire department.
</P>
<P>
   About half the of Mulhall-Orlando Elementary School appeared a
heap of plastic chairs and cinderblocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 60,000-gallon tank that held the water supply lay twisted on
the hillside, after having dumped its contents onto a nearby lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Most of town's population of about 200 is retired. The community
dates back to an 1889 land grab and was named for a promoter of
wild-west shows.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not likely anytime soon to become a dusty ghost town.
Many of its residents said Wednesday they found hope and reasons to
rebuild from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Pangburn said he hoped the catastrophe would dispel
some of the apathy that has left one of the city council's three
posts vacant. He also said the disaster might help the town obtain
long-anticipated state funding necessary to upgrade an antiquated
water-supply system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may help push (the project) along a little bit faster,''
said Pangburn, who appeared unshaven and carried two cans of spray
paint, as he prepared to go door to door, making sure all local
water valves were off.
</P>
<P>
   Up the hill, the Rev. Troy Withey worked with parishioners to
haul out the chunks of sheetrock and tufts of yellow insulation
left behind when the storm snatched pieces of the First Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Mulhall's newest inhabitants, Withey and his wife, finished
moving into the parsonage at about 2 p.m. on Monday. The twister
leveled the house about eight hours later. But it didn't take much
longer for Withey to find the silver lining in the dark stormy sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to minister in this town ... It would be hard to do if
I hadn't lost anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chainsaws buzzed on almost every street. Nearby towns sent
municipal work crews to help clear away the torn trees and smashed
homes. Private contractors came on their own, as did college
students and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pangburn, the town's contingency fund only holds
about $80,000, set aside to match state grants. To supplement the
hamlet's sparse budget, a relief fund for donations has been opened
at the Oklahoma State Bank in nearby Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, crisp American flags snapped in the breeze along the
muddy Main Street, where someone had placed them, as if for a
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only sign of business-as-usual was a fresh copy of
the Daily Oklahoman in a muddied newspaper-vending machine outside
the town's only grocery and deli.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Jackie's Farmers Store, a slab of cheese and melted bars
of butter, squashed by the winds, clung to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on soggy snacks and sheetrock, Jackie Pfeiffer talked
about rebuilding. She has considered calling it quits, she said,
during her quiet moments at home alone, in the nearby town of
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The thought, however, evaporates when she returns to the town
that she has served seven days a week for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pfeiffer: ``You know you have to come back after seeing the
rallying of the community.''

INSTALLING CEILING BUTTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The plaster ceiling in my condo in a 1920 building is
sagging. I bought some ceiling buttons to try to get the ceiling
plaster back up. But I am not sure how to use them. Are they driven
into the lath, the strapping or the joists?
</P>
<P>
   DONALD TURKEWICH, Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can drive screws into the lath which, chances are, is not
sagging. If it is, you have to drive the screws through the lath
and into the strapping, which is nailed at right angles to the
joists.
</P>
<P>
   Before driving the screws, press the plaster ceiling up and
level. Plaster applied to wood lath is pressed between the lath
strips, spreading out a little when it goes through those gaps,
creating a key; that is how the plaster is held in place. Sometimes
these ``keys'' break off and the ceiling sags.
</P>
<P>
   If the ceiling does not push up nice and evenly, it means that
broken plaster has gotten between the ceiling and the lath, and a
fix is impossible; if that happens, that section of plaster must be
removed and new plaster _ or a plasterboard patch _ put in its
place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wood paneling is 35 years old and I thought it needs a
little refurbishing. I sprayed on Old English wood polish. That
stuff smelled to high heaven, a sickening smell. I washed it with
baking soda and water; the odor remained just as strong, and
remained so even after I used Spic and Span and water, then ammonia
and water, then vinegar and water. The wood is now bone dry, with
the odor as intense as ever, and I am desperate. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR DONISI, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems to me that all those treatments did remove the
polish, so it is a mystery as to why the odor remains. There are a
couple of things you can try. 1. Wash with straight white vinegar;
your diluted vinegar wasn't strong enough. 2. Wash with paint
thinner, which has its own smell which should dissipate. 3. Wash
with Natural Magic Odor Blaster, sold in retail, hardware, and
grocery stores, or call 800-376-2442 for locations.
</P>
<P>
   Odor Blaster does not disguise the odor or paralyze the smeller,
but oxidizes the odor. It comes in scents (citrus and herbal) but I
suggest you use the ``natural'' stuff. Goodness knows you don't
need another odor.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, I suggest you sand the paneling very
lightly to roughen it, and apply two coats of a semigloss,
oil-based polyurethane varnish, which should cover the polish odor,
and with plenty of ventilation, eventually will not smell. And lay
off the polish; it does not belong on paneling anyway, in my
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am getting a distinct smell of cigarette smoke in the
living room of my apartment since a smoker moved in below me, and
it migrates to the bedroom as well. I have been in the 25-story
building since it opened in 1963. The maintenance people caulked
along the baseboard, and I think around a pipe coming out of the
floor, which helped a little. The baseboard heater is several
inches above the floor. Is there anything else that I can do?
</P>
<P>
   J. W., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Physical blocking is the best thing you can do to keep out
the smoke, and caulking is physical blocking. Have any and all
joints caulked; it may not look so hot but it may help. The joints
that can be caulked are at the top of the baseboard (which I assume
is what was already caulked), between the baseboard and the floor,
around pipes coming through the floor or wall, and possibly around
window casings because the smoke may be coming up through the wall
and into your unit around the window casing. Do this on inside
walls as well as outside ones.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a shoe mold (a quarter-round molding) between the
baseboard and floor. If you have hardwood flooring, there may be a
half-inch open joint under that shoe mold; that is an expansion
joint to allow the wood floor to expand and contract, which is good
because it prevents the floor from warping. But that open joint may
be a perfect conduit for the smoke from below. The best way to
caulk that joint is to remove the shoe mold, caulk the joint
heavily, fill the open joint, and put the shoe mold back on. This
will make a good closure, and be invisible. The caulking is
flexible enough that it will not interfere with the expansion and
contraction.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to try is to have your neighbor have his unit
caulked between wall and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Caulking has to be complete and thorough; a lick and a promise
will not do. The more seams and joints and cracks you caulk, the
better off you will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am replacing a picket fence. What kind of wood should be
used for posts, rails, and pickets? A carpenter said he would make
the pickets and build the fence for a lot less than a professional
fence company. Should the posts be set in gravel or concrete? I
would like to paint or stain the fence.
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET O'CONNELL, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ideally, the posts would be pressure-treated lumber, and the
rails and pickets would be white cedar, so you could stain them.
Stain everything with two coats of a solid latex stain. Forget
about paint. You will get no cedar bleed (brown stains bleeding
through the paint) because cedar bleed results from painting or
staining red cedar, and since white cedar has no pigment, no cedar
bleed.
</P>
<P>
   Posts should never be set in concrete. It causes premature
decay, and always put them in earth, with about 6 inches of crushed
stone at the bottom for drainage.
</P>
<P>

PICTURING MOM AS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Carol Green's images of the mother she never knew are
haunting. The walls of Le Gamin, a small South End cafe are lined
with more than 70 of Green's photographs, all of them reproductions
of the same portrait of the same delicate face, re-cast again and
again in dozens of glamorous roles.
</P>
<P>
   With these images Green, a Back Bay artist, has invented another
life for her mother, a life that might have been if she hadn't died
at 23, if she'd gone to Hollywood. When Green was growing up in
Jacksonville, Fla., friends and relatives remarked on her late
mother's beauty. ``She was pretty enough to be a movie star, that's
what people always said about her,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green's mother Sylvia died in 1937, 10 days after giving birth
to her only child. When Green was 6 years old, a cousin told her
that her stepmother was not her biological mother. At that point,
she recalled, she was more shocked to find she had a stepmother
than she was to learn her mother had died. Reared on fairy tales,
she thought all stepmothers must be evil, but her own was a
wonderful, loving woman.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 18 her father gave Green her mother's girlhood
scrapbook, which included a hand-colored photograph, an engagement
portrait which, years later, would inspire what she calls her
``Mother Made For Technicolor'' project. In 1989 Green's children,
Robin and Scott, gave her a Polaroid Spectra System camera. Not
long after, she decided to try photographing her mother's
engagement portrait. ``When that first print popped out of the
camera, there was something about it, the light on her face, that
made me think of a beautiful evocation of a '30s film star.''
</P>
<P>
   Green went on to create more than 300 images of her mother as
the star of dozens of movies, shooting the engagement portrait in
various lights, using props and fabrics to create different effects
evocative of films of the '20s and '30s. In one, ``Natasha,'' she
stares cooly from beneath a furry hat, reminsicent of Garbo in
``Ninotchka.'' In another, ``Honeymoon in Honolulu,'' she's draped
in glittery Christmas decorations, peering from behind tropical
foliage _ a fresh pineapple. In ``Mail-Order Bride'' she wears a
perky orange feathered hat. ``I used to see so many Western movies,
and there was always a mail-order bride getting off the
stagecoach,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, Green also wrote a short biography of
her mother's life as a film star. ``I wanted people to really feel
the two possibilities, that if destiny had taken a different turn
she might have been a movie star,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The biography begins with her selling hats in a department store
where she's ``discovered'' by a Hollywood talent scout, moves to
her screen test, then on to her fabulous fictional career in
movies, her roles in ``Dollface,'' ``The Follies Girl,''
``Tradewinds,'' ``Hometown Girl,'' and many more.
</P>
<P>
   People see all sorts of things in ``Mother Made For
Technocolor,'' Green says. A comment on the evanescent nature of
celebrity. A cinematic blurring of fantasy and reality. A tribute
to her lost mother. A testament to the emotional power exerted by a
lost or missing parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me all the time, was it cathartic? It wasn't at
all,'' Green said. ``It was exciting and interesting, a very
physical labor of love. But I was so caught up in the creation of
it that I felt detached from emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotion caught up with her as she was compiling collages of real
snapshots from her mother's scrapbook, black and white images to
hang alongside ``Mother Made For Technicolor.'' The girl who became
her mother frolicks on the beach with friends, poses with her new
husband on her wedding day. ``That's when I felt some deep sense of
melancholy and loss and mourning,'' Green said. ``Looking at her
real life.''

TAKE A BYTE OUT OF CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer theft is the crime that keeps on going.
</P>
<P>
   First there is the financial loss: when somebody steals your
computer, the cost of replacing the machine can easily run into
thousands of dollars. It can take even longer to replace your data
and reinstall all of your applications _ provided that you have
backups. Then there is the opportunity cost: if you use your
computer every day , you can't work until the machine is replaced.
Finally, there is the possibility for data crime: if somebody has
the audacity to steal your computer, what will they do with the
data that they find on your hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   Laptops are certainly the easiest kinds of computers to steal:
they are small, portable, easily concealed, and easily resold. But
desktop computers are commonly stolen as well. I once wrote an
article about a company in San Francisco that had its entire
network of workstations and file servers stolen over a weekend. The
thieves had come over an inside wall that separated the office from
a hallway; apparently, the partition had only gone up as far as the
false ceiling. Data wise, the company was wiped out: besides
stealing the computers, the thieves also took the company's only
tape drive.
</P>
<P>
   I'm continually surprised by the large number of homes I see
leaving themselves open to this kind of data loss. There are many
houses that have laptop or desktop computers easily visible through
first-floor windows. A simple ounce of prevention is to arrange
your home office so that valuables are not visible from the street.
</P>
<P>
   To further protect your computers, you might consider tagging
them, bolting them down, or equipping them with a tracking program.
Computer tags are my favorite physical security deterrent. The best
are made by Security Tracking of Office Property
(http://www.stoptheft.com). These tags are 2-inch square metal
plates that you can stick to a plastic or metal-cased computer.
Each plate has a serial number and requires more than 800 pounds of
force to remove. If somebody does pry off the plate, an indelible
tattoo is left underneath which proclaims that the computer is
``stolen property.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is illegal to knowingly purchase stolen property, these
tags dramatically cut the resale value of a stolen computer _ and
thus provide a disincentive to theft. Single plates cost $25 each
and include three years of the company's tracing service. It's a
great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Computer recovery isn't enough for most institutions: schools,
libraries and other organizations that do business with the public
have long used security plates to keep their computers locked down.
These plates consist of two metal pieces that lock together. The
bottom piece bolts to a table. The top piece attaches to the bottom
of the computer using a high-strength adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $50 to $250. If you put a computer in a public
place, be sure to lock the computer's case as well: a common trick
on college campuses is to steal the memory chips out of desktop
computers. The chips are worth more than their weight in gold, and
are easily resold because they have no serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   CompuTrace is a tracking system that's used by some businesses
and schools to locate stolen computers. The system is based on a
``stealth program'' that hides on your computer's hard disk and
periodically calls the company's tracing phone number when your
computer is otherwise idle. Normally, the program simply calls up,
says ``hello,'' and hangs up. But if you report a
CompuTrace-protected computer as stolen, CompuTrace will record the
phone number from which the next call is made. CompuTrace will then
work with law enforcement authorities to obtain a search warrant
for the location and return the stolen property to you.
</P>
<P>
   I have no personal experience with CompuTrace, but Vanstar, the
Canadian Mounties, and the First Tennessee Bank have used the
system successfully, according to information on the company's Web
site. The program costs $70, which includes one year of monitoring.
You can find more information about CompuTrace at
http://www.computrace.com/.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you choose to protect your computer, you should
also be sure that you back up its contents regularly. You should
make and keep several backups, and you should keep them in a
variety of places.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of backups: full backups, which back up your
computer in its entirety, and partial or incremental backups, which
just back up the data that has changed on your system. You can back
up a computer to a tape drive, a write-once CD-ROM, or to another
hard disk. I frequently back up laptop computers to the 18GB hard
drive on my server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Windows comes with its own built-in backup software.
While Microsoft Backup is good enough for saving copies of your
data, I don't like to use it for making full system backups. The
reason is disaster recovery: using Microsoft Backup, it is very
difficult to restore a crashed computer to its pre-crash condition.
</P>
<P>
   A better product is Seagate Backup Exec, which costs $60 for
Windows 98 and $95 for Windows NT. Besides making a backup of your
hard drive, Backup Exec makes a ``disaster recovery disk.'' To
restore your backup, just boot the disk and put your backup tape or
CD-ROM into the drive. Although this disaster recovery feature is
present in most other backup programs as well, I found Seagate's to
be among the easiest to use. (Indeed, it's a slimmed-down version
of Backup Exec that Microsoft ships with Windows as Microsoft
Backup.) Seagate's software also works with a wide range of tape
drives, CDR drives, and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   On the Macintosh, the clear choice for backup software is
Dantz's Retrospect. This program comes bundled with most tape
drives sold for the Macintosh. You can also buy additional packages
of Retrospect to let you back up Mac clients or even PCs on your
network. Indeed, if I had a network of PCs to back up, I would
probably buy a Mac to be my backup server and use it to run
Retrospect.

DON'T JUST GIVE MOM ANY OLD GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO MANCUSCO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Listen up, all you whiney, milky,
shopping-averse types still dithering over what to get dear old
Mom, who these days may seem younger than you.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing _ allow yourself to be sucked into the slick,
brilliantly colored Mother's Day world painted by major retailers
and you'll never locate your mom, who climbs rocks or day-trades or
predicts treacherous plot turns on soap operas _ perhaps all three
in the same day.
</P>
<P>
   No, in Retail Mother's Day Land, moms are awash in 47 flavors of
perfume, pearl jewelry, crystal vases, French terry robes, diaper
bags disguised as totes, candles and really ugly sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've already shrugged your shoulders and carried one of
those pre-wrapped gifts to the cash-wrap, setting it down like an
unfamiliar totem you hope will appease a vaguely understood deity.
This is for those of you whose minds cannot make the leap from
saute pan to serving platter, from blazer to scarf, from camera to
photo album:
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is observe what your mother already has and
then improve on it, with a replacement that's better, prettier,
more fun, nicer-smelling, cleverer or just plain newer.
</P>
<P>
   Take the camera illustration. Your mother has a camera. Is it
old, the lens scratched or just not very sharp? Or does Mom
complain that it's too tricky to use, does she have trouble loading
the film? New camera! Or consider the photo album. Are those
``peel-back'' albums from the '70s turning icky? Are overflow
snapshots jumbled in a shoe box? New photo-storage system!
</P>
<P>
   Here is a truly crucial caveat: Don't ``retire'' something with
significant sentimental attachment. Spiffy new recipe cards in a
file might seem thoughtful, but not if Mom treasures cooking from
decades-old, handwritten recipes given her by friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Look around Mom's abode or play back conversations in your mind:
It could be as simple as a pair of worn slippers that have given
their all. And don't think you must give a single ``significant''
present that costs exactly what you want to spend; opening several
packages is fun at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Mom has a sweet tooth? Treat her to what she wouldn't buy for
herself _ an assortment of Bernard C. chocolates, perhaps, or
something unexpected and nostalgic, like a box of Aplets &AMP; Cotlets.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's a fix-it whiz? What about upgrading some of those tools
she's accumulated? Is she on the cusp of CD-readiness? Maybe a
player _ and CDs of some of her favorite cassette tapes to make the
transition easier.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics and small appliances are excellent prospects but, as
with all gift ideas, you've to gauge _ by insidious interrogation,
if necessary _ whether your gift actually will be welcome. A
designer-hued six-slice toaster might be ultracool, but if Mom has
no call to produce stacks of toast rising like CD towers, your
choice will seem about as personal as, say, a glitzy new answering
machine when Mom has been raving about how much the one she has
helps out on business trips.
</P>
<P>
   The other caveat is to focus on what you and Mom share and stick
with what you know: Give Mom an uninformed gift like bicycle
gloves, a classical flute recording, home-finance software or a
mounted moth and you've presented her with a dilemma instead of
something she can enjoy. But if you have started wine-tasting
together, a set of classic goblets and a bottle of red you both
liked would fall in the ``thoughtful'' category.
</P>
<P>
   And, squirm all you want, therein lies the true secret of
gift-giving: You have to pay attention to the other person.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplate the implications _ there will be a test one week
before Father's Day.

IT'S ALL IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think about technology in the home, and your mind instantly
focuses on Internet access. Or wide-screen TVs. Or even wireless
phones possibly replacing your old, wired phone.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of PC and Mac users, the best technology in
their homes is anything that will allow them to drive faster, shoot
better, or
</P>
<P>
   hit a golf ball or baseball farther _ all on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   They're the Serious Gamers, and when it comes to their favorite
hobby, they spend Serious Money.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when you can get a decent home computer for $500, some
Serious Gamers spend that much just on a set of computer speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent $6.3 billion on computer games last year, nearly
as much as we spent on movies. For most of us, the games provide a
convenient fantasy break in the midst of a busy day. Half an hour
of blowing up aliens, and then back to work. But then there's a
hard core of fanatical gamers who devote every free moment to the
latest digital diversions. And for these fervent players, only the
finest equipment will do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first item on the serious gamer's shopping list is a
top-notch 3D graphics accelerator. Despite the sexy name, an
accelerator isn't much to look at _ just a drab-looking circuit
board covered with chips.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't ordinary chips. A 3D accelerator is actually a
computer in its own right, one that's faster in some ways than the
fastest Pentium III or Power PC chips. And all that power is used
for just one thing _ drawing realistic three-dimensional images on
your computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to a really, really good 3D gaming system is a 3D
accelerator card,'' says Dan Amrich, associate editor of
Gamepro.com, a leading computer games Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest modern games can make your computer screen appear to
be a window into a fully realized three-dimensional world. This is
achieved by constructing all the game's images out of millions of
little triangles, or polygons. When a character in the game moves,
all those millions of polygons change their angles. As a result,
every object in the game shifts its relative position, just as
you'd see while walking through a room in real life.
</P>
<P>
   But to do this in a computer requires a monstrous amount of
mathematics. Worse yet, for the game to be realistic, the images
must change smoothly and without any delay. In other words, all
that math has to happen literally in millionths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what 3D accelerators do. Top-line products, like the
3Dfx Corp.'s Voodoo 3 chip, can perform 100 billion calculations in
a second. Accelerators, like standard computer chips, also need
memory to store the data they process. Today's high-end cards
generally come with at least 16 megabytes of memory devoted solely
to 3D processing. Cards like these range from $150 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some gamers are upgrading their entire computers to get better
graphics performance. That's because of a new system for connecting
the accelerator to the computer's motherboard. It's called the
advanced graphics port, or AGP. A computer with AGP transmits data
to the accelerator much faster than with older technology.
</P>
<P>
   Just as gamers want 3D images, they're also demanding 3D sound.
In some newer games, like the shoot-'em-up Unreal, sound becomes a
vital part of the playing experience. Players who can hear the
enemy coming up behind them have a big advantage over those who
rely on the cheap speakers that came with their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   So Newton-based Cambridge SoundWorks is helping gamers fight
back, with a line of four-channel speakers especially for computer
buffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really taken a strong position that the future in
high-end audio for gaming is four-channel sound,'' says Tom
Hannaher, Cambridge SoundWorks' senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to work with four-channel computer sound
cards made by the company's Singapore-based parent, Creative
Technology Inc. Four small ``satellite speakers'' are positioned
around the room, with a subwoofer to provide powerful low-frequency
sounds, like things going ``boom!''
</P>
<P>
   The setup sells for $199, not counting the sound card. ``It's
about as much as a computer person's willing to spend on
speakers,'' Hannaher says.
</P>
<P>
   Guess again, Tom. Some fervent computer audiophiles will spend a
lot more. Eminent Technologies Inc. of Tallahassee, Fla., offers
its LFT-11 speakers, listed by Computer Gaming World magazine as
essential pieces of hardware for ultimate gaming fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   And at $500 for a pair _ $600 with auxiliary amplifier _ these
speakers are definitely priced with the fanatic in mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, for sheer gaming frenzy, it's hard to beat the thousands
worldwide who log onto the Internet to compete in auto racing
tournaments. Today's high-end car racing games allow players to
challenge each other on the world's greatest courses.
</P>
<P>
   Graphically, these games are accurate to the smallest detail.
But most players use game controllers that don't measure up. Many
use mock steering wheels and pedals that plug into a computer's
game port and boost the illusion of driving. But most of these
devices are cheaply made, with an unrealistic feel to them. After
all, building a racing wheel that would really emulate the
experience of driving a race car would cost a small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many who are happy to pay. Business is good at
Extreme Competition Controls Inc. in Minneapolis. ECCI charges up
to $1,400 for its ultra-realistic racing wheels and pedals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an automotive-quality product,'' says company president
Andy Cers. An ECCI wheel-and-pedal set is made of steel and
aluminum and weighs 50 pounds. The steering wheel offers
progressive resistance that stiffens the farther you turn it. The
braking effect varies depending on how quickly you step on the
pedal. You can even get a version that comes with a hand-made
steering wheel produced by the Italian firm Momo, renowned for
making wheels for real race cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Grandy of Scotia, N.Y., repairs cable television set-top
boxes by day and drives the on-line NASCAR stock car circuit by
night. He'd never touched a computer until four years ago. Today,
he's one of the top on-line racers, and he swears by his ECCI
steering rig. ``It's just perfect,'' Grandy says. ``I don't even
know how to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would know exactly how to describe it _ wildly
extravagant. But for the die-hard gamer, it's worth every dime.

MOTHERS DESERVE HELP, NOT BLAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a private Mother's Day communication. Unless you are a
mother or have had a mother, please go on to some other part of the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're alone now. I can talk without having to worry.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I'm brooding about:
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Littleton, parents are once again in the
gunsights. When kids go wrong, everyone's taking aim at mothers and
dads, asking, ``Shouldn't they have known? Shouldn't they have done
something? Shouldn't they have cared more?'' Not a word about the
ways we're undermined, unsupported, and burdened with the full
responsibility, not only for raising kind-hearted, stable children,
but for fighting the powerful forces in this culture that blow our
good intentions to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to be blamed for how our kids turn out, I think
it's time the culture gave us a little help.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of all the stuff parents, (let's face it, mostly
moms), are expected to do these days. In addition to holding down a
job and taking care of a home, we're supposed to be supervising
homework, attending every sporting event in which our kids
participate, taking them to doctor and dentist appointments,
keeping them clean, preparing healthy meals, overseeing
friendships, buying birthday presents, chauffeuring them to
lessons, parties, and after-school dates, purchasing and tending to
their clothing, reading to them, listening to them, stimulating
their minds, meeting with their teachers, explaining sex to them,
making sure we know where they are every moment, on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than enough to fill a mother's day.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't mind this list. It's filled with nurturing
behavior, the kind that can be accompanied by a hug or a laugh, the
kind that makes you feel you're contributing to your kids' quality
of life. No mother minds spending time having a positive effect on
her children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, there's a whole new range of expected
maternal behavior that's more like voodoo. Using our special brand
of magic, mothers are expected to ward off a clutch of dangers.
</P>
<P>
   If our kids are little, we're expected to keep informed about
pesticide residues in baby food, poisonous polyvinyl chloride in
plastic toys, and how watching TV is stunting the development of
our children's brains and attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that no one else in this culture assumes any
responsibility for your child's health and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   When they're preteens, we're supposed to combat the
corporate-sponsored fads that saturate their world, keep them from
playing video games six hours a day, warn them about the dangers of
talking to strangers and roaming the Internet. We've got to keep
the girls from admiring the stick-skinny models in fashion
magazines and the boys from imitating the bullies wrestling on
Saturday night TV, stop them all from eating fast foods, watching
violent or sex-drenched movies, and getting involved with members
of the opposite sex before they're ready. Notice that almost every
force outside the house is working against us.
</P>
<P>
   By the time our kids are teenagers, we're supposed to have
imbued them with ethical and moral principles that are ridiculed on
every TV show they watch. We're supposed to have taught them to use
alcohol wisely although the media glamorizes excess and doesn't
mention the cost in ruined lives. We're supposed to evaluate our
teen's state of mind when we don't even recognize the names of
popular rock groups and can't stand to watch the violent films
Hollywood aims at adolescent males. How can we find out where our
kids go on the Internet when we're still trying to master e-mail?
How can we deny them heavily advertised, expensive toys and
clothing when they're a prerequisite for peer acceptance?
</P>
<P>
   Who's prepared to have an intelligent conversation about
sexually transmitted diseases? Has anyone figured out how to
control what a child is exposed to at friends' houses? Are you
skilled in the art of detecting drug use? Or shoplifting? Or
promiscuity? Answer this one honestly: If your kid came home with a
bag of stuff from the local hardware store and said it was for a
school project, would you recognize the ingredients for a bomb?
</P>
<P>
   Given the roles we're expected to play, we should have trained
for motherhood at the police academy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since freedom of speech was redefined to include the
freedom to sell anything, the powers-that-be spend millions of
dollars marketing and promoting unhealthy, antisocial, harmful and
dangerous foods, weapons, games, movies, products, attitudes,
images, and ideas. And against this sophisticated, carefully
targeted barrage designed to have maximum impact on children from
the crib up, there's only Good Old Mom and Pop, standing there
yelling, ``stop,'' looking ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an accident. Advertisers know that there's only one
thing between them and children's money: parents. They can get by
you by targeting the kids themselves, not only in commercials, but
in programs and movies that spin off consumer items, and by
invading the schools. They can get around you by encouraging peer
pressure, making sure every other kid has their name imprinted on
T-shirts, sneakers, sheets, and lunch boxes. Or they can go against
you directly, picturing you in the popular culture as a
know-nothing, a behind-the-times dolt, a spoilsport.
</P>
<P>
   You think I'm exaggerating? Take a look at this quote from a
Forbes magazine article: ``We have discovered that these children
can be turned into consumers as readily as anyone else . . . by age
six a child's buying habits can be fully determined for the rest of
their lives. . . . We now have the chance to invest in appropriate
programs which will lock the children into permanent targets of
manufactured goods for the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ever-growing demands of the workplace continue to
encroach upon family time, making it increasingly difficult for
parents to be the dominant force in building the character of their
children. Is it too much to ask that this country be less willing
to reduce our children's lives to the level of consumer, no matter
what the cost to their souls?
</P>
<P>
   This is the Mother's Day card I'm sending you.
</P>
<P>
   For Mom, who is doing the best she can against all odds.

   To you, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Cheating is one of society's most universally accepted no-nos,
but we tend to make two mistakes in our efforts to convey its
seriousness to children: We overreact to young kids who cheat and
underreact to older ones.
</P>
<P>
   We're quick to jump on a preschooler who cheats and assume it's
purposeful. In fact, it's not fair even to call it cheating, says
clinical psychologist Lawrence Kutner. ``At this age, there's no
malice, no sense of wrongdoing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a grade-school child who cheats on a test or at sports,
we tend to issue a stern reprimand _ ``Cheating is wrong; don't let
me catch you at it again'' _ and let it go. We should be doing
more, says child psychiatrist Eugene Beresin. At this age, cheating
can be a tip-off to an underlying problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the preschool years, a child is developmentally incredibly
egocentric, able to concentrate on only one thing at a time, and
not yet capable of internalizing rules. When the dice rolls four
and he moves five, he simply thinks he can put the rules aside
because they don't fit his need, at least not at the moment: ``I
want my token to be here now; I'm the center of the universe, so I
put it where I want.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA developmental psychologist Deborah Stipek says this isn't
cheating. ``It's strategic planning,'' she says, ``a kind of
convenient forgetting to fit his needs.''
</P>
<P>
   A child's magical thinking can also sometimes look like
cheating. When Kutner's son was 6, he took a fencing class. Even
though Kutner was there one day to witness his son's ``defeat,''
the boy insisted it hadn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   Beresin says that's because the line between fantasy and reality
is so thin: ``If a child imagines it happening one way, he may be
unable to see that it really didn't.'' Beresin is director of child
and residency training at McLean and Massachusetts General
Hospitals and associate professor at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a 6-year-old's insistence that he won or a
preschooler's manipulation of a board game, the flouting of rules
is rarely motivated by competitiveness. More likely, it's a need to
accomplish. When you ask her why she moved her token ahead, for
instance, she might say, ``I wanted to get to the end,'' or ``I
wanted to catch up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   When her own daughter was 4, Stipek can remember her saying,
``Mommy, why don't you go twice, too? That way, we both can win!''
Stipek recalls being delighted at her daughter's suggestion and
taking her up on the offer. Unfortunately, that's a move many of us
would resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell parents to make light of a 4-year-old's `cheating,' ''
says child psychologist and parent educator Lawrence Balter of New
York University. Use humor: ``I guess you really want to win
today!'' ``Once in a while can I win, please!?'' and definitely
don't punish, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Between 5 and 7, a child begins to move along the continuum to
understanding that breaking rules is cheating. Now Balter suggests
gentle reminders that these aren't the real rules: ``I guess we can
play with your rules this time. It also helps to provide a reality
check: ``You know, if you were playing with your friends, they
might not like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they would probably hate it.
</P>
<P>
   A school-age child who cheats with friends or siblings may do it
initially because he thinks he needs an edge to gain approval. Once
he is found out, there's such a negative reaction that he won't do
it again. The child who persists not only doesn't feel good about
himself, but actually sabotages himself.
</P>
<P>
   Beresin says, ``The more he cheats to gain the perceived edge,
the more trouble he gets in with his friends, the more self-esteem
plummets, the more desperate his measures get and the angrier the
peer sanction. Now he's in so deep he can't get out without
professional help.''
</P>
<P>
   How we respond to school-age cheating sends several messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a first-grader cuts in line, every child in class sees it
as cheating,'' says Stipek. ``If the teacher harshly tells the
cutter to go to the end of the line, she reinforces the notion for
everyone that this is an externally imposed rule you follow to
avoid punishment. But if she says, `How would you feel if you stood
in line patiently and someone cut in front of you?' she's helping
all of them understand the value of the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the approach to emulate, says Stipek, because seeing the
value and fairness of a rule is what enables a child to adopt it as
her own and not want to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, children are more likely to cheat at school when
parents consistently ask, ``How did you do on the test?'' The
message they get is that performance is what counts, not learning,
so when there's an opportunity to cheat to enhance a grade, they
see no reason not to take it. Stipek, a researcher and director of
the laboratory elementary school at UCLA, fears that the increased
emphasis on standardized tests in American schools could
inadvertently lead to more cheating among children.
</P>
<P>
   Beresin calls academic cheating a cry for help.
</P>
<P>
   Kutner agrees: ``Assume that the child who cheats on a test,
even once, does it because he sees cheating as the best solution to
a problem. Our job is to figure out what the problem is.'' Kutner
is author of ``Toddlers and Preschoolers'' and ``Your School Age
Child'' (both Morrow).
</P>
<P>
   There are several possibilities. At one end of the continuum is
a child who is a good student and can do the work but feels
unprepared this particular day. ``This won't be a chronic
cheater,'' says Beresin, but the situation deserves examination of
the pressures the child feels and ways to keep them in check.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is a child with severe, multifaceted
problems that could include an undiagnosed learning disability, an
emotional disorder, or both. In between, there's a range of
possibilities, from mild LD to a family problem. It's not unusual,
for instance, for a child whose parents are getting divorced to
cheat, hoping they will find out and be distracted enough to focus
on him instead of on the divorce. ``In his mind, it's a way to
bring them all back together,'' says Kutner.
</P>
<P>
   Most typically, the cause of cheating is some variation of being
unable to do the work. ``Cheating is a way to keep up with the
class,'' says Beresin. Some kids are so adept at it that they go
years without detection. Whenever it is discovered, a conference
with teachers and an evaluation may be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Beresin recommends consequences for academic cheating that are
direct _ rewriting a paper, writing an extra one, retaking a test _
and constructive: helping a child organize himself better to study
for a test or to do homework, perhaps educational testing or a
tutor. Whatever it is, says Beresin, the message needs to be clear:
We value learning for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   Stipek warns against overly harsh consequences _ ``A month of no
phone doesn't make much sense, but maybe no calls until homework is
done'' _ and against imposing consequences without exploring what's
behind the cheating. Kutner poses a series of questions parents can
ask:
</P>
<P>
   --Is she struggling to do the work?
</P>
<P>
   --Is this a highly competitive class/school/family?
</P>
<P>
   --What pressures is she feeling?
</P>
<P>
   --What's going on in the family/community?
</P>
<P>
   --Has there been a change in friendship groups?
</P>
<P>
   --Is there a medical problem?
</P>
<P>
   Not to be minimized is the role our behavior serves as a model
for our children. The recently uncovered practice in some
Boston-area schools of adults' purposefully misreporting scholastic
game scores does not go unnoticed by children, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it may have been done to spare the feelings of
youngsters on a badly losing team, ``there's no two ways about it
for kids,'' says Kutner. ``They see it as cheating.''

and the idea sounds counterproductive, anecdotal reports are that
it works wonders.

<P>
   &UR; For a better bladder, drink some more water
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Common sense might seem to suggest that drinking a lot of water
would keep your bladder healthier, by diluting bad stuff and
flushing it out of your system. Now Harvard University researchers
have a study showing common sense is right.
</P>
<P>
   Men who drink at least five pints of water and other liquids
each day cut their risk of two common types of bladder cancer by 49
percent compared to men whose daily fluid intake was 40 ounces or
less, according to a study in the current New England Journal of
Medicine. Bladder cancer, which is most common in smokers, is the
fourth leading type of cancer among US men, who contract it at four
times the rate of women.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Dr. Dominique S. Michaud of the Harvard School of
Public Health studied 47,909 American men who participated over 10
years in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring out several other things that affect cancer rates _
including smoking, geography, and eating fruits and vegetables _
Michaud's team found the risk of developing cancer dropped in
direct proportion to daily fluid intake. Drinking water had the
clearest link to reducing bladder cancer, but milk, juices, coffee,
and even alcoholic beverages in daily fluid intake also helped.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have not concluded why drinking liquids helps
prevent bladder cancers. But a commonly accepted theory is that it
dilutes carcinogens in urine and encourages frequent urination,
which reduces exposure to the cancer-causing substances. The study
reiterates that the best way to reduce the risk of bladder cancer
is to quit smoking. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Sexual woes, treatment of cervical cancer linked &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Treatments for cervical cancer caused sexual problems for one in
four Swedish women, but not to the point of affecting their ability
to have an orgasm, a study in the current New England Journal
found. The authors, led by Dr. Karin Bergmark of Stockholm's
Karolinska Institute, said the study indicates physicians may need
to do a better job counseling women being treated for cervical
cancer about the possible impact on sexual function and develop
surgical techniques that reduce these problems.
</P>
<P>
   A questionnaire distributed to 256 women who had undergone
treatments, chiefly hysterectomies and removal of pelvic lymph
tissue, found about 26 percent later complained of ``moderate or
much distress'' over changes to their vagina, including loss of
elasticity, pain during sex, and inability to lubricate. This
compared to 8 percent in a control group of 350 women without
cancer. However, they found that ``the frequency of orgasms and
orgasmic pleasure was similar in the two groups.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Addition to Pap smear urged to lessen worries
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In more news relating to cervical cancer this week, a study in
the Journal of the American Medical Association found that adding a
second test to the common Pap smear can eliminate the need for
follow-up Pap smears in hundreds of thousands of women.
</P>
<P>
   Subjecting a Pap smear sample to a simultaneous second test for
the papilloma virus that causes most cervical cancer can find
virtually all cases of cancer or latent cancer, without requiring
women to wait anxiously for several weeks or months for a second
Pap smear or other test.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of women having the test will, at some time in
their lives, get an uncertain result called ASCUS, indicating they
need a follow-up test, according to study leader Michele Manos, a
Kaiser Permanente researcher. In women who got an ASCUS report from
the Pap smear, which had been subjected to the second test and did
not show the papilloma virus, researchers could be ``99 percent
certain'' the women did not have cancer, Manos said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Needle biopsies backed as surgical alternative
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other medical news: Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers
led by radiologist Dr. Jack E. Meyer reported in JAMA that
large-core needle biopsies of malignant breast tissue are a safe,
effective, and easier alternative to having tissue samples taken by
surgically opening the breast . . . Researcher Matthias A. Hediger
of the Brigham and colleagues report in the current Nature they
have found a gene that aids in absorbing vitamin C, which could
lead to treatments for diseases related to poor absorption of the
vitamin . . . Arsenic trioxide, commonly used in Chinese medicine,
showed considerable promise in lab tests in treating a variety of
lymphatic cancers by reducing cell growth, according to a study in
Wednesday's Journal of the National Cancer Institute by Shanghai
and Mount Sinai School of Medicine researchers.

PRODUCTS TO TURN YOUR COMPUTER INTO A PHOTO ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM COAKLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your neighbor Jill sent out Christmas cards containing computer
photos of her kids, and admit it, you're jealous.
</P>
<P>
   But you're also not so sure you want to completely give up the
security of holding a real live snapshot in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   An array of photo digitizing services available everywhere from
camera shops to supermarkets and drugstores is targeting an
increasing demand for computer imaging among the mainstay of the
business: customers who want their film developed and turned into
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: ``Mom'' is still the biggest user of photo
developing services, and as Brian Noble of Hingham-based Noble
Camera points out, Mom ``isn't going to trust her kid's baby album
to a computer hard drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always going to want a hard copy, something she can put
in that album,'' Noble says.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, Mom and her family are computer users who
relish the notion of getting both prints and digitized copies of
those prints that they can transfer to their computers, improving
the quality of shots, cropping them, printing them, copying them,
e-mailing them to friends and family, and, like Jill, dropping them
into greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   More computer-savvy customers _ those who own their own scanners
and digital cameras _ can input photos directly into their PCs. But
it's the average picture taker who is creating a huge demand for
digitizing services. As more and more services become available,
more people try them and get hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that the next wave of amateur photographers
is poised to enter the digital arena, and in a big way,'' says Paul
Gordon, vice president of marketing and corporate communications
for Konica Photo Imaging. ``Consumers understand electronic media,
are comfortable with it, and want in on the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble says 3 to 5 percent of his customers now ask about
digitizing services, but ``we expect that to increase dramatically
now that computer and printer prices are dropping,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   And Eastman Kodak reports that customers asked for its new
Picture CD product with 4 to 6 percent of the rolls processed in
test marketing conducted in Salt Lake City and Indianapolis. Most
of the customers asking for the new service did not have scanners
or digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floppies and CDs
</P>
<P>
   These days, customers can put their photos on floppy disks,
compact discs, and in special files on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to buy special software to view or manipulate
your photos; the floppies and compact discs contain software that
allows you to view, change, copy, and print photos. The Kodak
Picture CD, with a larger capacity than a floppy, allows it to
carry even more options, such as adjusting brightness and contrast.
(Most of this software is designed for use on PCs, although some,
such as Konica's Picture Show and the Kodak Picture CD, also offer
Macintosh software. But even with those products that do not have
Macintosh options, the digitized photos can be brought up on the
computer screen with any program that can read images in the JPEG
format, such as Picture Viewer, which is part of the Macintosh
operating system.)
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers also have kiosks where prints can be digitized
through a scanner and then enlarged or otherwise modified. Or you
can have photos that are already on a floppy or CD enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   However, there also is software you can buy at your local
computer store that lets you do a lot more with your digitized
photos: programs such as Adobe Photo Deluxe ($50) and Microsoft
Publisher ($70).
</P>
<P>
   Photo Deluxe is a scaled-down version of Adobe's expensive Photo
Shop program. In addition to the basic photo fix offerings, it
allows you to resize photos by dimension (5 by 7 inches, 8 by 10
inches, etc.) and by file size (bytes to megbytes), to balance
colors (more yellow, less blue, more red) and to prepare image
files for upload to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Publisher is a basic desktop publishing program that
allows you to drop photos into text, such as many other word
processing programs, but also provides greeting card and other
templates and a fairly extensive clip-art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for retail-level digital services vary, and often are in
addition to costs for developing and printing. Putting a roll of
film on a floppy runs about $5 or $6, and getting images on a CD
will cost about $10 or $12 for regular consumer versions and much
more for professional quality. In-store enlargements cost about $7
per print.
</P>
<P>
   Film is often shipped out to labs and the disks/discs are
returned in two days to a week. But a trend in the industry is to
install sophisticated equipment to develop and print film and turn
images into digital files on site in less than a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision right now is we wanted people not to have to pay a
penalty in time to get their image digitized,'' says Rory Gumina,
Kodak's director of marketing for digitization products. ``Whenever
you want your pictures, you should be able to get your digitized
images as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble's Hingham store has equipment that can put photos on
floppies or compact discs the same day you bring in the film.
</P>
<P>
   And Cameras Inc. in Arlington, Lexington, and Stoneham has
ordered similar equipment from Fuji Photo Film USA. If the company
decides to install the machine, it, too, will offer same-day
service on digitized products, says Rick Gaskell, who runs photo
labs for the company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet photos
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to store your digitized photos not on a disk
or disc, but on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You simply check the Internet box on your photo order when you
bring in your film. It costs $5 or $6.
</P>
<P>
   Along with your negatives or prints, the film processor will
return a card containing the Internet address you use to get to the
online photo service (such as www.konica.com or
www.kodak.photonet.com) and an access code.
</P>
<P>
   Connect to the Internet, go to the page, and use the code to
access your photos, which are stored on a page for 20 or 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The photos pop up as thumbnail images. You can choose among
several thumbnail sizes. You can also download photos (including a
higher resolution image for $1), e-mail them, or give others the
Web address so they can look at the photos on their computer.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, more consumers are buying into the digital age. Tom
Hoerrner, Fuji's marketing manager for lab systems, says Fuji will
sell more digital mini-labs this year than traditional
photo-processing equipment, even though the digital setups are 15
to 20 percent more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuji equipment, like other such mini-labs, allows even
customers with digital cameras to bring in photos on digital camera
storage cards such as Smart Media and get finished, glossy prints.
</P>
<P>
   So after you import your favorite photos into your Christmas
cards, you can also tuck them securely into that photo album.

MOVE OVER, ANALOG; DIGITAL'S THE DEAN IN CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analog cellular wireless phones are destined for the dumpster,
on their way to extinction like the black-and-white TV, pushed
aside by digital technology. It's a matter of just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   So why do statistics show that analog service is still used by
75 percent of the nation's 60 million wireless cell phone users?
Even though digital service edged out analog last year for the
first time ever in the competition for new subscribers, it still
means
</P>
<P>
   that nearly 12 million Americans who jumped into the wireless
world last year chose analog.
</P>
<P>
   Are they fools?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. Analog phones offer American consumers a low-cost
way to try out wireless phone service without the big investment
for a digital phone. Entry-level digital phones cost at least $100
or so, while the analog handset costs little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates quibble with the words ``costs nothing'' or
``free'' to describe the giveaway of analog handsets; they say you
ultimately pay for the phone through higher per-minute costs.
Nonetheless, it's clear that you cough up less money overall in the
first year by going with a basic analog plan rather than a digital
one.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're the kind of person who wants a wireless phone for
convenience, and in case of emergencies, you'll appreciate that
analog services still trump digital when it comes to blanket
coverage across the country. Analog has just been around longer,
and has more antenna sites up from coast-to-coast, especially in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   That said, digital phones have many major advantages, including
better voice quality and protection from eavesdropping. And for
people who use their wireless phones a moderate amount, about 100
minutes or so each month, digital services _ with their
increasingly popular one-rate plans _ start to become cheaper than
analog, even if you factor in the cost of the phone. Digital
one-rate plans can cost as little as a dime a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Digital is simply a superior and more efficient technology.
Analog has the drawback of having to transmit a person's entire
voice over a radio channel. Even if there's silence on both ends of
the phone, that radio channel is still tied up. There are a limited
number of channels, and if you've ever tried to call your spouse as
you're driving home in a blizzard and can't get through, it's
because virtually everyone else on the road with you is also trying
to call home on their analog phones.
</P>
<P>
   And if the call is intercepted somehow, you better believe the
stranger listening in can understand every word. Just ask former US
House speaker Newt Gingrich, whose cell phone conversation about
his ethics problems was later broadcast to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Digital technology, on the other hand, converts the phone
conversation into a stream of binary 1's and 0's, which enables the
calls to be greatly compressed and several calls to travel along
the same radio channel. So per-minute charges are generally
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And because a caller's voice is turned into digital codes while
traveling along the radio waves, it's impossible to eavesdrop on
the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of analog's imminent demise are not exaggerated. And
wireless phone executives aren't looking back. Their heavily
promoted cutting-edge products all depend on digital services,
including smart-phone devices with Internet access, as well as
novel ways of sending and receiving e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For business users, companies are also on the brink of rolling
out ways in which you can use your wireless phone for high-speed
data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   These executives are ecstatic about the idea that a digital
phone could provide everyday access to the Internet or allow one to
send lengthy memos.
</P>
<P>
   They can just see the cell-phone meter running and the dimes
dropping in.
</P>
<P>
   Analog will probably just fade away through attrition, as
digital plans start to be more competitive on price and carriers
refuse to sign on new analog customers.
</P>
<P>
   As of this summer, AT&AMP;T Wireless will no longer offer analog
service to new subscribers in New York and some other cities where
such service has been available, according to David Stanley-Brown,
national director of advanced services for AT&AMP;T Wireless. (AT&AMP;T
Wireless in Boston has always been digital.)
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say, however, that analog service, not the phones
themselves, may have some staying power. They argue that carriers
will be loathe to spend money to build extensive digital networks
in small, rural areas where analog now operates. Digital phones,
they say, will continue to have the option of roaming onto analog
in areas where digital doesn't have service yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carriers can't get rid of analog now,'' says Kent Olson,
director of the Strategis Group, a telecommunications consulting
group in Washington. ``That's where the coverage is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what the next generation of digital phones will
look like. Carriers like to say future phones will be smaller and
slimmer, yet they also talk about including bigger text screens for
Internet display as well as keyboards for users to type messages.
Just how will they fit a keyboard that doesn't require doll-like
fingers? Technology specialists say they're working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lynch, executive vice president and chief technology
officer for Bell Atlantic Mobile, says digital phones in the next
decade will have clever new options, such as the ability to convey
their location to other phones. That could come in handy if you're
stranded on an unknown highway and call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowenstein, senior vice president for the Yankee Group, a
Boston-based telecommunications research firm, predicts that even
some of today's digital phones may become obsolete in their own
way, especially if you want the gee-whiz new services. In this
fast-changing wireless phone world, he says, the life cycle of a
typical handset is about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe today's digital handsets will turn into
tomorrow's freebies.

INTERNET IS A NEW ROAD TO ROCK STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you want to be a rock star? Then get out of the garage and
get yourself a computer.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what some folks are doing, thanks to a
technology called MP3, an audio format that enables users with
minimal computer experience to distribute their music over the
Internet. Ginny Weaver, singer with Boston Indie band Star Ghost
Dog, is one of the believers in the new format. About six weeks
ago, she and her band posted two songs on MP3.com, the popular Web
site that features free music by more than 10,000 groups, most of
them unsigned and unknown beyond their own basements.
</P>
<P>
   To put it politely, a lot of the music offered for free on the
site proves the maxim, ``You get what you pay for.'' But that's not
the case with Star Ghost Dog. Its two songs, ``Plus de Vaches'' and
``Downer,'' are smart pop tunes with a witty, subversive edge. The
band was featured as a ``Hot New Band'' on the site, and their
songs have hit the MP3.com charts.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Weaver has any illusions that MP3 is going to
turn the band into an overnight rock sensation. Let's be realistic.
``This is not the story of the century,'' she says. ``It's not like
we're expecting a big deal. We hope to get more fans, more
attention, but we don't expect to be noticed by A&AMP;R (artist and
repertoire) scouts surfing the 'netfor new music.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver has received e-mail from all over the world since she
posted the songs. And, there's a fringe benefit: the service is
free. And it's easy. Weaver, who isn't likely to be mistaken for a
computer engineer, says it takes about 30 minutes to convert
regular CDs into the MP3 format. It's even easier to listen to the
tunes: click, download and you're in business.
</P>
<P>
   This ease of use, however, has blood pressure rising in the
offices of industry executives, who foresee massive music piracy
and fear a realignment of the entire industry. The Recording
Industry Association of America tried to block the technology, but
eventually realized that it had to get in touch with the times. As
such, the association is working on developing its own standards
for on-line distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But for bands like Star Ghost Dog, piracy is hardly a worry.
``To be honest, at our level it isn't even a concern,'' Weaver says
with a soft laugh. ``Any new exposure is good.'' She's glad her
group's songs have done well on MP3.com's charts, although it would
be easy to manipulate the record-keeping by having your friends
download your songs repeatedly. ``A lot of bands do that, but I'm
really interested in getting the real picture of what's going on. I
don't try to influence the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is changing faster than musicians can keep up with
it, and it's essential to stay on top of technological innovation.
Some day, some band is going to break through and make it big using
the Internet. ``It's inevitable,'' Weaver says. ``We're just a
small part of a huge phenomenon.''

<P>
   This just in from Mount Everest: Spam is not just unwanted
e-mail, it's a vital food substance at altitudes of 17,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what we hear from Liesl Clark, producer of
NOVA's documentary project, ``Lost on Everest.'' Clark and a PBS
NOVA crew have joined an expedition that is ascending Everest to
discover whether British climbers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine
reached the summit before disappearing in 1924. The crew is
reporting its findings daily on the NOVA Web site
(www.pbs.org/nova/everest), where armchair adventurers can follow
the search as it unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew waits for high winds to subside before beginning
the search, Clark answered a few questions via e-mail from the
mountain. (She has two laptops powered by special lithium batteries
designed for high altitude, and a satellite phone.)
</P>
<P>
   The typical day begins at 7 a.m. ``What's for breakfast?'' Clark
writes. ``I'm ashamed to say that someone on the expedition brought
a lifetime supply of Spam. Our cook serves it with every meal.''
Clark spends the rest of the day filming, filing dispatches, and
shooting digital photos for the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Her computer hasn't quite acclimated to the temperature, though.
``To get it jump-started in the morning, I have to place the
machine on its back, like a turtle, and wait until the sun peaks
over the high rock towers above us. Just three minutes of the
intense Himalayan sun is enough to warm the inner organs so the
computer can start up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark reports the good and the bad from on high. ``Good news:
Someone on our team gave our Sherpas (mountain guides) a boom box
that charges itself from a solar panel. This means we save our D
cell batteries as the Sherpas entertain themselves. Bad news: They
only brought one tape (a tinny rendition of Indian Disco music),
and we hear it, blasted full level, about 30 times a day. Disco
opens at 7:00 a.m. and goes until the wee hours.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds slightly surreal, so does the notion of
communicating via e-mail and loading images to a Web site thousands
of miles a way. ``Here, we worship the satellite phone and
computer, amazed that just one connecting cord between the two can
bring in missives from family, colleagues and strangers,'' Clark
writes. ``Unfortunately, when you're this connected, people expect
you to respond with as much ease as you would at home. But, as soon
as the sun sets, keyboard gets cold, fingers freeze up and feel
like fat sausages, toes begin to numb, the wind whips in through
the cracks of the tent, and your brain gives up early from the lack
of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues are very patient with me as surely my writing
and messages are less than coherent whenever I reach a higher
altitude: spelling goes, typos abound, short term memory wanes, and
my choice of words reverts to that of a 10 year old... Did I
mention short term memory?''
</P>
<P>
   Short-term memory or not, Clark will keep browsers informed
about the expedition, thanks to computer memory. She'll be
reporting on the Web site and sending occasional e-mails to this
column. Think warm thoughts.

 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Poet Alberto Rios grew up multilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first language was (begin ital) everything (end ital),'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   With a Mexican father and a British mother, the boy Alberto used
everything within his grasp to communicate _ words, gestures,
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Multilingualism has served him well as a writer, teaching him
that everything has more than one name. Critics have said he writes
in Spanish that looks like English: English words, Spanish syntax.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion is uniquely Rios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quirk of my upbringing and how I've come to see
things,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, a regents professor at Arizona State University who
teaches creative writing and Latin American literature, has just
published a new collection of short stories, ``The Curtain of
Trees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtain of Trees'' draws from his heritage in a family of
storytellers. Much of the Rios clan came from northern Sonora,
Mexico, and many were involved in the Mexican Revolution early in
this century.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Obregon Rios, born in Nogales, Ariz., was himself named
for Mexican revolutionary general Alvaro Obregon, who served four
years as president of Mexico before being assassinated in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Rios's characters come from those Sonoran roots. Family history
fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book wrote itself,'' he says. ``It came out of my body,
out of my brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories are rich in details of the time period, a common
thread in his literature. So authentically historic are his
stories, in fact, that some are studied in anthropology classes.
</P>
<P>
   But Rios' family was not locked only in tales of past
adventures. They also embraced contemporary culture. He recalls one
afternoon when his great aunts thrilled to a recording by crooner
Engelbert Humperdinck.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of that moment _ how do you get from the Mexican
Revolution to Engelbert Humperdinck?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is somewhere between the pages of ``Curtain of
Trees,'' which comes out this month and already has earned praise
from ``Publishers Weekly''.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, Rios will publish a memoir, ``Capirotada: A Nogales
Memoir.'' Its title refers to a Mexican bread pudding that
encompasses myriad ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a metaphor for how we try to make things better,'' he
says. ``It's a confusion. My life has been a confusion of good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The good things have been coming for some time. Rios, 46, is the
author of seven books and chapbooks of poetry, and two collections
of short stories. He has won the Arizona Governor's Award, the Walt
Whitman Award, the Western States Book Award for Fiction and five
Pushcart Prizes in poetry and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Rios' success in prose might come as a surprise to those who
consider him primarily a poet. But all his writing springs from the
same well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a poet,'' he says. ``I think of all my work as poetry. I
write prose to teach me how to be a better poet.''
</P>
<P>
   His themes also have a common focus. Rios says his 13-year-old
son, Joaquin, teases him that his next book will be about Nogales
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin is not psychic. He is a bright boy who knows his father
well. Much of Rios' work dwells on Nogales in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, he says, about ``the people who are me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my anchor. You need not look far away. You need only
look closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are admonished to write what they know, he notes, and
``that's enough for a lifetime.'' &QL;

A HOUSE THAT ANTICIPATES YOUR EVERY MOVE

<P>
   Ubiquitous computing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the watchword ``plastics'' whispered in Dustin Hoffman's
ear a generation ago, this latest catch-phrase has the tech-heads
buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   No longer just boxes on desks or laps, computers soon will be
embedded all over your house, your car _ even your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Unobtrusive, perhaps, but still ubiquitous. These computers will
have cameras or sensors for eyes, and microphones for ears. They
will link all of the appliances in your house, and connect your
house to your office computer, and to your car. And they'll get to
know you, responding to _ even anticipating _ your needs.
</P>
<P>
   In the intelligent home, you will interact with computers the
same way you interact with other people _ with speech and gesture,
and even with body language.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous computing goes far beyond user-friendly: This stuff
is downright sycophantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is not just something that makes
dinner for you or a robot that vacuums, because computers will be
more useful, and they'll get their hands on everything that we
do,'' says Michael Coen of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``From running a bath at the
right temperature, to letting you know who's in your house, or who
has borrowed one of your books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It promises a revolution in quality of life the way indoor
plumbing or the light bulb did. It rivals those in changing the way
people live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're depressed, if you come home in the middle of the day
and ask the room to shut the blinds and turn off the lights and
you're not moving, it indicates you're interested in somber
music,'' says Coen, who runs a project called The Intelligent Room,
partly funded by the Department of Defense. ``It will know you're
probably not interested in listening to swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The intelligent home will recognize its occupants and act
accordingly: Kitchen cabinets will lock automatically when toddlers
go near them. If the house detects an elderly occupant lying on the
floor, it will immediately call for an ambulance. If you watch
David Letterman's monologue every night, but are stuck at an
endless dinner party, the embedded computers will automatically
record it for you. If you like to jump in the Jacuzzi at 9 every
evening, it will be bubbling at 8:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've lost my keys, I would simply like to ask the room, and
it will have seen me put my keys down, and it can tell me where
they are,'' says Coen.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, even garbage cans might contain embedded
computers that will know what empty packages you're throwing away
and re-order products for you via a link to the supermarket. Over
time, it might learn how long it takes for you to consume certain
foods, so that an order for more is placed even before you throw
the old package away.
</P>
<P>
   In the new world, teenagers will lose big, but, hey, somebody
has to. It is already possible for a home security system to snap a
picture of latch-key kids returning from school and automatically
e-mail it to anxious parents at the office. But intelligent homes
will go further, contacting you when you're out of town to tell you
your 16-year-old has 200 of her closest friends over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, eh? But let's be realistic: How will the average
Jane, who, let's face it, can barely program her own VCR, teach an
entire house full of computers about her penchants?
</P>
<P>
   She won't have to.
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps the most remarkable thing about ubiquitous
computing: After an initial set-up by somebody who knows what she's
doing, the computers will learn for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mozer's house is getting to know him. The computer
science professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder lives in
a 90-year-old converted three-room schoolhouse on a prairie near
the campus. In the early '90s, he and his students installed five
miles of conductor wire and 75 sensors in the house.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of ``watching'' him, Mozer's house has
learned his habits. It knows when he is most likely to be at home,
what rooms he uses at different times of the day, and how much
light and heat he prefers in each. Its default setting is to use as
little energy as possible, until Mozer teaches it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It learns my habits,'' says Mozer. ``I live in the house as an
ordinary person would. If I'm cold, I turn up the thermostat. Every
time I perform one of those (manual) actions, the house punishes
itself: `I should have anticipated that,' and learns for the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people would like to think their lives are less predictable
than that. But, Mozer says, even the most exciting person has
subtle patterns on which the computer, using hundreds of examples,
can easily pick up: If one goes to bed later than usual, for
instance, one likely wakes up later than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, his preferences will be transportable. ``It
would be nice to turn up in a hotel room and have it know who I
was,'' he says. ``My house could transmit my parameters to the
hotel room, and I wouldn't have to fumble to find CNN like I always
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozer says he's gotten to like his house, and even to let it
tell him what to do sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to anthropomorphize it,'' he says. ``It knows my
preferences, it knows my schedules. Sometimes, when it indicates
it's time for me to go to bed, I'll oblige it.''
</P>
<P>
   So how long before this brave new world comes to your living
room?
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the giant house of _ who else? _ computer magnate Bill
Gates, some of this is already up and running. Visitors are asked a
few questions about their tastes, pinned with a nifty electronic
badge, then sent off to wander the house. When they enter a room,
works by the artist of their choice appear on high-resolution TV
screens, and their favorite music begins playing. And the
all-seeing, all-knowing computer follows them wherever they go.
Gates always knows where his guests are, because the pins work like
homing devices. If the visitor has a call, only the telephone
closest to him will ring.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who don't have $60 billion, Coen says this brave
new world will be here sooner than you might think. ``Probably 10
or 15 years away, but not further than that,'' he says. And, Mozer
says, new homes are being built now with IBM network wiring that,
for a couple of thousand dollars, will allow ubiquitous computing
to just slide right into them when it becomes widely available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for ubiquitous computing to show up in cars first. Some
vehicles are already equipped with navigation systems, but they're
pretty primitive compared to what's being developed by companies
like Motorola. Pretty soon, says Brian McCalley, market development
manger for driver information systems at Motorola, in Austin,
Texas, a small screen where the car radio is now will display a map
if you're lost, and help you find the closest Thai restaurant if
you're hungry. It will read your e-mail to you and help schedule
your appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get all little pockets of things, and then one day, all of
a sudden, they're all connected,'' McCalley says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the myriad possibilities for personalizing the
car itself, in the way Mozer's and Coen's work tailors homes to its
occupants. Before you get into your car, it will recognize you and
customize the seats, mirrors, steering wheels and radio to your
height, your _ ahem _ breadth, your favorite stations. Parents will
be able to program the car so that speed is limited when teenagers
drive it. McCally says the car will even be able to tell you in
great detail when something is wrong, and show you _ with video, if
necessary _ how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   McCalley says some of this technology will show up in cars as
early as 2001. Folks are usually more techno-minded about their
vehicles anyway. ``It's a status symbol to have technology in your
car,'' says Coen.
</P>
<P>
   But he says it won't be long before it spreads further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking into rooms that don't respond to your being there in
20 years will feel like walking into a log cabin,'' says Coen. ``It
will feel like going into a hut in a Third World country.''
</P>
<P>
   Or living in a world without plastic.

MEETING OVERDUE FOR VETERANS ZENGA, NICHOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ The low-ceilinged locker room at
5,600-capacity Bowditch Field was an incongruous place for Walter
Zenga and Steve Nichol to cross paths. They had played for nearly
20 years with clubs in Europe, with their national teams, but had
never met before the Revolution and Boston Bulldogs faced each
other in an exhibition Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we knew about each other, but we didn't know each
other,'' Nichol said after conversing with Revolution player-coach
Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga and Galderisi have kept high profiles since arriving in
the United States, but so far Nichol has remained virtually
anonymous. But it should be known that Nichol's accomplishments
more than rival the Italians'.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nichol not only won a European Champions Cup title with
Liverpool, he won in Rome in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' Nichol said. ``Most of the guys
I'm playing with now are a bit too young to remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nichol probably has not received the proper respect
since arriving as a player-assistant coach with the Bulldogs. About
10 minutes into his first game, he suffered an ankle injury after
clashing with a Connecticut foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I was assassinated,'' Nichol said. ``But that's
life. It was a tackle and that is part of the game. Next time you
just have to be a bit quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Nichol been able to take the time to display his
credentials, the opponents might have given him some room. He was a
part of the Liverpool dynasty, played in two European Champions Cup
finals, at the Mexico '86 World Cup with Scotland. There was glory
in the penalty-kick defeat of AS Roma in 1984, the tragedies of
Heysel Stadium '85 and Hillsborough in the 1989 FA Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Heysel disaster led to the banning of English teams
from European competitions, and made a meeting with the likes of
Galderisi and Zenga less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they all have arrived in the United States to provide
guidance to young teams desperately in need of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every player wants to coach,'' Nichol said. ``The majority
of guys who played at the highest level get disillusioned when they
go down to a lower level. But as a player, this is where you start.
So why should it be any different for a coach?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs began as the Worcester Wildfire, but after two
losing seasons and low attendance, they moved closer to Boston.
They are both in competition and in cooperation with the
Revolution, as a developmental team as well as a sparring partner.
</P>
<P>
   Nichol's first view of an MLS team was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon for me to judge the level of play here,'' Nichol
said. ``I didn't know what to expect, so I've been taking it as it
comes. But I'm treating it as I would if this were the Premier
League, trying to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity for me because I can both play and
coach, plus get a sample of what America is like. I don't know how

BOOK OFFERS A DIFFERENT PORTRAIT OF MOTHERHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Photographer Barbara Seyda wrote her
award-winning book on lesbian mothers as an implement for social
change, but also to celebrate ``motherhood of all kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I first thought of it at a 1993 Thanksgiving dinner, with
several lesbian friends and their children,'' said Seyda, the
co-author of ``Women in Love: Portraits of Lesbian Mothers and
Their Families'' (Bulfinch Press). ``It was like a post-modern
Norman Rockwell painting, with all ages and ethnicities. And I
realized these are faces you never see in the mainstream media or
in parenting magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Seyda, a lesbian, knows whereof she speaks. The photojournalist,
speaking by telephone from her home in Arizona, first tried to make
a magazine article out of the photos she had taken _ of a
collection of same-sex families _ only to have a publication kill
it at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they tried to get me to take a different angle _ like
talk about how screwed up the kids were from this lifestyle,'' she
said. ``But they weren't. Most seemed very happy. When I made it
clear I wasn't going to alter my story, they killed it.''
</P>
<P>
   When she tried to sell publishers on the idea of a book on the
subject, none, as she put it, ``would touch it with a 10-foot
pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Seyda did not give up. She and her partner and co-author, Diana
Herrera, an acupuncturist, instead went about seeking donations to
publish the book themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It took two years, but by the end of 1997 they had collected
$85,000 from investors and donors and traveled the country
photographing and interviewing lesbian mothers and their children.
``We slept on couches. People gave us gas money, made us dinner. We
were welcomed everywhere in the community. There was a lot of
belief in what we were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were worth the effort. A highly attended photo
exhibit was held last year at San Francisco Main Library, and just
last weekend Seyda and Herrera picked up an award in Los Angeles
from Lambda, the national gay rights organization, for best
photography/visual arts book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to be acknowledged by my peers,'' Seyda said.
</P>
<P>
   To her, acknowledgment and acceptance of the lesbian family unit
are overdue. ``There are around 10 million lesbian mothers out
there,'' she said, ``and around 60 to 70 percent of all lesbian
couples will have children. What we're witnessing is an incredible
evolution of women's consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few hitches in the project, not the least of
which was getting teen-agers to talk about their families. ``That
was tough, but I think that would be normal with any teen-agers,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the children we interviewed said they knew that if
their mothers were happy, they'd be happier, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Seyda is completing a project documenting stories and portraits
of homeless people, called ``Desert Nomads: A Celebration of
Survival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another difficult story, but another that deserves to be
told,'' she said.

BEAUTY BECOMES A BEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Open your eyes,'' murmurs a voice. For Cesar, the slightly
morose, self-involved protagonist of ``Open your Eyes,'' even when
he's got the world on a string, still it ain't got that swing.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping in and out of affairs as easily as he jumps from one
car to another, Cesar looks a little glum, his eyebrows poised over
his dimpled face like question marks. In playing him, Eduardo
Noriega is an aware enough actor to understand that a little bit of
misery around the edges is more than enough to give the slick
wizardry of ``Open Your Eyes'' a touch of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a European aspect, but he looks to be the tiniest bit
ashamed of leading a life that appears to have been Xeroxed from a
1969 issue of Playboy. He's rich, effortlessly charming and chooses
to never sleep with the same woman twice.
</P>
<P>
   And one of those women _ his latest conquest, Nuria (Najwa
Nimri), a catlike beauty with confident hips and a dark, sensuous
helmet of short hair _ is stalking him. She doesn't confuse their
night of passion with love, but she's not ready to give him up,
either.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something remote about Cesar. Even though he's
surrounded with the kind of lifestyle that probably only R. Kelly
knows on such an intimate basis, he's lonely. But the picture
doesn't play that up. Rather, it's in his performance. That is,
until at his birthday party he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz), the
woman who his best friend has just started to date.
</P>
<P>
   Using Sofia as a way to keep away from his stalker, his
flirtation with her actually takes on a romantic constancy that, if
you'll pardon the expression, opens his eyes. He runs off with his
new love and they spend a night together, but it's an evening of
friendly intimacy that doesn't involve sex. When he emerges in the
morning, his ex, Nuria, offers to drive him home. She swallows a
handful of pills and drives off the road. She's left dead, and his
face is a mass of misshapen scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise has already bought the American remake rights to
``Open Your Eyes.'' That seems a little strange, because the movie
appears to be set in the Spanish-language version of Metropolis, a
verdant urban sprawl that suggests not a hint of the flavor of the
culture in which it was filmed. If it were dubbed into English, you
could almost mistake it for an American movie.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Open Your Eyes'' is set in what is on its way to (slowly)
becoming a subgenre: the don't-trust-your-eyes school of
filmmaking, like ``The Matrix'' and last fall's ``What Dreams May
Come.'' After the accident, we're plunged into a series of scenes
that makes us wonder if Cesar is crazy _ sometimes he wanders the
streets totally unscarred, as if nothing has happened. He has been
jailed, because he may have murdered his ex. And his psychiatrist
is determined to get to the truth, shake away the delusions and at
least heal his patient spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   With his loose swagger and head on a constant pivot _ he's
always looking around for something more interesting than what's
going on around him _ Eduardo Noriega has a self-possessed fluidity
that makes him seem older than his years. His performance _ as well
as the even, cool direction of Alejandro Amenabar _ contradicts the
low-tech, science-fiction feel that ``Open Your Eyes'' develops (it
starts to feel a little like Jean-Luc Godard's ``Alphaville'').
Their efforts make this one of the most uniquely entertaining
movies of the year. Its melancholy lingers long after you've walked
away from the theater.

MR. SHIMPI GOES TO CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Internet publishers have millions of dollars to play with,
and some merely have a life-consuming passion. Never bet against
the fellow with a fire in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Time Warner Inc. announced it would shut down
Pathfinder, its ambitious effort to establish the first great
Internet portal. Time Warner began Pathfinder in 1994, when hardly
anybody else was even thinking about such a venture. And the
company spent $15 million a year in an effort to build an audience.
All for naught.
</P>
<P>
   How can the publisher of Time and People and Sports Illustrated
fail to attract Web users? By burying its most valuable properties
at the Pathfinder site, Time Warner failed to capitalize on the
appeal of its biggest brands.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a mistake made by my favorite Web 'zines. These
low-budget start-ups create their own brands through their sheer
fervent love of technology and good writing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Anand Shimpi. He lived in Northampton till
1991, then moved with his family to Raleigh, N.C. A couple of years
ago, while taking a shower, Shimpi had an idea for a personal Web
site celebrating his passion for technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shimpi had little hope of becoming a Web celebrity. After all,
gearhead Web sites abound, from amateur efforts like his own to
major tech sites developed by major companies. Besides, Shimpi had
only one computer to write about _ his own. After all, he was only
a 14-year-old high school freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shimpi took a month to design his site and write a review
of a new processor chip he'd bought. ``It wasn't the highest in
quality,'' Shimpi recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1997, Shimpi's site was good enough to attract a
stream of visitors, including the owner of a now-defunct computer
business who offered to provide sample parts in exchange for free
advertising. Soon, the site was truly worth visiting, crammed with
dozens of up-to-date hardware reviews, most of them written by
Shimpi himself at night, on weekends, and between classes.
</P>
<P>
   Today Shimpi has his own Internet domain, www.anandtech.com, a
couple of part-time employees, a steady stream of advertising
income and, he claims, 40,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   I applied another rough-and-ready test of Web-site popularity.
With the AltaVista search engine, you can see how many Web pages
contain links to a particular site. People link to someone else's
site if they like it and want others to visit it, so this is a good
popularity test. There are about 11,000 Web pages with links to
Salon, the red-hot Internet magazine backed by millions of Silicon
Valley bucks. Meanwhile, Anandtech, run out of Shimpi's bedroom and
relying on word of mouth, has built up over 4,000 links.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be a rocket scientist to do this,'' says
Shimpi. ``All you have to be, I think, is dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say _ he's planning to attend MIT. Then again,
maybe he's right. Ken Fisher is no rocket scientist. He's studying
ancient languages at Harvard Divinity School. But when he's not
reading Caesar's Commentaries, he becomes ``Caesar,'' self-taught
computer network administrator and technology buff.
</P>
<P>
   He and three of his Divinity School buddies run Ars Technica
(www.ars-technica.com), a relatively new, absolutely cool
technology site. Born in September of last year, Ars Technica takes
in only enough ad revenue to cover its Web hosting fees. But
already it's come to be regarded as an authoritative source of
information on the latest processors and graphics accelerators.
``We set out to make ours a biased news source,'' says Fisher.
``We're kidding ourselves if we try to say we're totally objective.
So we just set out to do this great thing, have a lot of fun, and
all of a sudden we're an authority.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of sites like Ars Technica and Anandtech out
there, assembled by dedicated amateurs with brains and attitude.
They're entering the game a lot later than Time Warner's
Pathfinder, and with a lot less money to burn _ just talent and
passion. And often, that's plenty.

STELLAR '99 PUTS WINDSOR FUND BACK IN FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the old clothes in your closet, Charles Freeman has finally
come back in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel validated here,'' said Freeman, in an interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Freeman has managed the money in
Vanguard's Windsor fund, one of America's best-known mutual funds.
Freeman himself works for Boston-based Wellington Management.
Freeman had a strong 1996, a so-so 1997 and a perfectly awful 1998.
In a year when the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index climbed 28 percent,
Windsor returned less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors noticed and began withdrawing money from the fund.
Vanguard noticed too. In March the mutual-fund giant said it was
bringing in new managers from Sanford C. Bernstein to help Freeman
run the fund. Vanguard said its action wasn't a response to
Windsor's poor performance, but to the rest of the world it looked
as if Freeman had gotten the hook.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the manager may have yanked Freeman too early.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Windsor was up 18.4 percent for the year,
compared with 8.8 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 Index. So far this year
the $18 billion Windsor fund has the best performance among the
nation's 30 largest mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   What explains the dramatic turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   It's the economy, stupid. In this case, the world economy.
Windsor got hammered in 1997 and 1998 when Asia, then Russia, then
Brazil, ran into trouble. The bad news hurt the world economy and
sent investors scrambling for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman owned commodity companies when the price of commodities
was tumbling; he owned mid-cap stocks when large-cap stocks were in
vogue; and he owned virtually no technology stocks when investors
could not get enough Microsoft and Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Freeman stuck to his guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest enemy you face in a period like that is the market
saying you are wrong,'' he says. ``What you do is check your cards
and think about what you own. We felt we had unappreciated value in
our portfolio that would be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   For that value to be recognized, however, Freeman needed some
recovery in the world economy. In an interview last fall, he
predicted such a recovery would begin in the next year, that the
recovery would cause the stock market to broaden out, and that
long-neglected stocks would come back into favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a classic turning point,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Within the last few months, the economic news has
been better than expected. Brazil isn't falling into a deep
recession. Parts of Asia have begun to recover. And the already
strong American economy has been stronger than anyone predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of strength have boosted commodity prices. Oil has
gone from $12 a barrel to $19 a barrel. The price of metals and
agricultural products has climbed as well.
</P>
<P>
   The shift has triggered a major runup in the stock prices of
industries Freeman has owned all along _ energy, paper, chemicals,
and farm equipment. Bank stocks have come back too. So have
hospitals and health maintenance organizations. Freeman owns all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, he doesn't own the stocks that have lost
their luster _ the technology giants or the big consumer companies
like Coke, Gillette, or Procter &AMP; Gamble. In effect, the whole
market has rotated around, and for the moment, Freeman is standing
on top.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed. While conceding that cyclical stocks
were ready for a rebound, Ned Riley thinks the euphoria about the
stocks isn't justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this rally has extended too far,'' says Riley, chief
investment officer of BankBoston. Others worry that a sustained
rebound in commodity prices would spark inflation fears, which, in
turn, could send the whole stock market tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman isn't too worried. He believes many of the stocks he
owns ``still have legs.'' He expects the world economy to improve
this year and next, but he doesn't look for growth so robust that
it would ignite inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And how does he feel about Vanguard's move to split up the fund
and bring in new managers?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask Vanguard about that,'' he says
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   A Vanguard spokesman says the Bernstein team will take over a
piece of the fund in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will bring added diversity to the portfolio,''
says the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will. But in a business where timing is everything,
Freeman might have been in a stronger position if the stock market
had decided to rotate just a few months earlier.

BIOPURE BANKS ON ITS BLOOD SUBSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We drink milk. We eat filet mignon. So why not purify cow's
blood and inject it in humans?
</P>
<P>
   Biopure Corp. already stood out among the few biotechnology
companies in the decade-long marathon to be first to win the US
Food and Drug Administration's approval for a human-blood
substitute. The tiny Cambridge, Mass. firm has a medical celebrity
on its board, former surgeon general C. Everett Koop, touting a
safe substitute as destined to be among the ``top 10 advances'' in
modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure is alone in having FDA permission to sell a blood
substitute to veterinarians for use in treating dogs. And now it's
a frontrunner in developing a more pure product for use in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also seen it used in cats successfully,'' Dr. Robert
Murtaugh, director of critical care at the Dove Lewis Emergency
Animal Hospital in Portland, Ore., said about the veterinary
product. It's ``revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay ahead in the human-blood market, Biopure and cofounder
Carl Rausch, the company's chief scientist, are at a critical stage
in testing their therapeutic, which analysts say could one day be a
multimillion-dollar industry. Biopure has the daunting challenge of
convincing not only regulators but also investors _ and a wary
public _ that the idea of using bovine blood in humans will fly.
</P>
<P>
   Although faux blood is not a perfect substitute for the real
thing, it could be important in supplementing blood-bank supplies.
Substitutes don't need to be matched with a patient's blood type,
giving them a variety of medical uses, such as during surgeries or
emergencies when the real thing is unsafe or in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   But memories of the breakout of ``mad cow disease'' in the
United Kingdom two years ago won't help Biopure's cause, despite
meticulous care taken by the company to protect its Pennsylvania
herd until the cattle are slaughtered and their blood collected for
processing.
</P>
<P>
   Qualms about using substances from other species ``would
certainly be one reason why most people, given a choice between cow
blood and human blood, would take human blood,'' said George Annas,
professor of health law at Boston University's School of Public
Health. ``It's like genetically modified food. There's no evidence
it hurts anybody, but if you label it nobody eats it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Biopure can think about marketing its blood, the company
needs an infusion of cash to pay for costly clinical trials
required by FDA to gain the agency's approval. Biopure is expected
to file, possibly within days, for its first public sale of stock.
</P>
<P>
   If Biopure does sell stock in coming weeks, it would be entering
a market dazzled by Internet stocks and inhospitable to fledgling
biotech firms. Not a single biotech company has done an initial
public offering this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Biopure deal would be ``a bellwether biotech offering,'' said
Peter Feinstein, a consultant with Feinstein Kean Partners Inc. in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure's spokesman, Doug Sayles, declined comment on the
company's plans. As of Wednesday, it had not filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Fernandez, president of Schooner Capital, a venture
capital firm backing Biopure, said in a voice-mail message last
week, ``I'm not going to be able to talk to you about the company
until after the'' initial public offering. She did not return a
call seeking further comment.
</P>
<P>
   On a purely scientific level, competition to find a human blood
substitute is intense.
</P>
<P>
   FDA requirements for a therapeutic with so many applications are
stringent, and Northfield Laboratories Inc. is breathing down
Biopure's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Northfield, like Biopure, is in phase III _ or final _ clinical
trials. And both are shooting for FDA approval to begin selling
their product next year.
</P>
<P>
   Northfield's chief executive, Richard Dewoskin, said in a
telephone interview last week that his company's product, PolyHeme,
has the advantage that it can be administered in larger doses than
Biopure's product, Hemopure.
</P>
<P>
   Northfield is using up to 20 units in clinical trials, while
Biopure is approved for only 10 units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposed you're injured in an auto accident and you're
bleeding badly _ you could go into shock and die in minutes,''
DeWoskin explained. PolyHeme could be pumped ``in the patient until
they have no blood left _ that's what it is for.''
</P>
<P>
   Northfield's product is made from human _ not bovine _
hemoglobin. New Jersey-based Enzon Inc. is the only other company
developing a bovine-derived substitute, but its product is in early
stages of research.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure touts Hemopure as being highly efficient in carrying
oxygen, so large amounts aren't as crucial. And the company has the
advantage of already having proved a veterinary blood product as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' Rausch said in an interview in February. ``No
question it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Biopure announced it would launch phase III trials
on 640 American patients for orthopedic surgery. In November, the
company reported to the American Heart Association that Hemopure
reduced the need for transfusions in cardiac-surgery patients
during second-phase trials. Biopure said it has also tested its
blood on in human patients in Guatemala and Europe, with success.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a blood substitute gained steam in the early
1980s as a way to prevent transfusions, which carried new risks of
transmitting infectious diseases, namely HIV and hepatitis. There
are more than 12 million transfusions a year in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen-carrying blood substitutes may one day minimize
transfusions by creating a ``bridge'' until the body regenerates
its own red blood cells, physicians say. And Biopure said Hemopure
can be stored, at room temperature, in ambulances or on hospital
shelves for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``The regulatory hurdles are going to be pretty
formidable,'' said Katherine Martinelli, a medical technology
analyst for Merrill Lynch in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On top of regulatory hurdles are the financial ones.
Biotechnology companies typically are strapped, because they
consume vast quantities of cash, especially in costly clinical
trials, which can run at $10 million apiece or more.
</P>
<P>
   Northfield, for example, lost $5.8 million last year but has
raised cash in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Biopure's financial status, since the
company is private.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure said it had $2 million in revenue last year, about half
from the sale of animal-blood substitute. The last time on record
that Biopure received any funds was in December 1997 when $50
million was raised from venture capital investments.
</P>
<P>
   But Biopure needs money to fund clinical trials, Rausch said in
the interview. And Northfield and Biopure are close in the race.
Northfield may have a slight lead in its third-stage trials,
analysts say, but Biopure has shown that a similar product works
for animals.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Harvey Klein, chief of transfusion medicine at the
Warren G. Magnuson Clinic at the National Institutes of Health, who
has consulted to Biopure, said that although the company has ``a
good technique'' for turning bovine blood into a blood-substitute
for humans, there are always ``unknown'' toxicities, which may not
come to light even in the best-designed, most extensive clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the race, Baxter International, was forced to
abandon its trials last March after researchers, during the third
phase of testing, found that use of its product caused ``an
increased mortality compared to those in the control group'' on
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter has fallen behind in the race. The Chicago company is now
pursuing a blood substitute based on a new technology developed by
a small biotech company, Somatogen, that Baxter acquired last year.
But, Baxter has fallen behind _ ``we're talking 2004,'' Martinelli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure's secret formula for its blood substitute is based on a
purification process using chromatography and designed by Rausch, a
chemical engineer by training, and the company's other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Rausch was one of four founders of Biopure, which grew
out of their joint research at the enzyme research center at Tufts
University. His partners are the center's ex-director, Bing Wong;
physician Edward Jacobs of Massachusetts General Hospital; and a
former Gulf &AMP; Western Industries founder, Jim Judelson.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after starting their research, Rausch said,
Biopure ``is a company with a real product.''

HOME VIDEOS STINK? WITH THIS SOFTWARE, YOU'RE A SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images are familiar to millions of video camera owners
around the world:
</P>
<P>
   The wedding shots that linger far too long.
</P>
<P>
   The blurry video of children playing.
</P>
<P>
   The footage from that time you thought the camera was off, but
it was actually recording and videotaping your feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great if there was an easy way to edit your very
obviously amateur video efforts?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since I bought my first video camera earlier this decade, I
have struggled with one crude editing solution after another. The
best solution to date: Dumping my 8mm camera tape onto a VHS
cassette and fast forwarding through the less appealing scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the quest for better editing, I recently experimented with
four products that promise high-quality, easy-to-use video editing
on your home PC.
</P>
<P>
   The results of my efforts after far too many hours of plugging,
loading, playing, and editing are mixed. Video editing on your
desktop computer is possible, and in some cases, worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, be prepared to spend several, sometimes
frustrating, hours installing a video capture card, learning the
editing software, and trying to figure out how to hook up your
video camera to the various devices that link it to the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Be advised that video editing software promises to test the full
ability of your PC. These programs, and the video clip files they
create, are space hogs. To edit a video that will run 30 minutes,
you can plan on using a couple of gigabytes of storage space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition you need a computer with optimal processing speed
and as much memory as possible. If you have an older model PC,
forget about video editing.
</P>
<P>
   When the evolution of PC video editing is traced, these will
certainly be considered the primitive years. However, a quantum
leap in technology is just around the corner; by the end of the
year, several products are expected to exploit a new video standard
that will dramatically improve the editing experience.
</P>
<P>
   The four products I used all sell for about $100. But software
is not the only expense you will incur if you want to edit videos
on your PC. You're going to need a video capture card to link your
PC to your video camera or VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting your PC to an external device became much simpler
with the advent of the Universal Serial Bus, known as USB,
installed in most PCs built after 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzle Multimedia's Photo Maker comes with a small, colorful
external video adapter that connects through your computer's USB
port. You simply plug it in to the back of the machine and it is
ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   For those who get queasy at the thought of taking apart a
computer and inserting an internal video card, this external drive
is the perfect solution. The Dazzle installation guide and user
manual are clearly written and simple to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzle comes with the necessary cables to connect your video
camera directly to the video adapter. After completing a simple
software installation, you can begin using the editing interface.
The video creator allows you to split, cut, trim and rearrange your
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the slickest video editing package available, but it
does a nice job of performing the type of bare-bones editing many
home users desire.
</P>
<P>
   There are several software packages that offer slicker editing,
complete with tools to add music, titles, narration, and fancy
transitions between scenes.
</P>
<P>
   I tried three of the best-sellers: Ulead's Video Studio 3.0,
Avid Cinema 1.0, and MGI's VideoWave 1.5.
</P>
<P>
   The products are similar in terms of the kind of editing that is
possible and the extra features you can add to your home video. The
differences are apparent in the ease in which you can edit your
video and the time and effort involved. The clear winner in this
regard was Avid Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing video from your camera is easy, and within minutes I
was busily trimming video, adding background music, creating
titles, and introducing voice narration.
</P>
<P>
   The Avid Cinema editing interface was the most intuitive of the
products I sampled. A series of tabs at the top of the viewer
window takes you through the four steps of editing your video and
creating a new home movie. In the editing tab, a series of new tabs
appear to add sound, create special effects and add titles. At the
bottom of the viewer, a complete outline of all your editing
efforts appears and various video and audio sequences can be moved
about to suit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done editing your video, Avid Cinema allows you to
preview your finished product on the full computer screen or save
it directly to videotape.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drawbacks to Avid Cinema is that it will work only
with five kinds of video capture cards. It will not work, for
instance, with the Dazzle video capture device that connects to the
USB port.
</P>
<P>
   I used the ATI All-In-Wonder Pro video card, which has to be
installed in an expansion slot inside your computer. Installing the
card took only 10 minutes. However, I encountered a problem trying
to get the audio to work with the card. After an hour of
troubleshooting and checking all of the possible audio settings on
my computer, I logged onto the ATI homepage. In a troubleshooting
section, under audio, I learned there was a ``patch cable'' I had
to connect between the card and my line input plug to get the audio
to work. It was disappointing that this information was nowhere to
be found in the manual that comes with the card.
</P>
<P>
   While the audio problem was frustrating, the added bonus of
buying the All-In-Wonder card is the ability to watch TV on your
PC. After plugging the TV cable into the video capture card, you
can take advantage of a slick TV tuner that adjusts to whatever
size you want.
</P>
<P>
   I purchased the All-In-Wonder card for $169, but it came bundled
with several software products, including MGI's VideoWave.
VideoWave does many of the same things as Avid Cinema and has a
useful video tutorial. I didn't find the editing interface to be as
friendly or intuitive as Avid Cinema's.
</P>
<P>
   The final product tested was Ulead's VideoStudio, billed as the
fastest way to great home videos. My biggest problem with this
product was the so-called ``rendering'' process, in which video
files are compressed and uncompressed.
</P>
<P>
   I found rendering often took hours, even for clips only minutes
long. In fact, the user's manual suggests rendering really big
projects ``overnight or while you are at work.''
</P>
<P>
   And here I thought the days of having to let a program run
overnight had gone the way of dual 5 1/4-inch floppy disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Ulead product manager Brent McKendry suspected the problem with
my excessive rendering time was the format of the files I captured,
and suggested several helpful tips for reducing rendering time. One
was to create a template reflecting the exact capture rate of the
video file I was using. This helped, but not to the extent that I
could ever recommend using the product.
</P>
<P>
   On an optimistic note, McKendry said problems with rendering
time are certain to become obsolete with the advent of a new
standard for capturing video files.
</P>
<P>
   The standard adopted by most of the computer industry is MPEG-1,
which stands for Motion Pictures Expert Group. As your video is
captured, it is compressed and decompressed using a mathematical
algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, several programs are expected to start using
a new compression scheme known as MPEG-2, which McKendry said will
offer DVD-quality videos and dramatically reduce the demands placed
on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is fantastic,'' he said. At least it will have
better home videos.

AS TRUE TO LIFE AS YOUR GAL-PALS GET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' caused quite a stir at the 1998
Cannes Film Festival, where its stars shared the Best Actress
award. Although the movie has taken almost a year to get a release
in America, it's well worth the wait. It's a detailed examination
of two young women floating through a period of disconnectedness.
Although they turn to each other to fill empty spaces in their
lives, neither can answer the big questions they have.
</P>
<P>
   The stars seem to have been matched as if they were right out of
a road-picture buddy comedy, and their relationship sounds a little
pat. Isa (Elodie Bouchez) is a natural sweetpea, and her sunny
outlook helps her sail through life as if she has a lucky charm
bracelet hidden in her backpack. Her pal, Marie (Natacha Regnier)
is her polar opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds brew behind her eyes, and her dark temperament
masks a deep-seated desperation. This bent toward misery attracts
her to the wrong kind of guy, like the nightclub owner with a cold,
mean streak; he treats her like sewage. But first-time director
Erick Zonca doesn't play up the cheap melodrama, which would make
``Dreamlife'' a satisfying piece on its own: ``When Bad Things
Happen to Pouty People.'' Instead, he focuses on the minor details
of how the young women get through each day, and builds the movie
into a novelistic piece of observation.
</P>
<P>
   Marie can't seem to help herself. And ``Dreamlife'' makes no
excuses for her, nor does it try to offer a big explanation as to
why these women have fallen in together. It just follows them
through a period with no big drama, and the collection of anecdotes
_ minor flirtations, wasting their days squabbling over nothing _
isn't emphasized with grandiose technique.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Dreamlife'' suggests the kind of foreign film we
don't see much of anymore. It's an empathetic glimpse into the
lives of people whom American movies would be nervous to depict,
because there's not enough conflict in their lives. And the lack of
contrivance would be confused with an absence of drama, because not
much happens. It's said that the first cut of ``Dreamlife'' ran
close to four hours, and if that's the case, Zonca has made
judicious cuts. The drama here cuts close to the bone.

SMART KITCHENS WILL HAVE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Beneath a glass bowl and a jar of peanuts on
the fourth floor of the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge rests the single person's answer to a
cooking catastrophe: an intelligent kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   How many nuts? Too few means candy with no crunch; too many
makes the dessert crumbly.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the recipe; just pour those peanuts into the bowl. Yawn,
maybe daydream. The counter top will tell you _ yes, it will speak
to you _ to stop when there are enough nuts in the bowl. It'll tell
you to pick up the butter next, and let you know when you've added
the right amount. A few more steps and presto: perfect peanut
brittle, every time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept, anyway, behind a five-year research project
at MIT called Counter Intelligence. Started last October, the
kitchen of the future is being created here: Intelligent coffee
machines that know to make a double espresso at 8 a.m., microwaves
that know how long to cook frozen French toast to perfection,
refrigerators that know exactly what needs to be reordered on
grocery day.
</P>
<P>
   The founding spirit behind this project is Joseph Kaye, a
22-year-old MIT graduate whose goal is to create a completely
personalized kitchen. Kaye will begin studying for his master's
degree next year by donning an apron and mixing cutting-edge
item-identification technology with coffee, cookies, and anything
else he can figure out how to make ``smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Kaye wants to turn your entire kitchen into a
humming computer. Appliances could communicate with each other.
Lights, for example, could flash when the washing machine reaches
the spin cycle. The kitchen would track coffee gone from the pantry
shelves, ice cream taken from the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   The technology relies on a replacement for bar codes called
Radio Frequency Identification, or RFID. It's already used in
automated toll collecting _ like the new Massachusetts Fast Lane
program in effect at the eastern end of the Massachusetts Turnpike.
Like bar codes, RFID tags contain specific information: In the case
of Fast Lane, names and addresses for billing; in grocery shopping,
the price of, say, a bag of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Java, Counter Intelligence's first creation, uses the tag
technology. A souped-up Acorto 2000 coffee maker, it sits in a
cramped student and faculty kitchen on the third floor of the Media
Lab.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people in the building have coffee cups with round RFID
tags glued to the bottom of the cup. The tags contain a computer
chip that holds information about the cup owner's coffee
preferences. A sensor underneath the spout on the machine reads the
tag and pours: latte, a little extra milk, extra large. Your
special coffee, perfect every time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a computer keeps careful track of the coffee that
leaves the machine, whether it goes into the special tagged coffee
mugs or a visitor's styrofoam cup. It registers what type of coffee
is dispensed, how much, and at exactly what time.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent demonstration, Mr. Java was feeling fickle. But
when running smoothly and efficiently, it is easy to see that its
ability to gather specific data about individual cups of coffee has
huge implications for tracking information not only in coffee
shops, but in grocery stores and warehouses. It's why Kaye has
companies like Kraft and Nestle underwriting his research.
</P>
<P>
   Today, grocery stores keep track of items when their bar codes
are scanned in at the register. But the process can be cumbersome;
bar codes must be read individually and can be difficult to scan if
they are dirty or torn. Meanwhile, expensive manpower must be used
to take inventory of the products still on the shelves. With RFID
technology, inventory could become completely computerized and more
efficient. Because the RFID tags can be read through a product and
from farther away than bar codes, each item could be equipped with
a tag and the shelves embedded with sensors, enabling workers to
know exactly what's on every shelf at all times. Sold items can be
reordered more easily, items found more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the RFID technology could mean that many tags are
read almost at once: Just push your shopping cart past a device
that reads the tags on all your items and tallies the final price.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, your kitchen will do essentially the same thing:
Keep constant track of almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a computer on a table, you'd have a computer all
around you, all the time,'' says Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, particularly if it is linked to kitchen
machines, may mean big business for appliance makers. Kaye is now
consulting for a European appliance manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the technology is not complete and, like Mr. Java, the
machines are just prototypes. And some ideas simply didn't work
out, like a refrigerator with a bar code scanner: it was too
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sketches out the future, he sees great things: a smart
washing machine, a revised refrigerator. Kaye, a bachelor, doesn't
plan on letting kitchens do all the work in the future. He adores
cooking. He just wants the milk to be fresh and in the
refrigerator, the flour on the pantry shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he wants the peanut brittle to be perfect, every
time.

<P>
   It's 1999. Where is my robot, dammit?
</P>
<P>
   I grew up watching ``The Jetsons'' and believing the promise of
science that someday, in the kitchen of my future, would stand an
automated matron in an apron, scrubbing pots and pans and mixing
martinis at the push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   But here it is, 30 years later, and the closest I'm going to get
to a Rosie of my own is if I hotwire the blender to the dishwasher,
toss in a cocktail onion, and press ``pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   Futurists from Walt Disney to World's Fair hawkers had some
interesting ideas about how technology was going to revolutionize
our lives by this point, but so far, many of those predictions have
fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   If their dreams did come true, we'd be buying gyrocopters on
clearance at Wal-Mart by now, and time-travel machines would be
given away free with time-share offers. Michael Jackson most
certainly would have gone for the icy cryogenic chamber instead of
the breathy hyperbaric.
</P>
<P>
   And homes, not ``Bay Watch'' actresses, would be made entirely
of plastic, although Monsanto's motto would still apply: ``Hardly a
natural material appears anywhere!''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, spectators munched cotton
candy and mused about a 21st century where disposable clothing
would be all the rage, man-made lightning would fire up the skies,
and school buildings would have walls formed by jets of air and
floating roofs that would shift to the angle of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Just what was in that cotton candy, anyway? Oh, yeah _ it
was the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, let's examine how close they got: Diapers are disposable,
but lightning remains an act of God (although sparks can certainly
be created by the right man), and schools do have shifting walls,
but it's called decay.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens were an easy and popular target for futurists, who
enjoyed wowing women with tantalizing gadgets to make the
``housewife's'' life that much easier, like solar ovens,
thermo-electric refrigerators, talking toasters, cordless waffle
irons, and disposable dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to a man to conceive the paper plate, but have no
inkling of the nascent feminist movement. Or of takeout, for
heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there were some things the prognosticators got right
over the years. They accurately surmised we'd be living in the
suburbs watching televisions and using super highways to get to
work, where we would be dependent on fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   Even more things, though, were only a little bit right or the
result of wishful thinking: Videophones were unveiled at the 1964
World's Fair, but we're guessing that Bill Gates was too young then
to monopolize the idea and sell them with a Rolling Stones theme
song.
</P>
<P>
   Cars, they said, would be air conditioned, but also
teardrop-shaped, float on air, and cost only $200. Clearly, they
were really talking about sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of cars, the General Motors exhibit at the 1939 World's
Fair displayed a city with tall, curving towers ringed by expanses
of greenery. At the base of the towers, highways met in massive
intersections more than 20 lanes wide. No pedestrians were in
sight. The Big Dig run amok?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the allure of exhibits called Town of Tomorrow, Soda
Fountain of the Future, and World of the Day after Tomorrow, the
biggest buzz was always around the robot.
</P>
<P>
   It would have had the most immediate and long-lasting impact on
improving everyday life. Enthralled spectators envisioned the joys
of programming a machine to cook dinner, walk the dog, iron the
clothes, and mow the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, we're still rooting for a robot and for the
same basic reasons. But today, we'd give it different jobs. Like
program it to find loopholes in the tax laws. Teach it to surf the
Net for cheap airfares.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one more: Program the VCR to record those good ol'
Jetsons' reruns.

HIGH-STAKES RACE TO REPLACE KALB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was all smiles Tuesday as the brothers Kalb (veteran
journalists Marvin and Bernie) marked the end of Marvin's 12 years
as director of Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy with a ``brown bag'' lunch featuring a
light menu of media conversation and fraternal reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, the high-stakes race to land a big
fish to succeed Kalb _ who leaves at the end of June for
Shorenstein's Washington office _ is getting deadly serious. In an
era when press scrutiny has become a huge growth industry,
Shorenstein's reputation as one of the nation's most influential
think tanks _ capable of attracting visiting scholars and
celebrities _ is at stake in the selection of the director who will
follow the man who put it on the map.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Harvard is saying anything officially and the
situation appears fluid. But several contenders have reportedly
emerged as major candidates: Ken Bode, the dean of Northwestern's
prestigious Medill School of Journalism; media critic Alex Jones,
who shares the Eugene Patterson chair in journalism at Duke
University with his wife, Susan Tifft; Newsweek assistant managing
editor and Washington pundit Evan Thomas; and former NBC News
president turned editor and co-owner of The (Ames, Iowa) Daily
Tribune, Michael Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate potentially in the mix is Ed Fouhy, the former
network newsman and director of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism
who now edits an online news service dealing with major issues
facing the states.
</P>
<P>
   A number of names _ from ABC's Ted Koppel to CNN's Jeff
Greenfield to former White House press secretary Mike McCurry _ had
reportedly been bandied around to succeed Kalb before the selection
process got more pragmatic. And no one is ruling out the idea that
new contenders could emerge before a final decision is made
sometime in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought all along that . . . the date was not the driving
factor here. The fit with the person and the position will be the
key,'' said Thomas Patterson, the Bradlee Professor of Government
and the Press and co-chair of the faculty search committee, who
declined to comment on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the potential directors brings both assets and
liabilities to the table. Bode, a former CNN and NBC staffer, is a
distinguished newsman. He recently made news, however, by losing
his longtime job as host of PBS's ``Washington Week in Review,''
supposedly because the program needed a fiestier feel. He has also
been dean of the Medill School for a mere 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a job at Northwestern University,'' said Bode
Wednesday. ``We've instituted a lot of new programs. I'm sitting
here talking to you looking out my window at Lake Michigan.'' Yet,
he acknowledged being approached about the job and said, ``There
probably is no other job in the county I would consider leaving
this job for except that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has spent much of his career as a professional media
critic. A 1987 Pulitzer winner, he was a media reporter at The New
York Times, the host of National Public Radio's ``On the Media''
program and he is currently executive editor of PBS's ``Media
Matters'' series. Like Bode, his position at Duke gives him an
academic cache, and he and Tifft are authors of ``The Trust: The
Private and Powerful Family Behind the New York Times,'' which is
due out this fall. Jones has some influential backers, but is the
least known of the possible Kalb successors, a potential drawback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I would want the Harvard job,'' he said
Wednesday. ``I don't know very much about what the job would
entail.'' He did say, however, that Patterson had invited him up to
Shorenstein for a meeting, adding ``Sure, I'll be glad to
explore,'' the option.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's Thomas, the grandson of perennial Socialist
presidential candidate Norman Thomas, is on leave while he
completes a biography of Bobby Kennedy. The author of books on the
C.I.A., superlawyer Edward Bennett Williams, and the US foreign
policy establishment, Thomas is a well-connected political writer.
His frequent appearances as a TV pundit _ at a time when many
critics blame talking heads for debasing public dialogue _ could be
a double-edged sword, however.
</P>
<P>
   Like his potential rivals, Thomas downplayed his Shorenstein
candidacy Wednesday. ``That's news to me,'' he replied when asked
if his hat was firmly in the ring. ``I had a conversation with
(Kennedy School executive dean and search committee co-chair)
Sheila Burke, but I haven't heard back. Obviously that's a great
job and I'm flattered, but I'm happy at Newsweek.''
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial choice might be Gartner. A longtime
newspaper man (Wall Street Journal, Des Moines Register), Gartner's
career as NBC News president literally went up in smoke in 1993
when he resigned after the infamous ``Dateline NBC'' program that
rigged a dramatic truck explosion. Gartner then returned to Iowa to
run the Daily Tribune, became something of a reborn prarie
populist, and won the 1997 Pulitzer for editorial writing. He was
unavailable for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who succeeds him, Kalb may have already secured
his legacy. Noting that ``it took me two or three years before I
was able to establish here at the Kennedy School that there was a
genuine need to study the intersection of press and public
policy,'' he declared that ``first and foremost,'' his successor
must be ``a person who is a journalist and who believes in the
First Amendment.'' Judging from the resumes of the would-be
candidates, that's already a given.

CLICHES CURSE `MUMMY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Brendan Fraser ever blink? His wide-open saucer eyes are
crystal clear _ he looks like he never misses a night's sleep _ and
are a perfect match for director Stephen Sommers's camera style in
``The Mummy,'' an action-picture remake of the classic. It's not
very scary, but it never stops moving. It's relentless, although it
feels like the kind of movie that irony-free B-movie actor Troy
McClure _ the vacuous dumbbell from ``The Simpsons'' _ would star
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mummy'' gets going with an amazing panoramic view of old
Egypt, where a priest with a haunted look on his face pursues an
affair with Pharaoh's woman. After he's caught, he and his men are
put to death in a gloriously photogenic way. They're all buried
alive, and the priest's sarcophagus is filled with flesh-eating
beetles. (Apparently, Pharaoh's not one of those guys whose bad
side you want to be on.)
</P>
<P>
   The priest, who vows to bring his love back to life, is also
buried with a curse: If his tomb is opened, it will loose a plague
upon on the land. As played by Arnold Vosloo, the priest is the
only person in the movie capable of real suffering _ he howls with
rage and pain as his tomb is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   This prologue is a wildly active piece of storytelling (its
perpetual motion, however, makes it seem exhausting). The movie
fades to 1923, where Rick (Fraser) and his men are searching for
the Lost City where, of course, untold riches have been buried (and
where the searchers will inadvertently activate the curse that
releases the Mummy). They're fighting off Egyptians, who are out to
keep them away. Rick's cowardly guide Benny (Kevin J. O'Connor,
who's so weedy and thin he looks like he's auditioning for a Dead
Kennedys bio-pic) abandons him, and Rick barely escapes with his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers was on a kind of archaeological dig of his own when he
wrote the screenplay. He unearths all of the cliches for ``The
Mummy.'' He's included a good-hearted, two-fisted hero (Fraser
stands in front of the camera as if posing for his own action
figure), a slightly out-of-it but spunky scholarly heroine (Rachel
Weisz), and a sweaty, pudgy, greedy _ and smelly _ Egyptian
sidekick, whose depiction may inflame anti-defamation
organizations. Weisz has a face that's open to the camera. When she
hires Fraser (she saves him from hanging), we notice that her
alertness contrasts Fraser's genial, but opaque, quality. He's as
relentless as the movie _ and the Mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers directed ``Deep Rising,'' in which he also tried to
blend horror and comedy, and the result was just as flat-footed.
I'm not sure whether he understands the difference between comedy
and facetiousness. He kids all of the conventions of the genres he
mixes by very carefully invoking them, right down to the verbal
sparring that smells as musty as the sarcophaguses they find.
That's not quite the same as offering laughs, though.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about ``The Mummy'' is that no one can say it's
dishonest. Everything we're told is going to happen, happens. Its
predictability is inexorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mummy'' is gorgeously photographed by Adrian Biddle, the
cinematographer who shoots many of Ridley Scott's films. And the
craftsmen of Industrial Light and Magic supply the computer magic
that gives life to the skeletal creatures _ other than Kevin J.
O'Connor _ that infest the movie. Instead of being liberated by
this, though, the army of virtual evil comes too easily. It'd be
more fun if some of the horror where suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers tries to provide breathlessness by keeping things
slamming along. With Fraser whipping out his guns to blast away
portions of the creatures, the ``Indiana Jones'' movies come to
mind, but Sommers is also out to follow the lead of the high-flying
action of 1939's ``Gunga Din.'' The movie huffs and puffs along,
wearing itself out instead of keeping the audience so keyed up that
it's breathless. The movie's not half bad, because it doesn't take
itself seriously, although it'd be more fun if it were a half-hour
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``The Mummy'' _ which may be the first movie to inspire a
line of clothing from Banana Republic; the cast is beautifully
turned out in linens and earth tones: khakis of the Living Dead _
is in such a hurry because it comes with an expiration date. As of
May 19, it might as well go right to Blockbuster. That's when the
most frightening curse its creators can imagine appears, when
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' is released upon cineplexes
across the land.

ERIC DAVIS'S MESSAGE OF HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN ROMANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BORN TO PLAY 
The Eric Davis Story: Life Lessons in Overcoming Adversity On and
Off the Field 
By Eric Davis with Ralph Wiley 
Viking, 278 pp., illustrated, $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many ways to write a life story. The tone of such a
tale often follows from the author's motives. In the case of major
league baseball player Eric Davis, the tone he has chosen is one of
hope, faith, and resilience. A gifted athlete, his life and career
have been interrupted by numerous injuries, a life-threatening
battle with colon cancer, and the tragic death of his only brother.
One would certainly forgive Davis if he told his story in terms of
sadness or bitterness. But that's not what Davis is all about, and
that's what makes reading his book a must for anyone looking for
encouragement when facing the adversity that life sometimes throws
our way.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is not always told with great detail and depth, but its
effectiveness lies in its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   I first became acquainted with Davis a year ago, just a few
weeks after I had been diagnosed with advanced colon cancer. Davis,
having just completed 36 weeks of chemotherapy following surgery to
remove a large growth from his colon, was about to begin his 14th
season in the majors as a member of the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The previous October he had staged a remarkably quick comeback
from surgery to return to Baltimore's lineup and help the team
finish strong and advance to the American League playoffs. His
efforts won him many awards honoring his courage, but none could
match the inspiration he brought to thousands of people who were
waging a fight against cancer and were watching his every move with
amazement and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of the newest members of the club, I was stunned to
receive a phone call one afternoon from Davis, who had heard of my
plight from Globe baseball writer Gordon Edes. Davis's words of
wisdom were simple and clear. I would trust in God. I would fight.
And I would win.
</P>
<P>
   To be alive to read his autobiography a year later is testament
to several things, not the least of which is that Davis's spirit is
not misplaced. And it's that spirit, a positive, unflappable one,
that resonates throughout his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man or a woman can come back from cancer and not just exist,
but produce at the same level _ at a higher level,'' writes Davis.
``I took 36 chemotherapy treatments prior to the spring of '98. But
I still come to the post. They'll have to tear this uniform off me
one day. And only God determines when the harvest time has gone. I
just keep plugging on, and let His will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis was born 36 years ago in South Central Los Angeles in
an area many people would call a ghetto _ and he called home. The
youngest of three children, he was raised by parents who taught
their kids to practice their faith, work hard, and be
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Although he excelled at basketball, baseball would become the
game of choice for Davis, who signed with the Cincinnati Reds out
of high school in 1980. A fleet outfielder with a powerful batting
stroke, Davis parlayed those talents into starting roles in the
1987 and 1989 All-Star Games and a World Championship with the 1990
Reds. His career could have been even more impressive if not for
the number of injuries the brittle Davis experienced during his
career, including a serious injury to his kidney and a herniated
disk in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was more challenging or taxing than what occurred
during the summer of 1997, when Davis began to experience digestive
problems and pain in his abdomen. After months of tests and
misdiagnoses, he was sent to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore,
where it was determined that he had colon cancer. Just weeks after
he began chemotherapy, he got word that his only brother, Jim, had
died of cardiac arrest at the age of 36, a life wasted on drugs,
gangs, and prison.
</P>
<P>
   Coauthored by former Sports Illustrated writer Ralph Wiley,
Davis's book does not take long to digest. It can easily be read in
a few nights. Davis's writing style is often marked by incomplete
sentences, presented in stream-of-thought style. It is not a great
literary work, but that is not what is important here _ the
important thing is the message.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis, who this year is playing for the St. Louis
Cardinals, has had much success in his life, but with it has come
his share share of tragedy. He has chosen to handle all that with a
remarkable attitude of acceptance spiced with a powerful faith in
God. He chooses not to tell a tale of suffering and heartbreak, but
of how _ out of adversity _ one can learn to appreciate life and
set an example for others to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As one of those for whom he has set an example, I will be
forever grateful to Eric Davis and for the story he has to tell.

REDFORD LAUNCHES ANOTHER SUNDANCE WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It has been Robert Redford's curse his entire
life. You look at that face _ still pretty even though he's not a
boy _ and you expect him to be vapid and boring and perfect for an
``Entertainment Tonight'' sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   Then he talks about vertical integration.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should know by now that Redford is a bright guy and, in
fact, is something of a visionary _ a feat he rarely gets credit
for. He was in San Francisco Wednesday announcing the launch of his
Sundance Channel on the TCI cable system.
</P>
<P>
   A new cable channel _ on the digital package _ doesn't usually
merit a news conference, particularly if, like Sundance, it only
has 20 million subscribers (that's barely surviving in the cable
world).
</P>
<P>
   So Redford pitched his 24-hour showcase for uncut, independent
films. He talked about how happy he was that his 3-year-old channel
finally made it to San Francisco, a fertile ground for independent
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   To his right, the guy no one was looking at was TCI West
President John Kopchik. ``This is a special place to live, and
Sundance brings something special to the Bay area.''
</P>
<P>
   By getting on TCI in the San Francisco area, Redford will add
nearly 1 million new subscribers by the start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But what the news conference really illuminated was Redford's
dogged vision of the Sundance concept _ what is better known these
days as synergy, but what was probably dismissed 20 years ago when
he formed his filmmaker's lab as Redford's Folly.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out he was way ahead of his time, and while the buzz
phrase in Hollywood now is ``vertical integration or die,'' damned
if the tousle-haired pretty boy doesn't have a lock on it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sundance concept started 20 years ago, Redford knew he
needed a distribution outlet for the films, hence the Sundance Film
Festival five years later. ``That turned out to be more popular
than we'd imagined,'' he said, in one massive understatement.
</P>
<P>
   With the festival becoming a meat market of hype and glory,
Redford started the Sundance Channel in 1996, as a small-screen
vehicle for those films. And now he's launching Sundance Cinema
Centers _ his own theaters, basically.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he's got a Web site, too (www.sundancechannel.com).
</P>
<P>
   That's a textbook example of vertical integration, perhaps not
the sexiest topic a famous actor could tout, but certainly one that
lends more insight into who he really is than saying, ``I love my
new film.''
</P>
<P>
   Redford the businessman tossed out phrases like ``cross
promotional advantages,'' ``interstitials'' and ``marketplace''
like he was a network honcho.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he is.
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone at the rival Independent Film Channel paying
attention?

LIFETIME LOVERS GLOW IN A WARM `ARCTIC CIRCLE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coincidence is such a screenwriter's tool that Dallas' recent
USA Film Festival could have developed a seminar on it. Everything
from Arthur Penn's classic ``Little Big Man'' to the latest
no-budget indie depended on it. One of the festival entries, the
Spanish import ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle,'' doesn't just rely
on coincidence _ it turns it into part of the movie's myth.
</P>
<P>
   In Julio Medem's beautifully shot romantic drama, which gives
new meaning to the word ``elliptical,'' there aren't many degrees
of separation. The characters keep running into the most unlikely
people in the most unlikely places, from the Spanish Civil War to
the present-day Arctic Circle in Finland. But there is separation,
thanks to the forces that conspire to keep Otto (Fele Martinez) and
Ana (Najwa Nimri) apart as adults, despite a mutual obsession that
began when they were 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Otto, a dreamer even in his grade-school days, encounters the
young Ana as he's chasing an errant soccer ball (in an
astonishingly photographed sequence that's almost worth the price
of admission by itself). One look at Ana's penetrating, questioning
eyes, and Otto's hooked. Too bad that when he finally gets her
attention with a romantic question written on a paper airplane _ a
message the movie wisely never reveals _ he also inadvertently sets
her widowed mother up with his divorcing father, and Otto and Ana
wind up as infatuated stepsiblings, beginning their lifelong,
on-again, off-again love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Medem, who also wrote the screenplay, is so obsessed with the
cyclical nature of love and life that it even infuses his lead
characters' names (he's a bit heavy-handed in providing continual
reminders that both names are palindromic). Even the shapes of the
names _ the circles of Otto, the acute angles of Ana _ seem to be
intended to reflect the nature of the characters. Fele Martinez _
who's in another Spanish import opening this week, ``Open Your
Eyes'' _ has faraway eyes that are well-suited to Otto's drifting,
wounded soul; Najwa Nimri (also in ``Eyes'') has the sharp,
professional look of a woman who always knows where she's going.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point, ``Lovers'' is fascinating, largely because of
Medem's visual ideas (keenly realized by an empathetic
cinematographer, Gonzalo F. Berridi), and the movie's delicate
sense of humor. But Medem begins to play too many games with the
audience, ultimately taking his going-in-circles theme a little too
literally. After a while, the multiple coincidences, which the
screenplay admits are unlikely, cease to surprise, and the movie
drifts into predictability. It's unfortunate that such a
worthwhile, sensitively told fable didn't know when it was time to
quit.

CHRIS CONNOR/``WARM COOL: THE ATLANTIC YEARS'' (32 Jazz)!off!
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with June Christy and Julie London, Connor epitomized
``cool'' jazz singing in the '50s. This illuminating two-disc set
compiles tracks from the dozen albums the Anita O'Day-influenced
torch singer cut for Atlantic between 1956-62. The stuff is so
cool, you don't even notice when Connor has entered the picture on
such mellow standouts as ``Angel Eyes,'' ``Misty'' or ``Lilac
Wine.'' Top-notch arrangements by Don Sebesky and Ralph Sharon,
plus colorful backup from the likes of guitarist Freddie Greene,
pianist Jaki Byard and saxophonist Phil Woods maintain high
standards throughout 40 tunes, ranging from ``Strike Up the Band''
to an adventurous arrangement of Ornette Coleman's ``Lonely
Woman.'' 3 1/2 stars

DAVID SYLVIAN/``DEAD BEES ON A CAKE'' (Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1982 breakup of his first group, Japan, Sylvian has
made a series of ambitious musical moves that involved fascinating
collaborations and forays into filmmaking and modern art. Joining
up once again with composer Ryuichi Sakamoto for this superb new
effort, producer Sylvian sustains a consistent, sometimes dreamy
mood throughout. From the languorous beauty of album opener ``I
Surrender'' to the earthy, blues-inflected ``Midnight Sun,'' the
disc mixes rough and smooth in elegant fashion throughout 14
meticulously arranged tracks. Featured musicians include old
friends like Kenny Wheeler and Bill Frisell, along with avant-garde
guitarist Marc Ribot and Brit-Asian tabla player and producer
Talvin Singh. A gem. 4 stars

GUSGUS/``THIS IS NORMAL'' (4AD/Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Iceland's GusGus is an unpredictable nine-member multimedia
collective of singers, musicians, filmmakers, actors and others
specializing in dramatic, electro-tinged soundscapes utilizing
hypnotic rhythms along with pop, soul and techno elements. Thanks
to the group's three very different singers, each carefully crafted
track on its extravagantly pretty second album stands alone while
immediate highlights include the tender ``Bambi,'' the soul-deep
``Very Important People'' and the gorgeous ``Blue Mug,'' among
other brainy pieces. ``This Is Normal'' may be a lot of things, but
normal isn't one of them. 3 1/2 stars

DANNY GATTON/``HOT ROD GUITAR: THE DANNY GATTON ANTHOLOGY'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Gatton was the world's greatest unknown guitarist,
nicknamed the Humbler because of his awe-inspiring ability on his
battered '53 Fender Telecaster. Since 1994, though, he's been the
world's greatest unknown dead guitarist, the result of a suicide
just like his mentor, fellow Tele master Roy Buchanan six years
earlier. This 27-track, two-disc set does a good job tracing
Gatton's many moves, from sought-after, rough-and-tumble indie
efforts like ``Redneck Jazz'' and ``Relentless'' (with organist
Joey DeFrancesco) to the wonderful Blue Note jazz session ``New
York Stories'' (with Bobby Watson, Joshua Redman and Roy Hargrove)
and the two polished albums he cut for Elektra in the early '90s. 4

VARIOUS/``LIES, SISSIES AND FIASCOES: THE BEST OF THIS AMERICAN
LIFE'' (Rhino)!off!
</P>
<P>
   Ira Glass' ``This American Life'' is one of the best reasons to
listen to National Public Radio. The weekly program, always built
around a central theme and played out in four narrative acts, is an
inspired mixture of humor and pathos. Consisting of 11 monologues
on two CDs, this best-of culls some of the funniest and most
thought-provoking moments from the oddly touching show's three-year
history. Contributions come from Glass, author David Sedaris,
humorist Sandra Tsing Loh and a fellow known as Dishwater Pete
(whose mission is to wash dishes in all 50 states). In addition,
They Might Be Giants contribute a musical nugget. 3 1/2 stars

JIM HALL AND PAT METHENY/``JIM HALL &AMP; PAT METHENY'' (Telarc)!off!
</P>
<P>
   For their first collaboration, these guitarists' guitarists
split composing and arranging duties with each writing a handful of
blues and ballads while also covering such standards as
``Summertime'' and ``All the Things You Are.'' Nearly half the
tracks were recorded in concert, but there's surprisingly little
fire in these serene duets. Hall and Metheny are tasteful to a
fault throughout, soloing on such tracks as ``All Across the City''
and ``Cold Spring'' as if each was afraid of somehow offending the
other. Still, there are enough lovely moments to make this low-key
charmer worth your time. 3 stars

DOMINIQUE EADE/``THE LONG WAY HOME'' (RCA Victor)
</P>
<P>
   Jazz vocalist Eade continues to develop her warm, intimate way
with a song on this lovely album of songs about the road, the heart
and the home. Eade sings with an accomplished self-assurance on
four originals and eight covers that range from Henry Mancini's
``Two for the Road'' to Ornette Coleman's ``All My Life.'' Eade _
backed by pianist Bruce Barth, bassist Dave Holland, guitarist Mick
Goodrick and percussionist Cyro Baptista _ imbues each lyric with a
specific mood, demonstrating fine chops on a wide variety of songs.
A talent worth continued attention. 3 stars

MEL TORME/``LULU'S BACK IN TOWN'' (Avenue Jazz) &QL; 
HERBIE MANN AND SAM MOST/``THE HERBIE MANN-SAM MOST QUINTET''
(Avenue Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   off!
</P>
<P>
   The first two releases from the Bethlehem archives couldn't have
been better choices. ``Lulu's Back in Town'' (3 1/2 stars) has
Torme with Marty Paich's 10-piece band on a 1956 date that has
never been issued on CD. Torme's warm voice has rarely been
displayed to better effect, particularly on the title cut, a
delightful romp that became one of his most popular signature
songs. Also out for the first time on CD, the Mann-Most album (3
1/2 stars) pairs the two jazz flutists on an upbeat, lightly
swinging 1955 album that serves to underscore just how little this
cool instrument is used. It's an adventurous album that belongs in
any jazz library.

<P>
   Q: Several years ago, a millionaire went into an inner-city
sixth-grade class and offered to pay the college tuition of all
students in that class if they studied and qualified. How many of
the students went on to college?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.M., Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1981, Eugene Lang told 61 sixth-graders at P.S. 121 in
Harlem that he would send all of them to college if they finished
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that group, 90 percent graduated from high school or
received a GED, compared with an expected graduation rate of 25
percent. Sixty percent of the students went on to college or
vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, a retired millionaire who had attended the same school,
started the I Have a Dream Foundation in 1986 to keep other at-risk
children from dropping out. More than 150 projects similar to
Lang's have helped more than 10,000 students with support,
mentoring and tuition assistance.

ENGINEERS OFFER TWISTER PROTECTIONS THAT CAN BE COSTLY, OR
INEXPENSIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Engineering experts are looking to the Oklahoma catastrophe for
real-world lessons in what might help tornado-threatened Americans
survive the violent storms.
</P>
<P>
   Several engineers said that the fury and devastation of the
twisters that struck metro Oklahoma City could raise new questions,
and possibly provide answers, about how to build homes and other
structures in storm-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will be looking over the wreckage left by Monday
night's tornadoes to see what survived and why. Three engineering
teams from Texas Tech University in Lubbock are at the disaster
scene to begin an on-site survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about saving lives, of course,'' says Texas
Tech's Doug Smith, a structural engineer on the staff of Tech's
Wind Research Engineering Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``As engineers, we figure you save lives by keeping the
structure intact around the people inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula for keeping people safe from storm-blown debris,
falling roofs and walls, and toppling trees is both simple and
complex, say the experts:
</P>
<P>
   ``You put people inside some kind of enclosure that can't be
penetrated or collapsed or knocked around,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge is how to build that enclosure without
spending a small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you're willing to spend, the more you can protect
yourself,'' says Ben Sill, a fluid mechanics engineer at South
Carolina's Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
   That's the chief reason that commercial and institutional
buildings fare far better in storms than residential housing.
</P>
<P>
   The steel girders and reinforced concrete used for office
towers, hospitals and school buildings make them much less likely
to collapse, although flying debris and shattering glass still can
pose lethal hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Apartments and motels, often less strongly built, may not afford
the same level of protection. A lot depends on local building codes
and enforcement, says Bruce Russell, a structural engineer at the
University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Russell estimates that incorporating truly stormproof protection
into a new home could increase its construction cost by as much as
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of retrofitting an older home to make it safer would
run at least as much. For most people, that's not practical.
</P>
<P>
   Those building new homes can improve their odds of tornado
survival by designing a bathroom or utility room as an interior
shelter. The designated room should be built with reinforced
concrete-block walls and ceiling, solid-core doors with heavy
hardware, and firm anchoring to a slab foundation, Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   For older homes, the same principle applies, but instead of a
concrete block the plan substitutes multiple layers of heavy
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Covering walls and ceilings with three or four layers of
3/4-inch plywood provides almost as much protection,'' Smith says.
Again, heavy-duty doors and hardware, plus firm anchoring, are
essential.
</P>
<P>
   Sill says researchers at Clemson's Wind Load Test Facility have
concluded that adding just one layer of plywood sheathing to the
walls and ceiling of almost any room in a house affords a huge new
margin of safety.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the typical house, where walls are simply siding or brick
veneer on the outside and drywall on the inside, a falling tree or
pole can slice right through,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``By adding material to the wall, the risk is reduced. And the
stronger wall creates much greater protection against all but the
most direct-hitting debris.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson researchers are investigating the use of other
materials, including Kevlar and chain mesh, as wall reinforcement,
but neither is as cheap or convenient as ordinary plywood, Sill
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The engineers say that residents of the
Texas-Oklahoma-Kansas-Missouri ``Tornado Alley,'' as well as people
living along hurricane-threatened coasts, also should consider
other small steps that can deliver big safety benefits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foremost simple fixes is the addition of metal straps
for the roof rafters, wall studs and floor joists that comprise the
skeleton of virtually every U.S. home, new or old.
</P>
<P>
   The devices, known along the Gulf Coast as ``hurricane clips,''
tie together the joints between 2-by-4s, 2-by-6s and 2-by-8s that
otherwise are likely held together only by nails.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We put clips on our house when we built it,'' says Russell,
whose Norman, Okla., campus is just minutes from the tornado
disaster area. ``It wasn't expensive. You can buy these things by
the box at Home Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   The same low-tech, do-it-yourself approach can be applied to
mobile homes, which must be securely anchored and fully skirted to
prevent strong winds from sending them tumbling to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep the structure in one place,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three engineers concede that all bets are off for tornadoes
as powerful as the ones in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Russell says most commercial buildings are engineered to
withstand winds of 100 to 130 mph. Some homes will stand up to such
winds, but many cannot. Most mobile homes are vulnerable at winds
half that speed.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the fiercest of the several funnels that raked
Oklahoma City was rated F-5 on the Fujita scale, which implies wind
speeds in excess of 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineering for that,'' Sill says, ``is not possible.`` &QL;

NEW TV VIEWING TECHNOLOGY IS LOADED WITH KINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Making the idiot box idiot-proof. That seems to
be the theory behind two new TV set-top boxes that hit the market
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Personal Video Recorders, or PVRs, the gizmos are being
touted as the next wave in television viewing, allowing users to
create their own instant replays, commercial-free network viewing
experience and effortless recording of shows for later watching.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have a burning desire to pay top dollar for
less-than-perfect technology that is certain to cost half as much
in the next year or so, you may want to pass up this new wave of
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two PVRs are on the market: TiVo, which is made by
TiVo Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and ReplayTV, manufactured by
Replay Networks, a new company in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both have similar core technologies: Massive hard drives
constantly record and play back TV signals streamed in from just
about anything that can capture a TV signal _ satellite, cable or
rabbit ears.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes, both of which resemble faceless VCRs, squeeze the
received TV signal down to a manageable size by way of an MP2 video
processing chip.
</P>
<P>
   A user, via remote control, then manipulates this disk-stored
information by way of built-in software.
</P>
<P>
   Both machines require a phone connection to download updated
listings and other information into the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Because the boxes are constantly recording, you can pause,
rewind and play back any show you're watching. This immediately
translates into a network's worst nightmare: You can start, say,
``Frasier'' at 7 p.m. and then take a 10-minute food break. When
you return to the couch, you can rewind and start watching the show
from its beginning, skipping commercials along the way. By the time
you get to 7:30, you've caught up with the actual real-time TV
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   This also means you can instantly create your own instant
replays.
</P>
<P>
   This technology is not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo starts at $499 for 14-hour storage capacity, and climbs to
$999 for a 30-hour machine. A 10-hour ReplayTV costs $699, and the
28-hour machine goes for $1,499. These prices don't include
shipping (the devices are available only by mail order from Web
sites).
</P>
<P>
   But TiVo isn't really a price leader. The company also charges
for its interactive, on-screen guide. That can add $200 or more to
the cost of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   While the core technology for both machines is similar, there
are several user features that distinguish the two.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo edged out ReplayTV in set-up simplicity, though both
machines could use another revision or two to make this process
easier. A dizzying array of connecting cords is included with each
machine. Installation involves having to figure out exactly how
you're going to control the PVR and its relationship to any other
video component, like a DVD player or second VCR. Satellite users
have to install included widgets that will link the PVR to the disk
set-top receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ReplayTV fell down in its out-of-the-box experience.
</P>
<P>
   Paltry documentation made for difficult going. And cords were
way too short, requiring two trips to Radio Shack. TiVo included
the right length cords and a video that explained the basic
installation clearly.
</P>
<P>
   There was one glitch in ReplayTV's installation: If you set up
its PVR to also handle a VCR or DVD player, a tiny hiccup in the
picture will occasionally occur (about two to three times per
feature film). Apparently, the signal from these components ``backs
up'' the signal in the MP2 processor. It's a tiny but annoying bug.
</P>
<P>
   But ReplayTV excelled when it came to the interactive TV guide.
ReplayTV's guide lets you see several hours ahead over a range of
channels, much like a standard print TV guide.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo's guides contained lush graphics, but the listings were
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Recording future shows was also a ReplayTV strength. You
highlight a show on the viewing guide, hit record, answer a couple
of quick questions. A small red ball on the TV guide shows you that
you've chosen the show for later recording. TiVo makes you work
through a few screens and lots of unnecessary choices to record
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV also has a better remote control. It doubles as a
universal remote that lets you manipulate DVD or other components.
TiVo's remote will let you control the volume and power for a TV or
audio amplifier. And it doesn't do that very well. The code that
turns on my amplifier shut off my TV.
</P>
<P>
   Another ReplayTV plus: The box contains a ``firewire''
connection that will allow disk drive expansion in the future. TiVo
has no such capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But TiVo's biggest downfall is the pricing policy of the
company's interactive guide.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo charges $9.99 per month to download the listings necessary
to use its PVR. (A lifetime guide fee of $199 is available, as is a
$99 annual payment plan.) ReplayTV doesn't charge for this service.
</P>
<P>
   The TiVo machine tracks your PVR usage, and uploads those stats
to TiVo's computers. This means you become the target of PVR junk
mail in the form of on-screen ads, some of it based on your
watching habits. And you get to pay for the privilege. It's a
cheapskate strategy that deserves to fail.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, PVRs are impressive. It's technology that does
enhance the TV watching experience. But considering its pricing and
flaws, it's probably best to wait this one out. Cheaper, slicker
machines probably aren't too far away.

WORMS MAKE PERFECT PETS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever since my neighbors gave me a compost bin as
a housewarming present, I have sarcastically referred to it as ``my

and am no closer than I ever was to acquiring a dog, cat, bird or
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Demeece and Sally, the neighbors who gave me the compost bin,
have a dog, a cat and a major composter that makes their backyard
soil ultra-rich. When they brought over my bin _ a green plastic
cooler-like thing with holes in the bottom _ they included simple
guidelines and a list of acceptable and verboten ``food'' for the
worms. (Coffee grounds and filters are OK; lamb chops and cheese
aren't.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first few weeks I was, if not enthusiastic, at least
game. Per Demeece and Sally's instructions I separated the good
garbage from the nasty animal products, cut big chunks into smaller
pieces, stirred them into the fecund-smelling compost and kept a
soggy piece of newspaper over the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring isn't easy, by the way. Compost is dense and tends to
clump. Probably I should use one of those three-pronged claw things
that you dig dirt with, but I started with a wooden spoon so I keep
using a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   When winter came, I thought a lot about going outside, prying
off the compost bin lid and stirring the garbage. But it always
seemed to be pouring rain or freezing. So, I kept chucking all my
garbage into my garbage can and promising myself I'd feed ``my
pets'' in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Months passed. At least three. I felt guilty about neglecting
the worms. But I didn't do anything. Then I went into denial,
refused to look at the bin, even when I was weeding or planting in
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a few days ago, I cracked. Maybe it was because I'd
spent a long weekend in Las Vegas where it is prohibited by law for
humans to be in harmony with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting a bin full of starved-to-death worm corpses, I pried
off the lid. All was not quiet on the compost front: The soggy
newspaper looked like a piece of gray-black lace; the worms et al
had chewed zillions of little holes in it. And it was pulsating
from underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Using my wooden spoon to pull aside the paper (no way I was
going to touch it with my bare hands), I peered into a roiling sea
of gigantic pink worms, those silvery-and-black oval bugs that
scurry when you pick up a potted plant, teeny white squirmy
lightning bolt things and I don't know what else.
</P>
<P>
   My compost bin looked like a big bowl of living spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing for some cannibalism, which I hear compost dwellers
practice, I could only conclude that the worms et al had survived
off the soggy newspaper. Not just survived, THRIVED.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in ages I felt good about what I do for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   I also had to admit that Demeece and Sally not only have
improved my backyard soil, they really did find the perfect pets
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Worms are quiet. They don't shed or cough up fur balls and they
exercise themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other house pets, they chew on one another, not on
furniture or shoes. They don't need a litter box either because
they live in one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps best of all, when times are lean and food is scarce,
worms can subsist on the one thing I'll always have plenty of _
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's time for names.

   BRONX-ARTS (New York) _ Art in the Bronx, like the sprawling
borough itself, is a resilient multi-facetted thing, cosmopolitan

media, from video installation to virtuosic aerosal spray painting.
And it turns up in unexpected places: in school hallways, hospital
lobbies, courtrooms, subway stations, apartment living rooms, and _
officially, unofficially, and often heart-liftingly _ on building
facades. By Holland Cotter.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A week after the Colorado high-school massacre, President
Clinton proposed new gun control legislation and asked Americans to
rethink the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep working until people start thinking about
this stuff the same way they think about X-rays and metal detectors
at airports,'' he declared at a White House ceremony. ``We have to
redefine the national community so that we have a shared obligation
to save children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   To the gun control advocates in attendance, Clinton pleaded,
``You change the culture, we'll change the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech was a textbook illustration of how to use a
national trauma to reframe an issue. Congress has opposed gun
control for years. By changing the ``culture'' -- i.e., the way
voters ``think about'' firearms -- Clinton hopes to swing public
opinion in favor of gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he observed, rural Americans have thought of guns
in terms of hunting and the right to bear arms. In the future,
Clinton wants Americans to think of guns in new terms: bombs and
kids. His strategy is threefold.
</P>
<P>
   1. Co-opt the ``culture'' argument. Opponents of gun control
have framed the debate as a choice between blaming weapons and
blaming people who abuse them. ``Guns don't kill people; people
kill people,'' goes the famous slogan. Since conservatives tend to
oppose pornography and divorce as well as gun control, they get a
twofer by attributing tragedies such as the one in Colorado to a
degenerating ``culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans put out the word that House Speaker Dennis Hastert
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott were going to kick off a
``national dialogue on youth and culture'' to address
nongun-related causes of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to neutralize the importance of culture by
acknowledging it. In her opening remarks, Hillary Clinton invoked
prayer and religion and repeatedly charged that the ``culture of
violence'' in television, movies, music, video games, and the
Internet ``is having a profound effect on our children'' and
``causes more aggression and anti-social behavior.'' ``We must
resolve to do what we can to change that culture,'' she proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons claimed that several of their pet causes and
projects were ameliorating anti-social conduct: V-chips, children's
television, Internet filters, and mental health awareness. By
suggesting that the cultural causes of violence were being
sufficiently addressed, they sought to shift attention and pressure
to the remaining factor: guns.
</P>
<P>
   2. Focus on kids. Adults who can't stand the idea of the
government telling them what to do are usually willing and often
eager to have the government impose identical restrictions on
teen-agers. So the Clintons aimed their legislation and rhetoric at
kids and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns and children are two words that should never be put
together in the same sentence,'' argued Hillary Clinton, who
managed to squeeze off countless criticisms of guns in between her
eight invocations of ``our children.'' President Clinton repeatedly
drew applause as he announced proposals to ``raise the legal age of
handgun possession from 18 to 21 years'' and ``prevent juveniles
who commit violent crimes from ever buying a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Equate guns with bombs. Americans love rights and recreation
but hate crime and mayhem. The most important element of Clinton's
strategy, therefore, is to get the public to stop associating guns
with hunting and self-protection and to start associating them with
explosives and terrorism instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge hunting and sport-shooting culture in
America,'' Clinton observed. But ``I want to make a plea to
everybody who is waiting for the next deer season in my home state
to think about this in terms of what our reasonable obligations to
the larger community of America are. ... Next time you get on an
airplane, think about how you'd feel if the headline in the morning
paper right before you got on the airplane was 'Airport Metal
Detectors and X-Ray Machines Abolished as Infringement on
Americans' Constitutional Right To Travel.' ... And right next to
it there is another headline: 'Terrorist Groups Expanding
Operations in the United States.'''
</P>
<P>
   To fortify this unorthodox analogy, the Clintons bound guns and
bombs together in their legislation and in their analysis on the
Colorado tragedy. While Hillary Clinton preached against juvenile
access to ``bomb-making materiel'' and decried ``the arsenal of
guns, rifles, and bombs that the two young men in Littleton were
able to bring into their school,'' President Clinton earned another
ovation by proposing to ``require Brady background checks on anyone
who wants to buy explosives.''
</P>
<P>
   If opponents of gun control don't recognize soon how the
emerging prominence of kids and explosives is transforming the
nation's image of deadly weapons, Clinton may succeed in reshaping
the debate and turning the political tide against guns. Advocates
of gun rights say Clinton is ``exploiting this tragedy in Littleton
to further his gun control agenda.'' Of course he is. They're
missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians don't ban guns. Politicians with persuasive
arguments ban guns.

   One of the basic principles of economics is that if a $20 bill
is lying on the ground, someone is going to pick it up pretty
quickly. In other words, with so many people out there trying to
make money, very few -- if any -- profit-making opportunities will
be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the fact that someone will recognize a good
business idea for what it is doesn't necessarily mean that everyone
will.
</P>
<P>
   And oddly, it sometimes seems that the people who are least
likely to recognize the value of a new idea are the very ones who
will be hurt the most when it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Take Toys R Us, whose stock got a little boost recently from the
announcement that it would be creating a new distinct Internet
sales unit.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us has been selling toys over the Net for almost a year
(http://www.toysrus.com), but it has been unable to translate its
strong brand recognition in the bricks-and-mortar world into
strength on the Internet. Its sales still trail those of eToys,
which is an Internet-only operation (http://www.etoys.com), and it
hasn't shown any commitment at all to the Net portion of its
business.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, Toys R Us has been blinkered by its size
and its investment in ``real'' stores.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of books and CDs, it's hard to think of
anything that's easier to sell over the Net than toys, which are
prepackaged goods generally purchased by adults who are getting
very clear instructions about exactly what they're supposed to buy.
</P>
<P>
   To generalize wildly, toy stores aren't really about browsing.
So it makes sense that toys would translate well to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us realized this enough to start selling on the Internet,
but didn't realize it enough to set up the Net business as a
separate unit. Even stranger is how half-hearted the Toys R Us site
seems.
</P>
<P>
   You go to eToys, and it's relatively easy to find what you want,
and when you find it, it's very easy to order. But at the Toys R Us
site, you can quickly get locked into a procession of screens that
seem designed to make actually buying harder, not easier.
</P>
<P>
   The site is now being redesigned, but the real question is: What
took you so long? All you have to do is check out the eToys site to
realize that its presentation is better, in the sense that it's
simpler and more conducive to buying. So what kept Toys R Us from
seeing that?
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of barnesandnoble.com
(http://barnesandnoble.com) -- which can now also be found at
bn.com -- and borders.com (http://www.borders.com) in comparison
with Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com) deserves its
lofty valuation -- though with every new shipment of books I order
from it, I become less skeptical -- but there's no question that
shopping there is a breeze. It's not the prettiest site, I guess,
but everything is where it should be. And its account service is
excellent. You can check on the progress of your order and make
changes with ease.
</P>
<P>
   At barnesandnoble.com, by contrast, you can't actually check on
your order on the Net. You have to call an operator to do that. I
have no idea why this should be the case. The technological hurdles
hardly seem too high. And the value to a customer of having
complete online access to her account seems indubitable. So what's
been keeping B&AMP;N from just copying Amazon?
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a good answer to any of these questions. But I do
wonder if the word ``copying'' isn't part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, emulation is not the best route to profitability. You
have to differentiate yourself from your competitors to create a
real competitive advantage. So it's possible that mimicking a
competitor's successes seems like a poor strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But let's state the obvious: Differentiation works only if
you're different in a better way.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Jaguar was different from other luxury cars,
because it broke down a lot more and was a lot harder to service.
That didn't earn it more customers. And making Jaguars more
reliable wasn't a concession to competitors. It was just a matter
of coming to terms with reality.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, it's hard to see why companies like Toys R Us
and Barnes &AMP; Noble haven't just visited their competitors' Web
sites, said, ``This works, this works, and this works. Let's copy
them exactly,'' and then used their brand names to win market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they really would rather leave those $20 bills lying
there.

WHAT'S BEHIND THE BRADLEY SURGE AND GORE STUMBLE? NOT MUCH

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is a season of refusal in American politics. The Clinton
scandals, exhausted, refuse to revive themselves. Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, anointed, refuses to campaign for president till summer
arrives. Congress, terrified of Social Security, refuses to do
anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, too, abhors a vacuum, so Washington has concocted a
story to fill the void: Bill Bradley, whose presidential campaign
was written off just months ago, is surging, and Vice President Al
Gore, the nominee presumptive, is in deep trouble. No matter that
the New Hampshire primary is 10 months away.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
The Chicago Tribune, many smaller papers, and all three
newsweeklies have touted the viability of Bradley's campaign and
the messiness of Gore's. The great sage David Broder recently
declared that Gore was struggling and conferred the mantle of
electability on Bradley. Bradley's numbers seem to be rising in the
polls: One showed Bradley trailing Gore by only 17 points among
Democratic voters. (Other, more recent polls show Bradley trailing
Gore by a larger margin.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is an impressive candidate, blessed with celebrity,
thoughtfulness and a good heart, and Gore can be an erratic
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradley Surge and Gore Stumble have little to do with
the candidates. We are witnessing one of the first fake battles of
what the Progressive Policy Institute's Will Marshall calls ``the
phony war'' of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This is the period when voters are indifferent, and when
journalists, Democratic candidates, and Republican troublemakers
spin and position and jockey to write the script for the coming
real campaign -- in this case, a script that makes Bradley a white
knight and Gore a looming disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason for the Bradley Surge is that Dollar Bill is
proving himself a better fund-raiser than anyone expected. He
collected $4.3 million in the first three months of the year, less
than half what Gore raised, but more than enough to make him a
legitimate candidate. His first fund-raising reports two weeks ago
gave journalists an opening to laud him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley surge also owes something to his fame. Bradley is
the John McCain of the left, the politician who turns baby boomer
men weak in the knees. His ``Princeton, basketball,
sense-of-where-you-are, Rhodes Scholar, New York Knick'' mystique
won him a free pass as the thinking man's senator. This was only
reinforced by his celebrated reluctance to run for president in
1988 and 1992 and his ``politics is broken'' retirement speech in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as the politician too good for politics has been
a key feature of the early adulatory campaign coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important reasons for Bradley's supposed surge are
independent of the candidate. Bradley has lucked into a one-on-one
race. Besides serving as yet another useful basketball metaphor for
Bradley -- ``I'm going one-on-one with Al Gore'' -- the two-man
race gives Bradley instant viability. He's automatically one gaffe
away from the nomination. Political Washington is desperate for a
Democratic horse race, but a horse race can only happen if Bradley
is perceived to be strong, and he will only be perceived to be
strong if everyone says he is.
</P>
<P>
   The one-on-one campaign also explains Bradley's apparent rise in
the polls. As the only challenger, Bradley collects all the
anti-Gore votes. Bradley's numbers have climbed as pollsters
dropped Richard Gephardt, Paul Wellstone, and Jesse Jackson from
their surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's media boomlet also depends on Democratic anxiety about
Gore. Gore trails both George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole in
nationwide polls. More than 50 percent of one poll sample called
Gore ``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has become a kind of voodoo doll for Clinton: When the
president is in trouble, his approval ratings remain high, but
Gore's numbers sag. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that
the vast majority of Americans are sick of the Clinton
administration scandals, and they are taking out their frustration
on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans want someone who continues Clinton's policies and
programs but who is not Clinton. Gore ought to fit that bill,''
says Pew Director Andrew Kohut. ``But somehow there is a link
between Clinton and Gore that is hurting Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats feeling panicky over the Gore numbers are touting
Bradley as the remedy: Every piece on Bradley emphasizes that he
shares Gore's moderate, thoughtful, New Democrat politics but isn't
handcuffed to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are doing their best to intensify this Democratic
anxiety about the vice president. They are trying to Quaylize Gore.
Republican house members, Republican senators, the Republican
National Committee, and Republican interest groups have been
assaulting Gore for the past few months, trying to turn him into a
figure of fun. They have ridiculed his ``creating the Internet''
comment, his claim that he and Tipper were the model for ``Love
Story,'' and his anecdotes about growing up as a farm boy.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Bradley is rising and Gore is falling can become
true if everyone keeps declaring it so. But what's more likely is
that time and the natural course of campaigns will take their toll.
Campaigns are self-correcting: If Bradley gets close enough to be a
real challenge to Gore, he will be subject to the same withering
fire that Gore faces. It will be pointed out again and again that
Bradley is just as awkward a campaigner as Gore. Bradley, who has
belittled Gore's microproposals (sprawl, traffic, etc.), will see
his own self-proclaimed ``big ideas'' questioned.
</P>
<P>
   As the plucky challenger, Bradley can campaign both to the left
and right of Gore, picking up support from anti-Gore, pro-labor
activists on one day and boosting his pro-business, pro-free-trade
agenda to Wall Streeters a few days later. But if his campaign
really prospers and he has to explain what he believes, he'll have
a hard time holding that coalition together. At the moment, Bradley
can promote his support for campaign finance reform, but if he does
well, he'll be battered with questions about his own aggressive
fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The progression of the campaign will also rescue Gore from his
Vice Presidential Malaise. The Democratic fretfulness about Gore's
polls is premature: Vice presidents always poll terribly in the
year before their presidential campaign. George Bush, you may
remember, trailed Gary Hart in 1987 polls, and Newsweek even ran a
cover story about Bush and ``the wimp factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been Clinton's lackey for more than six years. He's
loyal to his president, and that loyalty makes him look
ineffectual. (George W. Bush kills Gore in poll questions about
``leadership.'' Bush is the manly governor of Texas, while Gore
moderates Reinventing Government seminars.)
</P>
<P>
   The cure for the phony war will be the real one. Come fall and
winter, surges and stumbles will really mean something. By then
Gore will be campaigning seriously, distancing himself from
Clinton, and running macho ads; Bradley will have defined his big
ideas and endured the inevitable media backlash to his current rave
notices; and the voters will actually be paying attention.

FROM RAILS TO CABLES, LANDMARK PREPARES FOR NEW CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was like watching a ship being built in a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of One Market, just a few yards from diners in
the elegant restaurant of the same name, a 125,000-pound drill rig
was being assembled.
</P>
<P>
   How do you assemble a drill rig inside a 10-story building? With
a very big crane to lift the parts inside.
</P>
<P>
   Why do it? Because One Market is a big piece of San Francisco
history, built in 1917 by Southern Pacific Railroad as its
headquarters. The idea is to gingerly lift heavy equipment inside
the building to shore it up and save its exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could just knock it down. You also could live in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Martin Group, renovators of the office building, should see
its $100 million investment in the best address in San Francisco
pay off handsomely. They hope to attract tenants from the booming
high-tech and financial industries. No one can predict how the
economy will go, but the view isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a narrow air shaft in the middle of the building, the 70-foot
tower of the drill rig was being put together like a giant fishing
rod _ if you can imagine putting together a 62-ton rod in an
enclosed, closetlike space.
</P>
<P>
   The giant crane on the roof 10 stories above held one length of
the drill, while a worker in the basement talked to the crane
operator by radio. They couldn't even see each other, and they were
assembling a drill rig capable of mining coal inside a historic San
Francisco building.
</P>
<P>
   The rig will drill 165 feet down, through the Bay fill and deep
into the clay soil to place steel-reinforced concrete piers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a big piece of equipment in a confined space, a big
crane on the roof and only one entrance in the back,'' said Bob
Tigri, site manager for Plant Construction Co. ``We're on the
cutting edge of construction, and the public never sees us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, from the sidewalk you'd never know anything is
happening inside One Market other than lunch and office work.
</P>
<P>
   Passersby didn't even look at flatbed trucks bearing
3-foot-diameter drill bits and screws.
</P>
<P>
   To most people, they're just a few more flatbed trucks on the
streets, the kind of trucks that lead people to curse downtown
development. But this is a special kind of development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a glass box,'' said development manager Matt Field
of the Martin Group. ``We want to create something unique. San
Francisco deserves something unique.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what they're building is a permanent concrete box 10
stories tall in the core of the building to brace it without
interfering with the office space, windows or the beautiful
exterior masonry.
</P>
<P>
   Field, 36, the son of respected San Francisco architect John
Field, also worked on the preservation and renovation of 1000 Van
Ness for the Martin Group and obviously loves old San Francisco
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1917, when SP built One Market, it was really the
state-of-the-art building,'' Field said. ``At 10 stories, it was
the tallest building west of the Mississippi. It had the first
sprinkler system. It was the tallest of the palazzo style. This was
just the beginning of steel-reinforced buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad sank 2,000 redwood trunks into the Earth to anchor
the building in the Bay mud. The building came through the '89
quake with flying colors, and only a few flying pieces of cornice.
</P>
<P>
   The redwood will stay, even with the new and deeper
steel-and-concrete piers. So goes the old with the new at One
Market.
</P>
<P>
   The building originally was supposed to be a rail terminus, and
Southern Pacific put in a diesel generator that is still capable of
providing power to the building for four days. Railroads were at
their zenith in 1917, and they built things to last.
</P>
<P>
   The building is being rebuilt for the new technology, with fiber
optics, high-speed access cables, T-3, FM-based communication on
the roof, and everything else I don't understand _ plus plenty of
capacity for cables that haven't been invented yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it has everything we've built for our tenants in
Silicon Valley,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   As we stood in gutted offices overlooking the Ferry Building,
Field explained the strategy for marketing his building's 350,000
square feet of office space. He didn't have to explain much.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing was right out the windows, which will open to the
fresh air, unlike the windows of the glass boxes of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The developers also will open some windows that Southern Pacific
blocked with concrete in the '60s as protection against possible
attack by the Weather Underground.
</P>
<P>
   The building also offers high ceilings, brass-and-wood banisters
and carved wood finishings that the glass boxes don't have. You get
the idea. One Market is a way for high-tech nerds to go upscale and
get up the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech business is very employee-driven,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s, the baby boomers wanted to live in the suburbs.
The Gen-Xers want an urban environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Field says he's getting tenants of all kinds, not just
high-tech. ``It's a confluence of all the great things happening in
the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better corner anywhere in the world. SP
could have chosen anyplace in California to put their headquarters,
and they chose that location. It's only gotten better.''

ZOOMING IN ON SHOPPERS: RESEARCH FIRM STUDIES PEOPLE'S PURCHASING
HABITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Teresa McUsic 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Paco Underhill says he has shopping down to a science, he
isn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The urban geographer and retail anthropologist _ I am not making
up these titles _ is also founder of a research and consulting firm
called Envirosell, which advises Fortune 100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill's analysis of how we shop may revolutionize the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about daily sales tapes totals. As Underhill
and Bill Gates tell us, most of the information gathered by cash
register codes isn't even used to make in-store changes to increase
sales.
</P>
<P>
   We also aren't talking about market research, which typically
polls people who may or may not remember their last shopping
experience. Underhill says that people often remember seeing
products that aren't even in the store, or they forget the brand of
something they just bought.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly numbers on which you want to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Underhill has spent the past 20 years developing
something he calls the science of shopping. He uses video cameras
and discreet observers to record the buying habits of shoppers. His
employees can calculate how many ties you touch before you decide
to buy one, or how many shoppers will come and go without buying
anything.
</P>
<P>
   He has made fascinating observations about shoppers and stores
by watching and recording up to 900 aspects of shopper-store
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Forget branding, traditional advertising and the other standard
marketing tools.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Most buying decisions are made on the sales floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important medium for transmitting messages and closing
sales is now the store and the aisle,'' Underhill says. ``That
building, that place, has become a great big three-dimensional
advertisement for itself. Signage, shelf position, display space
and special fixtures all make it either likelier or less likely
that a shopper will buy a particular item'' (or any item at all.)
</P>
<P>
   If that store is a comfortable environment, shoppers will stay
longer, Underhill tells us. And if they stay longer, they buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Those refreshing ideas can be found in Underhill's new book,
``Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 255
pages).
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about this book is that it focuses
strictly on one unit of a store _ any store. Therefore, the
information and observations can be applied to a giant chain such
as Nordstrom's or Wal-Mart, or a tiny individual boutique.
</P>
<P>
   And in this day of heavy competition, such advice could give a
retailer the edge needed to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now dangerously overretailed _ too much is for sale,
through too many outlets,'' Underhill writes. ``... Retailers are
not opening stores in the United States to serve new markets
anymore. They are opening stores to try to steal someone else's
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the traditional marketing tools, Underhill has
his own tools, which he discusses extensively. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _''How to design signs that shoppers will actually read and how
to make sure each message is in the appropriate place.''
</P>
<P>
   _''How to fashion displays that shoppers can examine comfortable
and easily.''
</P>
<P>
   _''How to ensure that shoppers can reach, and want to reach,
every part of a store.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas are brought into reality by scientifically
researched equations such as the conversion rate (the number of
shoppers who become buyers); the interception rate (the percentage
of customers who have some contact with an employee); and the
waiting time before checkout.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill uses numerous examples, usually without naming names,
to illustrate his points. He shows how a drugstore moved its
aspirin out of the path of teen-agers heading for soft drinks;
sales of aspirin to its main buyer, senior citizens, rose 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Or how moving a tie rack near Bloomingdale's front door, where
shoppers were being bumped into by entering and exiting customers,
created a substantial and quick rise in sales.
</P>
<P>
   This book provides an excellent way for retailers to examine
their tore space and look for what may drawing customers, as well
as what may be causing them to leave without buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overarching lesson that we've learned from the science of
shopping is this: Amenability and profitability are totally and
inextricably linked,'' Underhill writes. ``... Build and operate a
retail environment that fits the highly particular needs of
shoppers and you've created a successful store.''

all learned more about temporary employment. This guide covers such
topics as how much to charge, how to market and sell your services,
and how to work with agencies.

A REFUGEE WEB WIZARD DAZZLES IN A NEW LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania -- Three weeks ago, Vigan Budima was just
another young refugee, one of the thousands of anonymous faces seen
fleeing desperately from Kosovo. But in the days since, he has
become something else: the top Web page designer at Albania Online,
the biggest Internet company in the capital, his temporary
hometown. Budima, 18, arrived here with his parents after a
four-day journey through Montenegro with only packets of food and
the clothes on his back. He had no idea what had become of his
brother, Valon.
</P>
<P>
   So, as thousands of refugees waited in long lines for a
telephone, Budima knocked on the door of an Internet provider he
saw listed in the newspaper and asked if he could send his brother
an e-mail. Within hours, he had persuaded the owners of Albania
Online to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me. I don't have anything else to do,'' Budima
said, fiddling with a computer mouse and demonstrating his latest
designs from what has become his private office. ``Also, this is a
poor country. This Internet is new for them. There's not much
home-page development here.'' His good fortune is one extraordinary
story in a country where hundreds of thousands of Kosovars spend
their days in cramped refugee camps, and hundreds have no shelter
at all. But his ambition is strikingly common among his peers, many
of whom have sought jobs or volunteer work since arriving in
Albania in an effort to hold on to a fragment of normal life.
</P>
<P>
   In hotels and restaurants in Tirana, as well as in humanitarian
organizations in northern Albania, Kosovars are seeping into the
fabric of the country, with engineers working as English
translators and teachers working as office assistants. Some have
even managed to get jobs in their own field, like the doctors now
working with humanitarian health teams.
</P>
<P>
   Their motive clearly is not economic; few Albanian companies can
afford to pay refugees for work, and any wages are far below what
professionals earned in Kosovo. Instead, many refugees seemed to be
emerging from a state of shock into one of boredom, leaving them
anxious to re-create pieces of their former lives.
</P>
<P>
   They are frustrated by the length of time that has passed since
they left Kosovo. Although they hope to return home in a matter of
weeks, many say they are looking for things to do in the meantime
-- particularly if it means helping other refugees. ``You've got to
remember: These aren't peasants. Kosovo is not in the Stone Age,''
said Rick Grant, an official of CARE International. ``These are
educated, cultivated people, and it's natural for people who are
successful in their homelands to want to show some initiative, even
in this kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Grant said, ``Nothing is worse than to sit in a refugee
camp, day after day after day. It's like being in a penitentiary.
There's absolutely nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdet Nila can attest to that. After traveling into Albania
from his hometown of Pec, Nila, 35, said he spent a week in a
Tirana refugee camp, wandering all day between rows of tents. When
the owner of a nearby hotel offered to shelter Nila and his family
for a few days, he accepted, but only after insisting on
volunteering as a translator at the hotel's front desk. He soon
realized he was the only employee who could speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the owner, no pay is fine,'' said Nila, who ran a
family paint business in Kosovo and who now stays with his wife,
parents, and three children in room 42 of the Hotel Balkani. ``In
the camp, all the time I was saying, `I need work to spend my time.
I don't want to just walk around and smoke cigarettes.' `` Urban
Kosovars appear to be the most restless -- and the most useful to
Albanian and foreign companies -- because many worked at office
jobs in cities such as Pristina and Prizren and learned to speak
more than one European language. In that sense, they are more
employable than many Albanian natives, whose formal education
sometimes stops at the eighth grade. The sudden emergence of
refugees in the work force is a welcome sign to humanitarian
officials, who say it creates a kind of welfare-to-work atmosphere
in a system otherwise built on communist-era dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians ``obviously know the language, know the
culture, know the needs,'' said Rick Brennan, director of health
for the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based medical
team that has hired refugees in Macedonia and Albania. ``It allows
them to maintain their skills and their dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   At Albania Online, the symbols of Budima's gratitude are
emblazoned on his computer screen. He has created five home pages
in the past two weeks -- including ones for the Albanian Democratic
Party and for the country's largest radio station. He learned his
skills after school on an outdated computer in his parents' home.
But he was a pro even in high school: When his brother Valon, 27,
opened an Internet-provider firm in Pristina, Budima became a
long-distance employee, designing sites and communicating by modem
from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   His brother's company, Pro.net, shut down last month after the
NATO airstrikes began. Valon left a few days later. Budima and his
parents, both teachers, left their apartment March 28.
</P>
<P>
   After driving first to Montenegro, they decided to go on to
Albania, in the hopes that distant relatives might take them in.
When Budima got here, he thought that he might be able to reach
Valon by e-mail. ``I came here and asked if I can use the computer
for just half an hour,'' he said from the office of Albania Online.
``Then I showed them some home pages I'd done. They were
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out a deal: $30 per home page and access to the
Internet. But several days later, he got an even greater reward.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail came back from Valon. He said he had fled south from
Pristina toward Macedonia, spending six horrific days trapped near
the border before being allowed to enter a refugee camp. After
making it to safety, Valon had the same inspiration as his younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   He sought out an Internet cafe. And there, from hundreds of
miles away, he let his family know he had survived.

 &HT;    Prepare for heat, wind if your container garden is to reach new
heights
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next time you notice one of those lush little
gardens spilling over a high-rise balcony, give its gardener a big
salute.
</P>
<P>
   The owner deserves it. Any successful container gardener knows
there's a science to what goes into making a pretty pot. Choosing
the wrong type of container, soil or plants can send the garden
into terra-cotta terror. But balcony containers face even bigger
obstacles _ exposure to the extremes that come with height.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat in summer and winds year-round can have a devastating
effect on plants,'' said Jeremy Smearman, owner of Planters, a
Buckhead garden center.
</P>
<P>
   Having created containers for balconies as high as 40 floors,
including part-time Atlantan Elton John's condo in Park Place, the
garden designer has seen large, plant-filled terra-cotta pots
topple onto their sides from the force of howling winds.
</P>
<P>
   Heat, especially if the porch faces south or southwest, is
another battle. Even under normal conditions, container gardens
often require daily watering because plant roots not only are
confined but are within a pot that retains heat. Place those
containers on a skyscraper's pedestal for several hours of baking
in Atlanta's summer sun, and the survival stakes run higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a problem for a lot of our clients,'' said Randy
Korando of Boxwoods Gardens &AMP; Gifts in Atlanta, which designs
container gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But by making careful choices in plants and materials, high-rise
dwellers can create a small-scale garden of their dreams. The key,
in addition to planning for exposure, is to aim for a few large
containers instead of a dozen small ones, for both aesthetic and
practical reasons. Clustering a few pots together creates not only
a focal point for the balcony but more mass for withstanding winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to soften the harsh look of a balcony, you want
to use plants with some size and substance to them and also so the
wind won't topple them,'' Smearman said.
</P>
<P>
   Small trees and shrubs make ideal centerpieces for pots,
especially when their trunks are trimmed up so that the container
can be underplanted with smaller plants for color. (And don't worry
about the weight of large soil-packed cement containers, Smearman
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other factors to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Containers. Fiberglass, designed to resemble clay pots, once
was shunned as a cheap imitation, but recent advances have made the
plastic material more attractive. It's also popular because it's
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   But for high-rise gardening, weight is desirable. Smearman
prefers terra cotta, but because it's prone to breakage, especially
during freezes, he uses concrete. His favorite containers are
Haddonstone, which contain limestone and resist cracking.
</P>
<P>
   From a design perspective, he uses pots that complement the
building's exterior _ and often the unit's interior design.
</P>
<P>
   Because concrete and terra cotta are porous, pots made of those
materials dry out more rapidly than fiberglass, said Mildred
Pinnell, a horticulturist at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. The
staff at the botanical garden paints the insides of terra cotta
pots with black roofing sealant to help them retain moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood is another option _ between terra cotta and plastic in
terms of weight _ and styles in it have really improved,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Exposure. The amount of sunlight the container gets _ and in
the highrise gardener's case, its height and building orientation _
determines the choice of plants.
</P>
<P>
   The higher the location, the more extreme the conditions.
``There's even a big difference between the ground and third floor
once you get above the trees,'' Smearman said. ``Anything above 10
floors with southern or western exposure has nothing to abate the
sun because in Atlanta, except for downtown, most of our taller
buildings are isolated and exposed rather than close together,
where they would shade each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that because homeowners increasingly opt for
low-maintenance gardens, the supply of drought-tolerant annuals,
perennials and shrubs is widely available.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Soil. Container plants perform best in loose, soilless potting
mix _ not heavy potting soils _ in which their roots can freely
integrate, Pinnell said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Smearman use a Fafard, which contains finely ground pine
bark and peat moss. For perennials, shrubs and small trees, she
prefers a bulkier material that retains moisture, such as Nature's
Helper Organic Soil Conditioner, mixed with one-fourth compost. And
for highrise containers, Smearman top dresses pots with several
inches of Mr. Natural Complete Landscape Mix (Its expanded slate
helps break down soil) to prevent them from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Maintenance. Container gardens benefit from a slow-release
fertilizer, such as Osmocote, which Pinnell recommends mixing with
the soil at planting. And because containers demand frequent
waterings _ _ their soil loses valuable nutrients and therefore
requires more feedings. She uses a water-soluable granular
fertilizer, such as Miracle Gro or Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wind potential, plants in highrise containers
typically require staking, and don't be afraid to prune them,
Pinnell said, especially trailers such as petunias and verbena. The
ones at the botanical garden are cut back by one-third at three
times during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, they don't look like they've had their summer crew
cut,'' she said.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino, Tom
Sabulis, and Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM) 1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kathleen Turner,
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacNicol and Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler
leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94 minutes
chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob
Longino)94 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' PG-13 (sexually suggestive scenes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Glenn Close,
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   This Southern gothic shaggy-dog story goes down as sweet and
smooth as a double shot of Jack Black. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore,
Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty and Lyle
Lovett are among those involved in the unexpected death of a gently
demented Mississippi widow (Patricia Neal). A mellow Robert Altman
directs this magnolia-scented whimsy with affection and compassion.
(ERG) 2 hours. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's 1st Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Thomas
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, Fred Newman
</P>
<P>
   and Constance Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis) 1 hour, 17 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' R (strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elodie Bouche
</P>
<P>
   and Natacha Regnier.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful character study of two young women trying to make
sense of life in a working-class town. The film is shot with a
documentarian style that registers every nuance. Subtitles. (SM) 1
hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey
</P>
<P>
   and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's comedy. Yeah, it's too much like ``The
Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and strong
cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin Landau)
help it stand on its own. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a bittersweet ode to the everyday lies
people tell themselves to justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44
min. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' PG-13 (violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery
</P>
<P>
   and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``eXistenZ'' R (violence, sexual themes,
</P>
<P>
   general nastiness)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh
</P>
<P>
   and Jude Law.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, virtual-reality games have become so
mind-blowing that a counter-movement called realists has arisen.
One of their targets is celebrity game inventor Jennifer Jason
Leigh. Fans of director David Cronenberg know to expect
mutilations, mutations and pitch-black humor. But whether he's
cracking you up or grossing you out, his is a unique cinematic
vision. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A -
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' R (drug content, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf,
</P>
<P>
   Katie Holmes and Jay Mohr.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part comedy-drama unfolding on a single Christmas Eve,
it has the energetic, late-night delirium of a Chinese fire drill.
You could think of it as a movie built on ``X's.'' We get Xmas,
exhilaration, exhaustion, excitement and the drug called ecstasy,
better known as X. It's a bright, shining package. And though it
turns out to be pretty empty, you can't help admiring how cleverly
it's wrapped. (SM) 1 hour, 42 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Hideous Kinky'' R (brief nudity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Winslet stars in this independent film about a single mom
who takes her daughters to 1972 Marrakesh in search of
enlightenment. Set in the waning days of flower power, the movie
portrays a generation whose idealism had its poisonous side.
Winslet gives a wondrously brave performance as a loving but
blinkered mother whose feckless romanticism makes her a benign
menace to her kids. (ERG) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at generating laughs out of a
throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1 hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock
</P>
<P>
   and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet
</P>
<P>
   Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy Ritchie piles on the
characters, plot twists and violence, but one thing is clear:
everyone involved had a fine time making this movie. You'll have
fun watching it. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost &AMP; Found'' PG-13 (profanity and gross-out scenes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Spade
</P>
<P>
   and Sophie Marceau.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about David Spade's new movie ``Lost &AMP; Found''
that's way too much like last summer's over-the-top _ and better _
comedy ``There's Something About Mary.'' Like gross humor that'll
kick your gag reflex into gear. Still, Spade's flick has its
moments _ especially his knockout impersonation of Neil Diamond.
(Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovers
</P>
<P>
   of the Arctic Circle'' R (profanity and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fele Martinez
</P>
<P>
   and Najwa Nimri.
</P>
<P>
   The fickle finger of fate is both the theme and operative plot
device in this foolish, overwrought Spanish film. Otto (Fele
Martinez) and Ana
</P>
<P>
   (Najwa Nimri) meet as children, realize they're soul mates and
survive the vicissitudes of fate as circumstances conspire to throw
them together, then tear them apart. Not a tedious movie but
irksome as it strives for a romanticism it never quite achieves.
Subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 52 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please both comic book
fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with
stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns its
explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent bullets. (SM) 2 hours,
15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland'' Not rated (but there is sex, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Bale
</P>
<P>
   and Emily Watson.
</P>
<P>
   This film wonders if settling down is the same as selling out.
In 1977, a 30-ish ad man (Christian Bale) with a wife (Emily
Watson), baby, mortgage, etc. is taunted by his free-wheeling '60s
youth when an old buddy shows up. The movie starts well but seems
to lose energy. Still, the theme is worthy and the performances
good, especially Watson, who does hard-headed sensible as well as
high-strung flaky. (ERG) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM) . 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Name Is Joe'' R (language, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   some discreet sex and mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Peter Mullan.
</P>
<P>
   The titular Joe (Peter Mullan) is another of director Ken
Loach's sturdy working-class blokes. A recovering Glasgow
alcoholic, Joe begins a tentative and touching affair with a
good-hearted social worker. But his fragile peace with his past
becomes achingly clear, threatening their relationship. A slight
but affecting film anchored by Mullan's great performance (he won
best actor at Cannes) and Loach's evocative direction. (ERG) 1
hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' PG-13 (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a mid-20s newspaper copy editor
and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they called her)
who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter, promptly
relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way to
popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The movie's
jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does make a go
of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use,
</P>
<P>
   some thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Goldie Hawn and John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess from the start. Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy Clark
(Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio trying to
redefine their lives now that the children are grown. They land in
New York and high jinks ensue. The only time the film hints at the
madcap success it could be is when John Cleese appears as the
secretly cross-dressing hotel manager. (Drew Jubera) 1 hour, 31
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Billy Bob
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, Cate Blanchett
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   A juiced-up ensemble comedy-drama that loses its bearings
halfway through its flight. John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton play
rival air traffic controllers who keep 747s from colliding every
few seconds in the super-crowded sky above New York. The talented
supporting cast includes Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') and
Angelina Jolie. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours , 3 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscars, including best picture. Poor, overworked Will
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play ``Romeo and
Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand of
noblewoman Viola
</P>
<P>
   (Gwyneth Paltrow, who received an Oscar for best actress) in
this witty comedy that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot
devices. (SM) 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!'' R (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   violent anti-social behavior, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Lillard.
</P>
<P>
   This energetic, amusing but scattered film introduces us to
Stevo's (Matthew Lillard) world of beer blasts, punk bands, acid
trips and run-ins with the rednecks of Salt Lake City, circa 1985.
A picaresque romp, it wants to be a ``Trainspotting''-Lite, an
Americanized howl against conformity that winds up, well,
conforming. (SM) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You'' PG-13 (sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   alcohol/drug-related scenes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Stiles
</P>
<P>
   and Heath Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
References to the original verge on precious. But the film also has
a few nutty touches of its own. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
At Fernbank Museum of Natural History. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    Untangling mystery of the rambling hose
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When I began gardening in Atlanta 10 years ago, one of
my first moves was dismantling a watering system installed by the
previous owners. The system, sprinkler heads sticking out of the
ground, fed by water pipes and controlled by timers, seemed
excessively unnecessary for my small space.
</P>
<P>
   More important, I've always preferred watering manually,
dragging around a hosepipe, as I grew up calling it (I've since
learned it's a watering hose). Watering by hand allows me _
encourages me, actually _ to get a good, close-up look at plants,
so I can see what shape they're in, discover whether they're about
to go bloom or bust. With a sprinkler system, it's possible to go
for weeks, months, even, without peering into the face of an abelia
or a leucothoe, looking down the throat of a daylily.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, I've looked into a lot of faces, down
countless throats, put a lot water onto the ground. And I've
dragged a lot of hosepipe. In the process I've learned an essential
truth about this indispensable gardening tool: It will always find
a way to frustrate you.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, I didn't always notice the diabolical side of watering
hoses. As a boy playing through the sultry seasons of Alabama,
Mississippi and Illinois, I enjoyed hosepipes immensely. Spraying
friends and getting sprayed by them was great fun. Refreshing, too.
As was that joyful and timeless pose struck by millions of boys of
summer: hose held in one hand, going full blast past mouth
capturing part of cooling stream. Ahhh is all we said.
</P>
<P>
   I've said a lot of unprintables since those idyllic days, as
hoses have found ways to get tangled up when there were no ways.
</P>
<P>
   Whether hoses changed, or whether I did, entanglement seems much
more prevalent these days. Rubber, vinyl, expensive, cheap _ it
doesn't seem to matter to a rambling hose. Never do I get through a
watering without marveling at how adept these tubes are at grabbing
on to something. Anything.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with my pulling the hose out of the crawl space.
Before I've unfurled 10 feet, the thing has somehow stretched a
foot upward and twisted itself around a faucet handle. Once out, it
never misses an opportunity to crimp, cutting the flow of water
down to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's not crimping, it's wrapping around itself like a
demented snake, forcing me to pick through its 75 feet to find head
and tail.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot in my garden, where the walkway makes a 90-degree
turn, no hose can ever make the corner without grabbing raised
bricks and holding on until pried loose. Similarly, one rosemary
unfortunate enough to live in my watering path gets grabbed and
choked as if by a boa constrictor. This routine mugging got so bad
that the poor rosemary had gotten shaky, threatening to fall out of
the ground. So, the other day, I put a rock in front of it, hoping
to protect it from the rubber marauder.
</P>
<P>
   Problem with the rock is that any object in the garden amounts
to a hose magnet. While the rock will protect the rosemary, it also
will give the hose another snagging point, joining all the
containers, benches, bricks and various follies scattered through
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how carefully I try to guide a hose through
soft-stemmed plants such as coneflower and zinnia, it manages to
stretch out and roll onto them, pinning them to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions don't come easy.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, thinking my hose was too inflexible, I bought
one that seemed soft and manageable. But as soon as it got home and
engorged, it grew as untamed as the rest, jumping here and there,
unpredictably. At another time, I went from a 100-foot hose to one
half that length, believing the shorter pipe would be more wieldy.
It wasn't. I tried one of those ``hose pots,'' hoping it would
allow me to use only as much pipe as I needed, leaving the rest
neatly coiled. Of course, it refused to coil in a continuous
circle, preferring to go clockwise, then counterclockwise, then
clockwise again. I ended up with half a hose in the pot and the
other half twisted outside it. Eventually, some foolish thief stole
the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Given hoses' hellish behavior and my increasing reliance on them
amid so many hot, dry seasons, I must confess there have been times
I regretted undoing that automatic sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   When such second thoughts strike, I open the faucet wide,
maneuver the hosepipe into position, blast a few aphids off the
rose bush, and then, as the water grows cooler and cooler, I let it
streak across my lips. Ahhh.

 &HT;    Maternity clothes with versatility can keep any mom-to-be
looking stylish while waiting for the big event
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A stylish maternity wardrobe is not an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're expecting a millennium baby or an heir in a few
months, you can find cool-looking comfortable clothes that'll take
you from work to play.
</P>
<P>
   The key to building your versatile wardrobe is to base it around
key pieces in a basic color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've invested in core pieces, then add layers, suggests
Cherie Serota, who co-authored ``Pregnancy Chic'' (Random House,
$16.95) with her partner, Jody Kozlow Gardner. For warm weather,
they suggest a cotton twin set, a shirt jacket in stretch twill and
a V-neck T-shirt. For cooler weather, consider a turtleneck
sweater, a bootleg pant and a cardigan jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But versatile doesn't have to mean boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnant women simply want to wear trendy fashions, in both
color and style,'' says Lisa Price, owner of the Great Beginnings
maternity shop on Cheshire Bridge Road. She should know, since
Price and her husband, David, are expecting their first baby in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to offer clothes that will make women feel good about
themselves,'' she said. This season that includes trendy Capris,
men's-style shirts, and pretty, simple dresses.
</P>
<P>
   To help a woman look fashionable throughout her pregnancy, we
chose nine essential items for those nine special months. Our color
scheme? Black and white with touches of color.
</P>
<P>
   C A S U A L
</P>
<P>
   1. Chic Capris are the must-have pants of the season. These
black stretch twill pants, from Belly Basics ($55), hit midcalf;
inserts of elastic on both sides of the pant allow the belly to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   2. The ultimate men's shirt comes in white cotton or colorful
French blue stripes ($69) from Belly Basics. Wear it over all types
of pants as well as short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   3. Low-heeled shoes are essentials, and black slides from BCBG
($94.95) are simple and easy to, well, slide into. However, some
offices might consider them too sporty; if that's the case, stick
to low-heeled pumps and keep your slides for the weekends. Just
make sure your toes are well-pedicured. Clothes and slides from
Nordstrom in Perimeter Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Day-to-evening
</P>
<P>
   4. The trendy twin set has morphed into the newest blazer. It's
hot fashion news but cool to wear, if the sweaters are knitted from
cotton, silk or a rayon blend. This floral rayon/nylon set (tank is
$180; cardigan is $220) can be worn together in the office. For a
dressy look on the town, remove the cardigan. From A Pea in the Pod
in Phipps Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   5. Well-cut trousers are versatile and a wardrobe must. Try
these black rayon pants ($98), which can be dressed up or down. At
Great Beginnings on Cheshire Bridge Road.
</P>
<P>
   Professional
</P>
<P>
   6. Give me a T-shirt in a short-sleeved, white cotton V-neck.
The essential layering piece can be worn alone, under jackets or
cardigan sweaters. This version ($36) is from Belly Basics. At
Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   7. The little black skirt with its elastic waist can be dressed
up or down and worn with a variety of tops. This polyester skirt
($88) is from A Pea in the Pod.
</P>
<P>
   8. The jacket of all trades is a comfy one in pale blue linen.
This version ($148) has the chic styling of a shirt and is perfect
to wear with skirts or trousers. The chic designer diaper bag ($80)
is by Kenneth Cole. Both items from A Pea in the Pod.
</P>
<P>
   After-five9. A pretty empire-styled dress is perfect for formal
occasions. Pink is big this year and looks fetching on most
moms-to-be. This dress in silk charmeuse ($168) was designed by
Nancy Hellmuth. At Great Beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating with a neutral color a good place to start
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a maternity wardrobe? Here are additional tips for
moms-in-the-making:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Base your wardrobe on a neutral color. Dressing from head to
toe in black, beige or navy looks elegant and clean-lined. Add
color through accessories or layering pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For those of you who want help finding mix-and-match maternity
separates, consider kits, such as Belly Basics' Pregnancy Survival
Kit. Created five years ago by New York marketing executives Cherie
Serota and Jody Kozlow Gardner, the little white box contains four
core black pieces: a short skirt, leggings, a tunic and a
knee-length, long-sleeve dress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy your maternity clothes in stages. ``Your waistline expands
first, then your belly,'' says shop owner Price. ``I didn't need
the stretch panels at first in skirts and pants, but at five
months, I started to appreciate them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep to your size. Maternity fashions are made with the same
proportions as nonmaternity clothes, but with additional room in
the belly. If you are a size 8 before you are pregnant, buy that
same size in maternity wear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for dresses and tops that have tiebacks. These can be
loosened as your pregnancy progresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Play up your positive features. If you have good legs, show
them off with a short dress or skirt. If your eyes are blue, play
them up with the color shirt you choose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Steer clear of splashy prints that aren't slimming to start
with. Why wear them now? Stick to small prints or stripes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accessories such as scarves, pearl necklaces and button
earrings can change the look of a basic dress or pantsuit to
increase your wardrobe's versatility.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you wear a supportive bra and maternity hosiery.

 &HT;    Finally, mom gets the royal treatment
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton / Fashion Editor
 &HT;    Photos By Jean Shifrin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Last month, we invited readers to write in and
nominate mothers whom they felt were deserving of a ``supermodel''
makeover. Out of nearly 100 entries _ all of them worthy _ we
selected two winners based on the special sacrifices they've made
for their families' sakes. What follows is a detailed description
of a day like no other for each of them, a day they spent being
pampered instead of pampering those they love.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANA _ Stoicism is a virtue that Carole Arnoldi and Sunghee
Lee have in common. But there's a time and a place for keeping a
stiff upper lip, and the occasion of having a Mother's Day makeover
isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   If Arnoldi and Lee had been more accustomed to being fussed
over, Stan Milton Salon cosmetician Karin Robinson would have had
an easier time applying their makeup. ``It's funny how tense they
are,'' Robinson commented during a break in the five-hour
``supermodel'' makeover session that the two were awarded. ``I have
to keep telling them, `Relax, girls; this is supposed to be fun.'
''
</P>
<P>
   But as this was the first-ever makeover for each of the moms,
both of whom were nominated by their daughters, the nervousness was
understandable. ``I'm not used to the attention,'' explained
Arnoldi.
</P>
<P>
   They got a quick lesson in being attended to. As soon as they
arrived, a team of salon staffers converged to see what they had to
work with in terms of skin, hair and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Milton and his chief colorist, Kirby Allen, did an analysis of
Lee's hair and determined that she needed color enhancement,
reddish-brown highlights and a cut that was more flattering to her
bone structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure about this,'' Lee said in Korean, through her
daughter, Jennifer, who came along to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Lee saw the tomato-red dye that Allen was applying,
she yelled across the salon to her daughter, ``What's he doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The makeup application process proved easier for the pair to
endure. In fact, when lunchtime arrived, both Lee and Arnoldi opted
to go hungry rather than risk smudging their lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   But before the cosmetic phase, the two were introduced to
something neither had ever tried: eyebrow waxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have it done for the first time, the skin in the
treated area does tend to get red and irritated,'' said esthetician
Brenda Smith. ``But if they continue to wax, their faces will get
used to it and the hairs that grow back will be softer and easier
to remove.''
</P>
<P>
   The final phase was outfitting the pair in designer fashions and
getting them to pose in glamour mode. That's when their
camera-shyness really surfaced. Luckily, both had their children
present to help coax smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she felt ``younger'' after the makeover experience. ``I
learned how to do my makeup. . . . That's new to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arnoldi prepared to leave the salon, she still seemed
embarrassed by all the attention. But she did remark on the
makeover's potential residual effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be habit-forming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Headline) Kids' future prompts move from South Korea
</P>
<P>
   Sunghee Lee's children are no dummies.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter who nominated Lee for a makeover, Jennifer Kim, is
a sophomore at Emory University, double-majoring in economics and
neuroscience behavioral biology. And her son, Michael, the quiet
one, is a Georgia Tech senior studying computer science.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 49, a homemaker who lives in Marietta (Ga.), left a
husband, and a life, behind in South Korea five years ago to help
ensure that her children's futures would be as bright as they now
appear. She hasn't made many friends and speaks hardly any English,
so social contact is restricted mostly to Sunday services at her
Korean-speaking Protestant church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything she does is sacrificial,'' daughter Jennifer said.
``I try to buy her gifts now and then, to please her. But what she
really needs is to do something for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   (Headline) Partner in fight against cancer
</P>
<P>
   When a woman spends nine years nursing her husband through a
losing battle with cancer, it's understandable that she could lose
some of her sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Recently widowed Carole Arnoldi, 51, of Peachtree City (Ga.) was
nominated by her daughter, Tina, because ``she needs somebody to
pay attention to her needs for a change. She needs to be
pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three appeared nervous when she arrived for her
makeover at Stan Milton Salon, and she grew even more reluctant
when the time came to pose for a post-makeover glamour shot. She
endured the whole process because her daughter wanted her to. And
that's what being selfless is all about.

 &HT;    Relax and breathe in the mystery of life in S.C. Lowcountry
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE GRAND STRAND, S.C. _ Not long after I cross the Little Pee
Dee River, cruising toward the coast along U.S. 501 through
wide-spot-in-the-road towns of Galivant's Ferry and Aynor, the
head-turning roadside billboards begin to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo's Steakhouse hawks a sizzling slab of beef called the Big
Daddy. The Landmark resort crows over its 10 pools. Ripley's
Aquarium promises ``more fish, more fun.'' Everything in Myrtle
Beach, it seems, sells some sort of abundance: 100 golf courses,
all-you-can-eat seafood buffets. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I'm on a trip to bountiful, but it's bounty of a different sort.
I've come in search of the laid-back side of the Grand Strand, the
lofty-sounding name given to the upper reaches of South Carolina's
Lowcountry. I'm interested in catching glimpses of alligators and
ospreys, hearing Gullah ghost tales and finding traces of tideland
rice plantations that flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At last I spy a billboard that suits my style. It reads simply:
Glitz. Circa 1700s. Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that Georgetown is on my itinerary. But
first, I'm bound for Conway, 15 miles northwest of Myrtle Beach.
Then, I'll be heading south to the coastal towns of Murrells Inlet
and Pawleys Island before reaching the historic seaport of
Georgetown, about 40 miles from Conway.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four days, armed with the pocket-size South
Carolina Nature-Based Tourism Directory, I'll explore the natural
amenities and history of the Waccamaw Neck, the land between the
river and the coast, in Horry and Georgetown counties.
</P>
<P>
   I'll marvel at the wondrous marriage of art and nature at
Brookgreen Gardens, a sprawling paradise near Pawleys Island.
Across U.S. 17 at Huntington Beach State Park, I'll wander through
wisteria-draped archways at a 15th-century-style brick Spanish
castle named Atalaya, where Anna Hyatt Huntington created many of
the massive sculptures that grace Brookgreen.
</P>
<P>
   While I prefer to stay at bed-and-breakfast inns (the more
historic and out of the way the better), there are plenty of
hotels, motels, condos, beach houses and campgrounds on and near
U.S. 17 that may work better for families.
</P>
<P>
   Even kids hooked on miniature golf and water parks will no doubt
find adventures of the eco kind to be lots of fun. For instance,
there's Capt. Dick's Saltwater Marsh Explorer, Carolina Safari Jeep
Tours and sailings across Winyah Bay aboard the schooner Jolly
Rover with a pirate guide. And for hands-on action, families can
rent bicycles for a spin under moss-draped live oaks or embark on a
canoe or kayak expedition in tea-colored rivers and cypress swamps.
</P>
<P>
   There's mystery, it seems, around every bend.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent blue-sky Sunday, Virgil Graham steers his bright red
Carolina Safari jeep off busy U.S. 17 and through the gates of
Huntington Beach State Park. He turns our attention to the dense
subtropical forest we are entering, a green tangle of wild
muscadine vines, palm, bladderwort and Venus' flytrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prehistoric,'' Graham pronounces, almost reverently.
``Prehistoric is how it looks to me. Primeval.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Lois Brunetti of New York, who just the night before
partied with friends at the Myrtle Beach House of Blues, gets the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurassic Park,'' she says, nodding.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally.

 &HT;    4-Day trip turns back the clock and spotlights the world around
us
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rivers are dark, the marshes mysterious and the gnarled live
oaks with their filigree of silvery moss hold ancient secrets. The
upper coast of South Carolina, with its natural charms, beckons to
the adventure seeker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we call nature-based tourism is just outdoor recreation
with a new spin on it,'' says Tim Todd of the 5-year-old South
Carolina Nature-Based Tourism Association.
</P>
<P>
   By any name, it's a compelling reason to wander off the usual
track, as I did on a recent four-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   Conway, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to pass right by Conway as you speed along U.S.
501 toward Myrtle Beach _ and 50,000 cars do just that each day in
the summer. But if you turn left on Third Avenue just before
crossing the Waccamaw River, you'll discover a tidy little town of
12,000, where massive live oaks have the right of way and a
downtown renaissance has brought trendy restaurants, chic shops,
antiques and art galleries to Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach, interestingly, was developed as a resort by F.G.
Burroughs of Conway more than a century ago and named by his wife
for the myrtle trees abundant in the area.
</P>
<P>
   I have just enough time to check in at the 2-year-old Cypress
Inn and meet innkeepers Carol and Jim Ruddick before walking to the
Conway Marina to make the 2 p.m. river cruise on the Kingston Lady.
We'll be rolling down the winding Waccamaw, which cuts through a
vast cypress swamp. Capt. Dick Davis is hoping the alligator the
school kids saw on his morning cruise will still be sunning on the
banks of the Waccamaw. ``Musta been 300 pounds,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis steers his vessel through the deep, dark caramel water
tinted by tannin, he regales his passengers with stories of the
steamship era, the sawmilling industry, Native Americans and
Spanish invaders, and nomadic tribes of 10,000 years ago. He points
out green river turtles (also called cooters) on logs, otter and
beaver, heron and kingfisher, and, yes, that lazy ol' gator.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an hour down the winding river, we see the restored
plantation home built by Henry Buck of Bucksport, Maine, who
purchased 12,000 acres along the Waccamaw in the 1820s and
established a sawmill and later a shipbuilding business.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the marina, Davis tells us that Conway was founded
in 1735 as Kingston to be a defensive outpost for Charleston a
hundred miles south.
</P>
<P>
   I want to know more, so I strike out with the city's visitor
coordinator Betty Molnar, who has developed several self-guided
tours, including ``A Guide to Some of Our Oldest Citizens,'' the
revered live oaks, whose spreading branches embrace the town and
provide a playhouse for squirrels. (Don't be surprised when the
pavement detours around one of the massive trees.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing is the Alligator Oak in the First
United Methodist Church cemetery at Fifth Avenue and Main Street.
Look at the round knot on the trunk as an eye and use your
imagination. Across the street are two more treasured trees in
front of the Horry County Museum (it's pronounced oh-REE). Don't
miss the handmade porcelain dolls representing five women whose
life stories encapsulate the town's history.
</P>
<P>
   Walking tours start at the Conway Area Chamber of Commerce at
Second and Main, where you can pick up a map and guides. The
downtown is compact, so you can easily wander down to the
Riverwalk, stroll Main Street with its boutiques, antique stores
and restaurants, and stop by the Presbyterian Church cemetery
that's on the National Register of Historic Places because of its
Victorian grave statuary featuring sculpted figures of children
sleeping beneath a tabletop.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-room Cypress Inn on Elm Street is the only B&AMP;B in the
historic district, and its location overlooking the Waccamaw is
ideal: The Riverfront Tennis Center is across the street and next
door is the Conway Marina, where you can rent canoes and
paddleboats. Although modern, the three-story inn evokes the 19th
century. The rooms, decorated with antique furnishings and designer
fabrics and wallcoverings, feature Jacuzzi tubs. The front porch,
lined with rockers, overlooks a small private marina. Never-empty
pitchers of lemonade and iced tea await guests.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the locals clamor for tables at the trendy Rivertown
Bistro. Friday night dinner was everything it was cracked up to be:
crawfish au gratin on fried zucchini with roasted sweet red pepper
cream, raspberry salad (mixed greens topped with roasted pecans,
feta cheese and raspberry vinaigrette) and lightly blackened
dolphin on a jalapeno grits cake topped with a blue crab shallot
cream.
</P>
<P>
   I'll work all this off tomorrow, I tell myself.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY MORNING
</P>
<P>
   Murrells Inlet
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Capt. Dick's Ma-
</P>
<P>
   rina for the Saltwater Marsh Explorer excursion, I promptly
purchase a sweat shirt in the store. I'm ill prepared for the cold
front that's moving through. Not so the Junior Girl Scouts of Troop
20 from Summerville, S.C., who scramble onto the boat in a giggling
mass. A curious brown pelican watches from a post.
</P>
<P>
   Marine biologist Robert Van Buskirk shows off a cannonball
jellyfish he scooped in a net as it floated beside the boat. It
looks like a huge, slick shiitake mushroom. A crab has hitched a
ride under its umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slimed me,'' says Van Buskirk, as the girls squeal eeeyew
and back away. ``Don't become a marine biologist if you don't like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hands fly up when Van Buskirk asks for volunteers to stuff
fish parts into the crab trap. Soon, they're all digging in a layer
of muck from the marsh floor, holding up a sort of yucky algae
called dead man's fingers and pursuing skittish hermit crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buskirk tells us the salt marsh is like a big fish nursery,
where puffers, sea robins, skate and pinfish begin their lives. We
have about a half-hour for shelling on a barrier island.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back in, the Girl Scouts chatter about their
adventure. What did 9-year-old Chanelle Davis like? ``The pelican,
the animals, and the ride was smooth. And the gift shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Back onshore, I give in to a powerful craving for _ what else? _
seafood. Capt. Dave's Dockside Restaurant is just yards away. I
polish off a basket of quarter-sized hush puppies and honey butter
before tucking into a divine Lowcountry concoction of shrimp with
sausage and tasso gravy over creamy grits. Neptune never ate so
well.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY AFTERNOON
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown
</P>
<P>
   The sun reappears, but my anticipated afternoon sail on the
Jolly Rover tall ship from Georgetown's pleasant Harbor Walk has
been scrubbed thanks to the unsettled morning weather. So instead,
I hop aboard a green trolley in front of the visitor center on
Front Street for some dry-land cruising around the seaport that was
discovered by the Spanish in 1526 and laid out in 1729 by Elisha
Screven along the Sampit River.
</P>
<P>
   Several early 18th century houses still stand, and many more
date to the 19th century. At least a half-dozen homes in the
National Register Historic District are now bed-and-breakfast inns.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest church is the Prince George Episcopalian, whose first
services were held in 1747 when the church building was under
construction. A 250-year-old live oak presides over the cemetery,
where members of many prominent families are buried.
</P>
<P>
   The 1841 town clock tower on Front Street now houses the Rice
Museum, whose exhibits trace the rise and fall of rice cultivation
on coastal plantations. At the other end of downtown is the
Kaminski House, built in 1769 by a local merchant. It is now a
house museum filled with English and American furniture and
artifacts dating from the late 1700s and significant pieces by
Charleston cabinetmakers of the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1812, Theodosia Burr Allston left Georgetown harbor on the
Patriot to visit her father, Aaron Burr, in New York. The ship was
lost at sea in a violent storm or, some say, sunk by pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her ghost is often seen walking along, retracing her last
steps on earth,'' says trolley guide/driver Glen Morris.
</P>
<P>
   She's but one of the many souls believed to be roaming around
Georgetown County. There's Alice, a young woman who wanders about
looking for her lost engagement ring from the boy her family would
not permit her to marry. And the Gray Man of Pawleys Island, who
perished in a hurricane and now warns tourists to take cover when
storms approach.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield Plantation
</P>
<P>
   A fingernail of a moon hangs low in the eerie black sky as I
drive down a two-mile unpaved road through dense forest, back to
the antebellum rice plantation where I'm spending two nights. I've
been in Georgetown for a dinner of lime-spiked Bahamian grouper and
wild rice at the Rice Paddy overlooking the Sampit River.
</P>
<P>
   Rice. It's a leitmotif throughout the Tidelands. Long-grain rice
turned wealthy planters into Southern aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is no longer cultivated in the region's marshes _ it hasn't
been since the late 1920s _ but remnants of 19th-century abundance
remain at Mansfield. An avenue of 160-year-old oaks leads past rows
of slave houses and a slave chapel to the modest plantation house
and its outbuildings, including stables and a winnowing house.
Overnight visitors stay in one of three guest houses and gather in
the formal dining room in the main house for a breakfast served on
good china.
</P>
<P>
   The property, stretching from U.S. 701 to the Black River, is
inhabited by deer, alligators, ducks, woodpeckers, owls and many
other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Jim Cahalan have owned the plantation since 1994, when
she inherited it from her father, Wilbur Smith. Guests come to
explore the cypress swamps in canoes and kayaks, go duck hunting
with Jim or just settle into a rope hammock or lawn chair to take
in the views of the marshlands.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield's natural setting appeals to four researchers on a
geology field trip from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts. Fossils from limestone samples they dig from Pee Dee
River formations will be used in experiments to help predict
climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area was under the ocean at one time,'' says Marti
Jeglinski. ``This is where a lot of those fossils were
distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   And after a day of digging _ or sightseeing, for that matter _
those hammocks look mighty inviting.

   SOUTH CAROLINA: look mighty inviting.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Safari
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into the back of Carolina Safari's big red tour Jeep for
a jaunt into the wilds of coastal South Carolina from Myrtle Beach
to Pawleys Island, I feel like a kid at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun bouncing down U.S. 17 with naturalist-photographer
Virgil Graham at the wheel. As he drives, the Myrtle Beach native
shares his knowledge of the area's history in a rambling narrative
that touches on Spanish settlement in the 1500s, pirate escapades,
indigo cultivation, salt mines, turpentine production and the
origins of Calabash shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   In Murrells Inlet, we hear the tale of a sailor named Drunken
Jack and the treasure he buried and see in the distance the island
that bears his name. Even though it's not open for lunch, Graham
drives us by the area's oldest seafood restaurant, Oliver's Lodge,
built in 1859 and a dining spot since 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing south, we pull in at the entrance of Brookgreen
Gardens for a bit of background on the world's largest sculpture
garden, established in 1930 by Archer Huntington and his wife,
sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington. Graham whets my appetite for a
visit the next day.
</P>
<P>
   We cross the highway to Huntington Beach State Park, where the
Huntington's Moorish-style beach retreat Atalaya stands roofless
but still fortress-like, with sturdy brick walls and iron window
bars. Inside the park, we stop to look at alligators sunning on a
small island and observe osprey and cormorants. There, standing in
the spartina grass, is a great white egret in a National
Geographic-worthy pose _ as if he is well aware of the
point-and-shoot cameras aimed his way.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we're on our way to a rice plantation that's now a golf
course and a historic cemetery on Pawleys Island. Graham gives us
his interpretation of the Gullah dialect and spins yarns about
plat-eyes, boo-daddies and haints _ the boogeymen of Gullah
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is at All Saints Waccamaw Parish Church,
established 1767. It's the burial site of poet James Dickey
(1923-1997), whose granite tombstone is engraved with the words ``I
move at the heart of the world.'' But most intriguing is the
gravestone of a young woman named Alice, buried in ignominy near
the brothers who disowned her for defying them when they forbade
her to see the man she loved. Someone ha-- left dimes and pennies
on a flat stone with the simple inscription: ALICE.
</P>
<P>
   At the Island Country Store restaurant, where we lunch at picnic
tables under the live oaks, we devour fried grouper sandwiches
while watching boat-tailed grackles help themselves to leftovers at
uncleared tables.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY
</P>
<P>
   Brookgreen Gardens
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I enter the gates, I know I've come to a special
place. Even so, I was unprepared for the dramatic impact of this
300-acre botanical garden in the heart of a 9,100-acre preserve
stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the historic rice fields of
the Waccamaw River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray Oaks of Mystery,'' a poetic 10-minute video shown in the
Welcome Center, sets the tone for my visit. By the time I reach the
pool with Huntington's graceful sculpture ``Diana of the Chase'' in
the middle, I have become keenly aware that this is a place where
art and nature are in harmonic convergence.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1930, the land that once comprised four rice plantations
has been a natural haven for more than 500 outdoor sculptures, many
created by Anna Hyatt Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew this was back here?'' exclaims Norma Benton of Kansas
City, echoing the sentiment of many awed visitors. ``We've been
coming to Myrtle Beach for years and had seen the sculpture at the
entrance, but we had no idea it would be this wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookgreen isn't exactly a secret. The first public sculpture
garden built in the United States, it is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   From the Diana fountain, an allee of 250-year-old live oaks
leads to a series of connecting gardens, designed by the
Huntingtons in the shape of a butterfly, as a backdrop for Anna's
sculptures. Soon, other sculptors _ Daniel Chester French, Gutzon
Borglum, Frederic Remington _ were invited to exhibit pieces from
small to monumental among the plant collection of 2,000 species.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the outdoor displays, there are two indoor
exhibits in the Rainey Sculpture Pavilion: ``Birds of a Feather:
Sculpture From the Brookgreen Collection'' and ``The Sculpture of
Grainger McKoy,'' a temporary exhibit that will be up through the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens are also designated as a wildlife sanctuary; 194
species of birds have been identified. The Lowcountry Wildlife
Trail north of the formal gardens offers visitors the chance to see
native wildlife in natural habitats along a paved three-quarter
mile path. There is a cypress aviary, otter pond, alligator swamp,
fox glade, raptor aviary and white-tailed deer savanna.
</P>
<P>
   I buy a ticket for a one-hour creek excursion on the 48-foot
pontoon boat Springfield (on weekends, two-hour cruises past Sandy
Island and 18th- and 19th-century plantation houses on the Waccamaw
are offered). Guide Lucius Fishburne explains that we are floating
on canals dug by slaves, taking advantage of the twice daily tidal
fluctuations to flood and drain the rice fields.
</P>
<P>
   On this brief cruise, we see an alligator swimming near the
dock, a turtle that ducks when he sees the gator coming, a great
blue heron and an osprey tending its nest. Wooden boxes on posts
have been erected along the creekside as wood duck habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Plan to spend a full day or more (the admission ticket is good
for seven days). There is a shady picnic area near serene Jessamine
Pond as well as the Terrace Cafe, featuring a light menu of
sandwiches, salads and she-crab soup, and the Old Kitchen,
specializing in pastries and hot or cold Carolina peach tea.
</P>
<P>
   Too soon it is closing time. I should have arrived earlier. Four
hours is not nearly long enough to linger in this beauty.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Litchfield Plantation
</P>
<P>
   Good thing I am staying at this very elegant, very Southern
country inn on my last night on the coast. If it had been early in
the trip, it would have been tough to tear myself away for anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Pat and Bea Boland of New Canaan, Conn., were feeling
a couple of days into a weeklong vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been thinking about driving down to Charleston,'' says
Pat, after lingering at least an hour over breakfast at the
Carriage House Club, ``but . . . I don't know. I came here to relax
and I just don't want to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's so much to do inside the gates of the former
rice plantation on Pawleys Island. Tennis courts and a swimming
pool are about it. But the lush natural setting invites indolence:
long strolls on the sweeping green lawns. Drinks on the patio as
sunset drops a pink scrim behind the gray-bearded live oaks beside
the lazy creek. Naps in a big canopied bed.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1750 plantation house, a stately three-story
mansion painted white with black shutters, stands at the end of a
quarter-mile allee of live oaks. A guest house and cottages are
tucked away on these 600 acres sprawling from King's River Road to
the Waccamaw River. A private oceanfront beach house for the use of
guests is about three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   This four-star restaurant is known for creative cuisine in a
clubby atmosphere. A mixed grill of salmon, grouper and beef
tenderloin served with _ you guessed it _ rice was perfect. The
tastiest lemon chess pie I've had in years topped the repast.
</P>
<P>
   Walking back to the mansion, which I had all to myself that
night, I recall the story of a former owner, Dr. Henry M. Tucker,
who made sickbed calls at night. Returning, he would ring the
gatehouse bell with his riding crop. After his death, subsequent
owners of the plantation reported hearing the ringing. Finally, the
bell was removed so they could get some rest.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of long days adventuring in nature, today's guests do
the same.

 &HT;    Before Disney, Southern vacations were a magical mystery tour of
tacky, tawdry delights
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucky for Tim Hollis that his father was such a pack rat. The
old man never tossed anything from their family vacations: road
maps, postcards, tourist brochures, bumper stickers, motel
matchbooks. He even kept their parking stub from the grand opening
of Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis has made loving use of the memorabilia in a new book,
``Dixie Before Disney: 100 Years of Roadside Fun'' (University
Press of Mississippi, $25). Part history, part nostalgia trip, the
oversize paperback documents the era of tourism that faded when
Walt Disney World reared its mighty mouse ears in 1971 and made
everything before seem puny.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollis tells it, the South pioneered tourism American-style.
Natural Bridge, Va., was drawing visitors in the 1700s. (Thomas
Jefferson, who once owned the property, built a cabin for visitors,
making him arguably one of the first tourist court operators.) Hot
Springs, Ark., was designated a federal preserve decades before
Yellowstone. Silver Springs, Fla., was so popular in the 1800s that
two former Union generals, Grant and Sherman, braved hostile
territory to see it _ even without glass-bottom boats.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollis' heart belongs to the 1960s and the roadscape of his
youth. The 36-year-old Birmingham native never got over his first
Howard Johnson's sign; the neon figures of Simple Simon and the Pie
Man seemed to beckon him. He remembers family drives to the beach
and the mountains as a child's delight of flashing marquees, pecan
logs, wax museums and alligator farms. Slow two-lane highways and
shoddy motel rooms are mercifully forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, everyone drove on their vacations, so you had all
these places that were designed to make the trip fun,'' Hollis
says. ``Now more people fly. The trip doesn't matter as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollis, an editor at a small publishing company in Birmingham,
has taken after his late father. He still enjoys driving vacations,
most recently to Gatlinburg, Tenn. And, like his dad, he hangs on
to everything; when Six Flags closed its ``Tales of the
Okefenokee'' ride, he went so far as to dub the soundtrack so he'd
have a recording of the goofy song.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite vacation spots? Rock City and any miniature golf
course with concrete dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   His choice for tackiest tourist trap? It's a tie between two
defunct enterprises: Gatlinburg's ``Tour Through Hell,'' a biblical
house of horrors, and Sarasota's Floridaland, which boasted so many
attractions in one place that visitors were told they could skip
the rest of the Sunshine State. (The concept lives on in Orlando.)
</P>
<P>
   For all his roaming, Hollis has missed a few places that he
memorializes in the book. His biggest regret is that he never made
it to Dogpatch USA, an Arkansas theme park based on the ``Li'l
Abner'' comic strip and a passel of half-witted hillbilly
stereotypes. By the time he got to the Ozarks, hit done closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go back to the site,'' Hollis says. ``Maybe
there's a petrified Li'l Abner sitting out there waiting for me.''

 &HT;    Ceiling fans now easier to install than ever
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if a home has a good air conditioning system, a ceiling fan
can be invaluable when it's muggy outside but not hot enough for
cold air.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have simplified the task of installing ceiling
fans by designing units that require little assembly. Just make
sure the fan includes all the necessary parts.
</P>
<P>
   Jabari Cook, a lighting expert at Home Depot on Cumberland
Parkway, says a standard 8-foot ceiling fan can be installed in
about an hour. Beginners, however, should allot at least 2 1/2
hours to be on the safe side.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the supplies you'll need in addition to the ceiling
fan:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Phillips screwdriver
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A flathead screwdriver
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A package of orange or yellow wire nuts
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A flashlight (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Before you begin:
</P>
<P>
   Turn off the light switch in the room where the fan is to be
installed and the main power switch, to avoid electric shock.
Remove the existing light fixture to expose the junction box and
ceiling wires.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the fan:
</P>
<P>
   (Not pictured.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove all parts from the fan box and insert rubber bushings
into each fan blade. Make sure the bushings are tight, to prevent
the fan from wobbling.
</P>
<P>
   1.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Phillips screwdriver, remove screws on the fan motor;
then insert screws into the fan blades.
</P>
<P>
   2.
</P>
<P>
   Line up the blades with the screw holes and reinsert the screws
that were removed in Step 2. Make sure each blade is screwed
tightly to the motor.
</P>
<P>
   3.
</P>
<P>
   After all fan blades are secured, screw the fan rod to the base
of the fan, making sure the wires are free of tangles. Set aside
until the hanger bracket is installed.
</P>
<P>
   4.
</P>
<P>
   Screw the hanger bracket into the junction box. Make sure it is
screwed in tightly.
</P>
<P>
   4a. (Not pictured.)
</P>
<P>
   Pick up the fan motor with attached blades and let it hang on
the side of the hanger bracket. (A little hook is attached to it to
make installation a one-person job.) Twist each wire from the
junction box clockwise around each fan wire, matching colors. For
example, the black wire from the junction box should be spliced to
the black wire of the fan, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   5.
</P>
<P>
   After the wires are connected, screw the fan rod, which extends
from the center of the fan base, into the hanger bracket. Screw the
canopy to the hanger bracket. At this point, the fan should be
securely mounted to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   6.
</P>
<P>
   To connect the light fixture to the fan, twist the wires from
the light fixture to the fan wires. Again, going clockwise, twist
like colors together. Fold wires at the splice and attach a wire
nut.
</P>
<P>
   Final step:
</P>
<P>
   Screw the light fixture to the fan by lining up holes. Fit the
glass globes over the light sockets and tighten. Turn the power
back on.
</P>
<P>
   7.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the switch, turn on the fan and take a breather.
</P>

`FARE GAMES': A FEW TIPS ON A COUPLE OF NEW YORK CABBIES WHO ARE
NOT HAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No pun intended, but the tale of two cabbies called ``Fare
Games'' is pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   No particular wit or style or particularly insightful
storytelling gifts emerge from this straightforward account of two
friends who drive cabs in the streets of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the misadventures that befall them, like cheap
tippers, nasty fares, deviant passengers and a stickup, clearly
typify life behind the wheel of a yellow cab, ``Fare Games,''
written and directed by Brian O'Hara, never really captures the
pace or essence of the city in relating a familiar story.
</P>
<P>
   Its principal roles are acceptably acted, for the most part, but
some of the lesser portrayals are far from elegant examples of the
actor's art.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cabbies, the tall, good-looking Jimmy (Eddie
Estefan), a long-married suburbanite and father of two children who
are away at summer camp, is eager for more sex than he is getting
at home. The other cabbie, Martin (Russel Stewart), balding,
divorced, with an adolescent daughter who lives far away with her
mother, has no woman in his life.
</P>
<P>
   As the screenplay has it, Jimmy's wildest fantasies come true
when one of his fares turns out to be a young and easily available
new arrival to the city _ a college student who just happens to be
occupying a home (with pool) in Riverdale while her aunt and uncle
are away.
</P>
<P>
   And late one night, Martin's fare turns out to be Susie
(Elizabeth Curtain), a topless dancer in her 20s who first asks him
to pick her up on a regular basis and then accepts his offer of
shelter when her refusal to dance nude costs her her job.
</P>
<P>
   So while Jimmy is frolicking the nights away with Jennifer
(Marina Morgan) and telling preposterous stories about his
whereabouts to his wife, Barbara (Andre Leigh), Martin is
proceeding tentatively into a serious relationship with Susie.
</P>
<P>
   In their regular meetings over lunch in a diner, Martin warns
the smitten Jimmy that his fling is really a flirtation with
marital disaster. Meanwhile the suspicious Barbara, briefed by one
of her frequently divorced girlfriends, is preparing to trap Jimmy
into a confession.
</P>
<P>
   And, the insecure Martin is beginning to believe that his
happiness with Susie is doomed to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fare Games'' may be drawn from life, but it is not drawn with
distinction.

`PUSHER': A DRUG PUSHER'S LIFE IS ROTTEN IN DENMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trainspotting'' was a darkly thrilling film about the lives of
Scottish heroin addicts. ``Pulp Fiction'' was a brilliantly
original look into petty criminals' lives, including heroin sale
and use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pusher,'' a new Danish film, is proof of just how boring a
week in the life of a real heroin dealer probably is.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the film's young director and co-screenwriter,
Nicolas Winding Refn, talks a lot about how proud he is of not
having gone to film school, and how his father _ the film editor
Anders Refn, who worked on, among other things, ``Breaking the
Waves'' _ thought he was insane to try to make a movie without any
training. But he did it, and isn't he clever?
</P>
<P>
   Refn has indeed made a movie. It opens with a drug dealer named
Frank (Kim Bodnia) and his buddy Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen) driving
through parts of Copenhagen with no scenic beauty at all and
discussing how much they enjoy fellatio and other, less
conventional sexual practices.
</P>
<P>
   That's Monday. On Tuesday, Frankie gets a big drug order from a
Swedish customer but has trouble getting the product from his
supplier because he owes him money. On Wednesday, Frankie and Tonny
talk some more about fellatio, as well as whether they should go to
a movie or rent a video.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Frankie makes the sale, but before he can
collect the money, the police arrive. On Thursday Frankie wakes up
in a jail cell. It's downhill from there. At one point, he is
driven to the lowest of lows: asking his mother for money.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two hours, ``Pusher'' seems to be saying: look how
honest and dirty and real we're being, look how we're showing you
the dark underbelly of the world that addiction has made. This
might be effective if the last drug movie in theaters had been
``The Man With the Golden Arm'' (in which Kim Novak helps Frank
Sinatra kick heroin by locking him in a room and hiding the sharp
cutlery). More than 40 years later, it seems almost naive.
</P>
<P>
   But Refn may yet have justification for boasting about his
natural talent. There is one magnificent scene in ``Pusher'' in
which Frankie and his girlfriend, Vic (Laura Drasbaek), come back
to her apartment in a late-night early-morning haze, do drugs
separately and exude a horrible raw loneliness that is painful, but
illuminating, to see. Maybe Refn's next film will take us into that
emotional territory.

WAR MEMORIAL REKINDLES STORIES OF A POPULAR GI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was April 1945, and the 100th Battalion's
Charlie Company was hunkered down on Mount Folgarita near Naples,
about to charge the Nazi line.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest member, young Pfc. Haluto Moriguchi of San Francisco,
was well-liked by his older Japanese-American buddies in the
segregated 100th.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly from Hawaii, they looked out for the young mainlander,
whom they called ``Junior.'' He, in turn, shared the chocolate chip
cookies sent by his sister June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a mail clerk and got to know Junior real well,'' the
late Richard Yamamoto recalled in a memoir. ``He even showed me a
snapshot of June, his cute kid sister ...''
</P>
<P>
   Moriguchi was in the war four months when he was hit by mortar
shell fragments. He died on April 5, 1945. The war in Europe was
over in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Moriguchi's buddies were aboard a cross-country troop train that
summer when it pulled into Salt Lake City. Yamamoto stuck his head
out of the train to get a better view of the Mormon Tabernacle when
he turned and couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, standing alone was this young girl, the exact image of
the snapshot Junior had shown me,'' Yamamoto wrote. ``I called out
and asked if her name was June and she answered yes.''
</P>
<P>
   June had moved to Utah with her parents. They were at the
station to meet returning soldiers who might have known Haluto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a happy and yet sad meeting ... a chance meeting
because of a snapshot of a dear sister that was shown to me,''
Yamamoto said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years after 830 Americans of Japanese ancestry
fought for their country and died on the battlefields of Europe,
the legendary valor of their most well-known units _ the 100th
Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team _ are celebrated in
books, movies and a national exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the 100/442 comprised the most decorated unit in
military history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very personal stories of those who fell in battle are
still unfolding more than 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see Haluto's picture and you say, `Oh my goodness, look
how young he was,''' said Jimmy Yamashita, a 442nd veteran. ``But
his story was typical of many of those killed in action who made
sacrifices. We gotta remember the guys who perished.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita is helping to tell those stories as part of the
Americans of Japanese Ancestry Memorial Alliance's project to
create a CD-ROM preserving the history of those who died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based alliance also is building a memorial wall
at the Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center in Los
Angeles. The memorial will list the names of Japanese-Americans
killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was a misspelling of Haluto's name that uncovered Moriguchi's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Haluto got his unusual name when his father, Torao Moriguchi,
used an ``l'' instead of the usual ``r'' in spelling the Japanese
name, Haruto.
</P>
<P>
   Haluto's sister, Katherine Baishiki, 52, of Belmont, Calif.,
called Yamashita after she saw Haluto's name misspelled in the list
of names for the proposed wall. The two exchanged information and
soon, Haluto Moriguchi's story became part of the CD-ROM project.
</P>
<P>
   Baishiki never met her brother _ she was born after he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never able to do anything for him,'' he said. ``So if I
can get his name corrected, that counts for something.''
</P>
<P>
   But she grew up with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and dad had a picture of him in their bedroom,'' she
said. ``They talked about him all the time, how proud we all were
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   For 68-year-old June Moriguchi of San Francisco, a lifetime has
passed since her teen-age brother hugged her and said, ``If I don't
come back, you take care of Mom and Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only 13 at the time,'' Moriguchi said. ``It was a big
burden I felt when he said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moriguchi, tears overflowing, said she's never forgotten her
brother, who was a large part of her childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a wonderful fellow,'' she said. ``Everywhere he
went, I went with him. He taught me how to skate. We were so
close.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the 120,000 Japanese on the West Coast in 1942, the
Moriguchis were forced from their homes under military order and
sent to inland camps after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Most of
those interned were U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Moriguchis were sent to a camp in Amache, Colo. After a
year, they voluntarily moved to Utah under a program which freed
them from the camp as long as they did not to return to the West
Coast, the prescribed military zone.
</P>
<P>
   Haluto Moriguchi stayed in Amache to finish high school in camp,
then was drafted into the Army. Thousands of Japanese-Americans
volunteered from camps where their families were incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mass internment, which was later called a gross
injustice by the federal courts and two presidents, young Moriguchi
never lost his patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always loved this country _ he always hung a picture of the
American flag in his room,'' June Moriguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The young recruit was sent to France and Italy as a replacement
for the 100th/442, which fought in some of Europe's most horrific
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranks were really depleted,'' said Warren Iwai, 1st
sergeant for Charlie Company, in a phone interview from Hawaii.
``We were getting all these raw recruits, a lot of them from the
mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwai remembered Moriguchi as a cheerful 19-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smiling, had a real sunny personality,'' Iwai said. ``I
asked him if he could splice wire. He said yes. I said, `OK,
Junior, you can stay with me.' The name stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   A month before he was killed, Haluto's father wrote him in neat
script: ``I am glad that you have a good chance to improve to play
pingpong but don't forget to study your books. I see great
opportunity for young people after the war, whether he be an
American or a Japanese. This world is shrinking. There may be less
barriers among the races and countries. I want to see you win not
only at pingpong but also at the game of life.''
</P>
<P>
   His son's death devastated the father, who had dreamed of Haluto
becoming a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crushed when my brother died,'' June Moriguchi said.
``My father's hair turned completely white. He lay in bed for three
weeks. I'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   For years after his death, government benefit checks continued
to arrive in Haluto's name, a sign to his mother that even in
death, he was an ``oyakoko,'' a dutiful child.
</P>
<P>
   Moriguchi's parents have both died. But his family is grateful
he is being remembered.

PHONE WARS: COMPETITORS AT&AMP;T, BELL HAVE LOTS AT STAKE IN
DEREGULATION BILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Southwestern Bell says AT&AMP;T will take its profits back
East if it wins the Texas telephone war. AT&AMP;T says Bell charges
consumers too much to make calls from Midland to Marfa.
</P>
<P>
   But when a telephone deregulation bill is approved by a House
committee in a few days, don't expect AT&AMP;T, Bell or any other Texas
phone company to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter disputes over a bill co-sponsored by state Rep. Toby
Goodman, R-Arlington, are expected to continue as lawmakers try to
make a connection on legislation that they hope will cut telephone
bills, improve service and boost competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has more spin doctors than a presidential
campaign,'' said Goodman, who spent hours co-writing the bill.
``But they are spending tens of millions of dollars on television
because this is a big business deal.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest telecommunication bill to be considered by
Texas lawmakers. The House State Affairs Committee is expected to
vote on it early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is a rewrite of legislation approved by the Senate last
month, and Goodman is a co-author with state Rep. Leticia Van de
Putte, D-San Antonio. The 43-page bill is so complex that Goodman
admits he's been ``going nuts'' over it.
</P>
<P>
   Although time is running out on the legislative session _ it
ends this month _ Rep. Sylvester Turner, the Houston Democrat who
is vice chairman of the State Affairs Committee, predicted that the
House telephone bill will be based on Goodman's version.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, Van de Putte and Rep. Kim Brimer, the Arlington
Republican who is a member of the State Affairs Committee, were to
explain the bill to representatives of the telephone industry and
consumer groups on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman and Van de Putte said their bill is the next step in
telephone deregulation efforts initiated by the House in 1995. That
legislation, which froze local and intrastate access rates, expires
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should decrease your bill if you make (intrastate)
long-distance calls,'' Goodman said. ``This is not a bill that
should increase the cost of telephone service.''
</P>
<P>
   After members of the State Affairs Committee raised concerns
that their bill gave too much to Southwestern Bell, Goodman and Van
de Putte included additional amendments making it tougher on the
telephone giant.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the rates charged by Southwestern Bell are
capped, and the bill forces the company to absorb up to $38 million
a year in providing telephone services to public institutions such
as hospitals and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   During lengthy committee hearings, Van de Putte defended the
bill, saying Bell didn't ask her to write legislation that allowed
the state to take ``$300 million out of (Bell's) pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not enjoyed at all just the slightest inference that
I'm carrying water for Bell. ... I have not enjoyed that,'' said
Van de Putte, who has been accused of protecting Bell, which has
its corportate headquarters in San Antonio and provides telephone
service to about 77 percent of Texas consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is not pleased with everything in the bill, said David
Cole, president of Southwestern Bell-Texas. But being able to
package its services, as they could not before, makes the measure
palatable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving up $300 million; that's a significant financial hit
for us,'' Cole said. ``But if we are able to compete in the same
manner as our competitors are, that's what we are interested in
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending millions of dollars over more than two years
asking for a reduction in access fees, AT&AMP;T officials also are not
happy with the measure.
</P>
<P>
   A grassroots coalition formed by AT&AMP;T, Partnership for a
Competitive Texas, paid for the ads featuring ``Carolyn.'' She
complains that a call from Midland to Marfa costs more than a phone
call to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T wanted the Legislature to do nothing, which would have
allowed the PUC to take control of the rates being charged, said
Vaughn Aldredge, vice president for government affairs at AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   When it appeared that lawmakers were convinced they needed to do
something, AT&AMP;T agreed to the Senate bill allowing Southwestern
Bell less flexibility in setting prices and in packaging its
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the changes, this bill is extremely favorable to
Southwestern Bell and GTE. There is not a balance here yet,''
Aldredge said. ``We thought the Senate bill struck a delicate
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller, independent telephone companies also want to disconnect
Goodman's bill, saying they are getting caught in a squeeze to
please Bell and AT&AMP;T. Allowing Southwestern Bell pricing
flexibility will destroy competition, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They say Goodman's bill will ``emasculate'' the PUC and allow
deregulation of an industry that still needs some regulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tantamount to giving Bell nuclear weapons'' when you
allow Bell and the other telecommunication giants to operate
unregulated, said Royce Holland, chief executive officer of
Allegiance Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups also wonder what, if any, benefit Texans will
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not about saving anybody any money. It's about
which of those companies get their money,'' said Janee
Briesemeister, senior policy analyst at Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Major components of the proposed telephone deregulation bill:
</P>
<P>
   _Limits local and residential basic telephone rates along with
those for call waiting and digital services at current rates until
September 2005, when the state Public Utility Commission will
determine the rates.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, those rates are $9.75 monthly for basic residential
services and about $28 for essential services used by most
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   _Limits what Bell can charge for Caller ID, call return, voice
mail, call forwarding and other services until it enters the
long-distance market or until July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _Grants Bell and GTE the authority to introduce new services and
to ``bundle,'' or offer promotional packages. Previously, state law
has prohibited the companies from ``bundling'' because they are
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   _Establishes how much Bell or GTE can charge to protect
consumers from predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   _Reduces access fees on intrastate long-distance phone calls
from 11.36 cents to 8.36 cents per minute in Bell's service
territory. Bell would lose an estimated $300 million in annual
revenue under this provision.
</P>
<P>
   _Mandates a simpler phone bill that lists three basic charges:
basic, optional, and taxes and surcharges.
</P>

`THE CASTLE': A RHINESTONE THAT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man's home is his you-know-what, even if that home is only a
dilapidated eyesore built on toxic landfill and separated by a
chain-link fence from an airport runway.
</P>
<P>
   But as they say, it's all in the eye of the beholder. And to
Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton), a happy-go-lucky tow-truck driver
and hero of ``The Castle,'' this property is nothing less than an
irreplaceable little patch of heaven on earth, a storehouse of
golden memories.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl and his unflappably cheery brood (he has a wife,
daughter, three sons and several pet greyhounds) are this
Australian movie's sentimentalized version of a John Waters family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Castle,'' a feel-good comic fairy tale that flashes its
family values like an oversize rhinestone bracelet, finds Darryl
enlisting his neighbors in a campaign to save their homes from
demolition when the airport decides to expand. Shortly after an
official appears to assess the area's property values, the
Kerrigans are informed that their house has become a ``compulsory
acquisition'' with a buyout price of $70,000. Darryl decides to
fight back, resisting first bribery, then intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, those wacky, tacky Kerrigans! The movie (and its soundtrack
of smile-button '70s hits like ``We've Only Just Begun'' and ``Make
It With You'') continually dares us to sneer at their garish tastes
and naive assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   As the assessor inspects his home, Darryl proudly points out the
fake chimney, plastic trim and giant television antenna as major
enhancements. Inside is a pool room stuffed with tchotchkes
(including a recently acquired Franklin Mint beer mug) that Darryl
views as priceless heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   In Darryl's rose-colored view, the Kerrigans have the best of
all possible lives. Each night he rapturously oohs and ahs over the
meatloaf and chicken casseroles served by his pretty, perky wife,
Sal (Anne Tenney).
</P>
<P>
   One evening, when he asks her what she did to make the ice cream
so delicious, she replies, ``I scooped it out of the tub.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kerrigans also maintain a dingy summer cottage beside a grim
little lake overlooked by high-voltage power lines. Taking a deep
breath of summer air after a day spent in a motorboat fishing for
carp, Darryl exhales contentedly and rhapsodizes over the fragrant
fumes of diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Castle'' is essentially a one-joke movie, the sheer
giddy stamina with which it insists on the Kerrigans' joie de vivre
keeps it afloat. For his initial courtroom skirmish, Darryl engages
Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora) a local lawyer of spectacular
incompetence and naivete.
</P>
<P>
   In the wittiest scene, this bumbling idiot argues to a
hard-boiled judge that ``the vibes'' of Australia's Constitution
support Darryl's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl ultimately finds a fairy godfather in Lawrence Hammill,
an eloquent retired constitutional lawyer played by Charles (Bud)
Tidwell whom he encounters by chance outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, ``The Castle'' begins to curdle in its own
lurking sentimentality. What is the value of a house versus the
value of a home? Ah, yes, be it ever so humble, and all that. But
``The Castle'' moves along nimbly enough to keep from settling into
a pudding that even Darryl, in all his gastronomic innocence,
couldn't stomach.
</P>
<P>

   More is more, right? More lollipop-colored laser effects, more
glinting buried treasure, more camels with halitosis, more corpses
dancing in the streets. So many famished zombies pop up through the
Egyptian sands in ``The Mummy'' that by the end of this
free-for-all horror spoof the entire dead population of the Nile
basin seems to have risen from the grave. One militant faction of
the undead even marches around in chorus line formation awaiting
instructions on which side to take.
</P>
<P>
   Should they destroy the pushy young explorers who have
recklessly invaded the recesses of Hamunaptra, a vast legendary
Egyptian crypt under the Saharan sands? Or should they turn on
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a shiny-pated, beady-eyed priest who
having spent the last three millennia in a living death being
slowly eaten alive by scarab beetles is understandably cranky?
Imhotep, who morphs from a clammy, anorexic Godzilla into a bearish
lout who resembles Kojak's younger brother, knows how to throw a
serious hissy fit. When miffed, he can gather himself into a
swirling sandstorm and swallow an airplane. Or he take a deep
breath and exhale an impromptu plague of locusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy,'' directed by Stephen Sommers, bills itself as ``a
full-scale reimagining'' of the 1932 horror classic in which Boris
Karloff plays a resuscitated mummy stalking a pretty English girl
he believes to be the reincarnation of his long-lost sweetheart. In
the remake, still set in the mid-1920s, he sets his sights on
Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), a plucky English librarian who plumbs the
mysteries of Hamunaptra with her twitty elder brother, Jonathan
(John Hannah), and Rick (Brendan Fraser), an American adventurer
who stumbled upon the burial site while rattling around Egypt
(really Morocco) with the foreign legion.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's Rick is a flaky chip off Harrison Ford's block.
Easygoing and indestructible, he tosses off bluff, cartoon-balloon
quips while blithely hacking at the limbs of the zombies hurling
themselves at him with kamikaze-like fury. His exclamations make
Ford's throwaway remarks in the Indiana Jones films seem positively
Shakespearean in their depth and rationality.
</P>
<P>
   This version of ``The Mummy'' has no pretenses to be anything
other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with cartoon characters, no coherent
story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think ``Night of
the Living Dead'' stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an
Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think ``Abbott and Costello Meet
the Mummy'' grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (``The
Road to Hamunaptra''?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof.
</P>
<P>
   Being a parody gives ``The Mummy'' license to indulge whatever
farcical whims come into its empty head, but the shocks tend to be
stock jack-in-the-box surprises and trap-door pratfalls. As for
creepiness, the one special effect that gets under your skin, as it
were, involves swarms of lustrous scarabs. The creatures that have
been nibbling at Imhotep's entrails for 3,000 years hide in
luminescent gemlike casings. If you are foolish enough to pry one
open, out pops a shiny black beetle that immediately burrows under
your skin and begins hungrily zipping around your body (think
``Alien'').
</P>
<P>
   These demonic creatures are the most entertaining element of
``The Mummy.'' If you want to play a computer game that involves
evading the beetles, it's waiting for you on the Internet at
``themummy.com.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Mummy'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). Although some of the horror effects may scare young
children, its shock effects are mild, its gore minimal.

`THE EMPTY MIRROR': HITLER MEETS FREUD ON A BLOOD-RED COUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adolf Hitler may have been many things, but it seems unlikely
that he was the colossal bore portrayed in the hyperthyroid
hodgepodge of pseudo-psychotherapy called ``The Empty Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   This film appears to proceed on the assumption that if the
screen is splattered with enough images of a ranting actor,
documentary film footage of the Nazi era and World War II, torrents
of viscous blood, Aryan Rhinemaidens out of a fever dream,
suggestions of sexual dysfunction and youthful trauma, a brunette
brandishing a dagger and a jailer ominously tapping a club,
Hitler's psyche will be laid as bare as a nut from its shell.
</P>
<P>
   To help matters along, toss in lots of flames, the sage of
Vienna, Sigmund Freud, and an assortment of Richard Wagner's
greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse kind of historical justice, the petard that hoists
this misguided project is the Fuhrer himself. Seen in clips from
Leni Riefenstahl's notorious documentary ``Triumph of the Will,''
the charismatic Hitler who bent a nation to his purpose
effortlessly pales poor Norman Rodway, the English actor whose
misfortune is to be saddled with trying to reveal history with
histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped in this film, directed by Barry J. Hershey from a
screenplay by Hershey and R. Buckingham, are Joel Grey, playing
Josef Goebbels as a cross between a simpering sycophant and a
talking history text for those who came late to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Shadix perpetuates the image of Hermann Goring as the
Fatso in a perception of Nazism as some sort of comic opera. Doug
McKeon plays the pitiable military typist who has to listen to
Hitler's logorrhea as he dictates his memoirs, and the Swedish
actress Camilla Soeberg portrays Eva Braun.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Empty Mirror'' much style delivers little substance.

`THIS IS MY FATHER': A FAMILY STORY _ IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This Is My Father'' follows a Chicago schoolteacher and his
teen-age nephew back to their Irish homeland, where the latter
strikes the fancy of a couple of schoolgirls. ``Is it true every
American has a gun?'' they ask him jokingly. And: ``Do you know any
murderers?'' The boy mentions an acquaintance who shot and killed a
teacher in math class. This scene may mean to be facetious, but it
stands out painfully in the midst of an otherwise gentle,
picturesque romance.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed with obvious sincerity by Paul Quinn,
``This Is My Father'' casts a glum James Caan as an Irish-American
in search of his roots, with Jacob Tierney as his engaging nephew.
Then it flashes back to 1939, when the family was much more
interesting. The story centers on the romance between pretty,
impetuous 17-year-old Fiona Flynn (Moya Farrelly) and a shy
orphaned farmer who is several years her senior. In the village
where the film takes place, the farmer is discussed so dismissively
that ``the likes of Kieran O'Day'' seems to be his full name.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran O'Day is played with conviction by Aidan Quinn, the
director's brother, in a film that is as much a family story as the
one told onscreen. The cinematographer is a third Quinn brother,
Declan, whose triumphs include ``Leaving Las Vegas'' and ``Vanya on
42nd Street.'' This time, he gives the Irish landscape a deep-hued
radiance, in contrast to the drab Chicago scenes that open the
story.
</P>
<P>
   All three brothers are co-executive producers of Paul's first
feature. They give a knowing wink to the stock Irish figures who
abound here, and also give this tale the doomy inevitability of an
Irish ballad.
</P>
<P>
   Armed only with a snapshot of his mother and her unknown beau,
the teacher arrives at a bed-and-breakfast and persuades an aged
fortuneteller (Moira Deady) to give him clues to his father's
identity. The old woman introduces the film's main story in a long,
enveloping flashback. She explains how Kieran O'Day was a tenant
farmer on land owned by Fiona's malevolent mother (Gina Moxley),
and how the mother fought to keep Fiona away from him. The
fortuneteller also manages to summon many details about village
life, from the memory of a dance at the temperance hall to the way
Fiona was called ``Hussy!'' by disapproving neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By way of bringing the community to life, the film casts some
stellar Irish actors in what are essentially cameo roles. Colm
Meaney does his usual scene-stealing as the fortuneteller's happily
conniving son, while Brendan Gleeson has only the tiny role of a
local policeman. Stephen Rea, as a visiting priest who means to
reprimand Fiona and Kieran for their flirtation, solemnly satirizes
a clergyman too interested in his parishioners' carnal secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The film sometimes uses its cameos too desperately, as when John
Cusack turns up in a seaplane. He plays a Life magazine
photographer who arrives to take a picture of the lovers at just
the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   The film's taste for such coincidences winds up diminishing the
power of its final revelations. And events that ought to prompt
strong emotion begin feeling like plot contrivances too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the actors, especially Aidan Quinn, move through this story
in quietly impassioned style and do what they can to override its
hackneyed elements. In its heartfelt, slightly awkward way, ``This
Is My Father'' means to be as evocative as the romantic old
photograph that sets it in motion. &QL;

helmet. A deck chair from ``Titanic.'' Vivien Leigh's coat from
``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   These bits of American movie history, which are making their way
around the country as part of the American Film Institute's
traveling exhibit, make their only L.A. stop today through Sunday
at the Los Cerritos Mall. This celebration of the movies also
features a mini-theater showing clips from the AFI's list of top
100 films, a 3-D scene from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' an animatronic
Bogart, plenty of costumes and a photo opportunity in ``Jurassic
Park'' or a scene from a classic motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to showcasing the past, the roving exhibit also
includes forward-looking displays of high-definition television and
Web TV. The AFI is also promoting its three-hour CBS special on
June 15 titled ``100 Years ... 100 Stars'' the AFI's follow-up to
last year's 100 top American films special. This year's list of 50
screen legends will be presented by 50 current Hollywood stars.

   ASIA MAJOR: A grab bag of feature films, world premieres,
dramas, documentaries and shorts by Asian and Asian-American
filmmakers is there for the taking at the 14th annual Los Angeles
Asian Pacific Film &AMP; Video Festival, which opens Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three films are making their world premieres: ``Freshmen'' by
Tom Huang, a character-driven story about four young collegians who
struggle with new-found personal freedom and their pasts; ``Catfish
in Black Bean Sauce'' by Chi Muoi Lo, a dramatic family comedy
about two Vietnamese children raised in an African-American home;
and ``Much Adobo About Nothing'' by Dom Magwili and Stann Nakazono,
a screwball comedy that examines modern Asian-American attitudes on
romance.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which runs through May 20 at the Directors Guild
of America and the Japan America Theatre, begins at 7:30 p.m.
Thursday with the Los Angeles premiere of ``Life Tastes Good,'' the
directorial debut of playwright Philip Kan Gotanda, at the DGA.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled are Keibo Ibi's Academy Award-winning documentary
about a senior-citizen acting troupe, titled ``The Personals:
Improvisations on Romance in the Golden Years''; and Barbara
Sonnenborn's Oscar-nominated documentary, ``Regret to Inform,'' in
which the director returns to Vietnam, where her husband, Jeff,
lost his life, and encounters other war widows.
</P>
<P>
   Lela Lee and her animated character, Angry Little Asian Girl,
are back with a new installment titled ``Hi There!''
</P>
<P>
   Workshops with tips on breaking into the film business,
discussions of recent successes and a discussion with Peter Chan
(``He's a Woman, She's a Man'' and ``Comrades: Almost a Love
Story'') are scheduled. Chan will preview his newest film for
DreamWorks, ``The Love Letter,'' starring Kate Capshaw, at the May
15 ``Afternoon With a Filmmaker'' program at the Directors Guild of
America Theatre. New this year is a segment focusing on cinema from
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   From director Dail Sil Kim-Gibson comes a treatise about a
painful chapter in modern Asian history titled ``Silence Broken:
Korean Comfort Women.'' The film explores the degradation and shame
brought upon Korean women who were held as sex slaves in World War
II for Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The closing night feature, ``The Bird People of China'' by Miike
Takashi, centers around an uptight white-collar worker, a
bad-tempered hit man and a forgetful guide (played by Mako) as they
wander the mountains looking for a fortune in jade and a mythical
village. ``The Bird People'' will screen at the Japan America
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild of America is at 7920 Sunset Blvd., Los
Angeles. The Japan America Theatre is at 244 S. San Pedro St. in
downtown's Little Tokyo. Tickets for festival events are $8.50
general admission and $6.50 for students and seniors. Closing-night

`THE SENT DOWN GIRL': RELEGATED TO THE HINTERLANDS, A CHINESE
GIRL'S SPIRIT IS BATTERED BY THE REVOLUTON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl,'' a tragic story spun out of
China's Cultural Revolution, has irritated the Chinese authorities
not just because it was made surreptitiously and without official
approval, but because of its damning assessment of Mao Zedong's
grandiose experiment in mass indoctrination.
</P>
<P>
   That radical exercise in social engineering, conducted from 1966
to 1976, involved the relocation of nearly eight million Chinese
young people from cities to the country's remote provinces for
specialized (often agricultural) training.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal was to eradicate lingering class distinctions by
forcing everyone to join the proletarian labor force. The film
portrays that experiment as a colossal failure, ineptly carried out
and steeped in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by the Chinese actress Joan Chen, who adapted the
screenplay with Yan Geling from Ms. Yan's novella ``Tian Yu''
(``Celestial Bath''), ``Xiu Xiu'' is not explicitly
autobiographical, even though Ms. Chen, a respected Chinese
actress, grew up in China during those years.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Wen Xiu (nicknamed Xiu Xiu), a tailor's teen-age
daughter transported from her home city of Chengdu to the Tibetan
plains to learn horse herding, is narrated by a young male admirer
whom Xiu Xiu meets shortly before her departure. In his account of
her life, pieced together from anecdotes, Xiu Xiu's fate assumes an
almost operatic fatefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Xiu Xiu's equestrian training is supposed to prepare her for
membership in the Iron Girls' Cavalry. But during the time she
spends on the plains living in a tent with her teacher and guide,
Lao Jin (Lopsang), she spends a lot more time gazing into a
kaleidoscope the young man gave her than on learning to tame
horses.
</P>
<P>
   A silent loner and true nomad, emasculated during the war with
Tibet, Lao Jin has only two possessions: a cheap, battered portable
radio that he rarely plays and a gold tooth made from his mother's
melted-down earrings.
</P>
<P>
   On the day her six-month training period is to end, Xiu Xiu
(pronounced ``show show'') dresses up and waits for a local
administrator to appear and accompany her home. But no one comes.
More days pass.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a handsome peddler arrives and gives her the
discouraging news that the girls' cavalry has been disbanded and
that only young people who are politically well-connected have been
allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   After promising to use his connections at the local headquarters
to help Xiu Xiu, he seduces her and departs the next day. Xiu Xiu
eagerly awaits his return. But instead of coming back, he directs a
succession of soldiers and bureaucrats to her tent where they take
advantage of her desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the months together, Xiu Xiu and Lao Jin have developed a
silent, deepening bond that is sealed in one final, courageous act
of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a secondhand tale told by someone imagining what
happened, the harsher aspects of the story are softened by the
movie's allegorical perspective. As much as the film sympathizes
with Xiu Xiu's plight, it never delves into her soul.
</P>
<P>
   The rigors of the climate and of Xiu Xiu's austere outdoor life
are de-emphasized by the film, which prefers to drink in the
desolate beauty of the landscape and to concentrate on symbolic
visual portents. The demure poetic distance the film maintains from
its brutal physical facts mutes the impact of the story. Instead of
devastating, ``Xiu Xiu'' is merely sad. &QL;

ANTIQUES: PLEASE DON'T PET THE CHINESE DRAGON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans see animals as pets. The Chinese see them as
everything else: emblems of the four directions of the compass and
symbols of longevity, good luck, protection and love of virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been molding, carving or painting real and
mythical animals since the Neolithic period, circa 6500 to 1700
B.C. In a recent show, ``China: 5,000 Years,'' the Guggenheim
Museum displayed jade birds and pig-dragon ornaments from the
Hongshan culture (3600 to 2000 B.C.) and elephants and rams
adorning bronze pots from the Shang period (1600 to 1100 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Christie's Los Angeles is holding an auction, ``Myth
and Reality: Animals in Chinese Art,'' which includes a
three-legged Shang bronze vessel decorated with dragons and
cicadas. The piece is one of 112 lots that Christie's Chinese-art
specialist, Michael Hughes, has assembled, with, he said, ``animals
in a variety of media from various periods.'' The jade, bronze,
porcelain and painted animals all share one attribute: charm.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary E. Scott, a former professor of Chinese art at London
University who is now a consultant to Christie's in London, said in
an interview: ``Animals were important to the Chinese from the very
early times. Animals were not only to hunt with or provide food;
they were also seen as symbolic. They were tied to ritual and
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the Bronze Age, animals are seen as intermediaries between
humans and the spirit world. Animals were guardians of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog for the sale, Ms. Scott writes: ``Animals and
birds are frequently symbols in Chinese culture, and no distinction
is made between real animals and those of mythological origin. The
creatures of the Chinese zodiac, for instance, include 11 real
animals: rat, ox, tiger, hare, snake, horse, goat, monkey, cock,
dog and pig, with one mythological animal: the dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that dragons and cicadas decorate the bronze
vessel in the sale. ``Dragons are always good,'' Ms. Scott said in
the interview. ``They become a symbol of the emperor and power
later on. They scare away bad things.'' The cicada symbolizes
immortality and resurrection because it metamorphosizes from a
larva to a winged insect. ``Naturalistic images of animals were
felt to have supernatural powers,'' Ms. Scott added.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel is expected to bring in $35,000 to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the sale is a beautiful round bronze weight from the
Warring States Period (475 to 221 B.C.), which depicts a tiger
mauling a fallen deer. The tiger has wrestled the deer to earth,
its left paw holding down one antler while it twists around to bite
the deer's neck. The tiger is inlaid with gold markings; the deer
has inlaid silver ``fur.'' The eyes of both are inset with amber
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lally, the president of J.J. Lally &AMP; Co. Oriental Art in New
York, said such weights were used to anchor the shrouds of the dead
during this period. ``They usually came in sets of four,'' he said.
``The tiger attacking a deer was a fashionable subject,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Han times, Ms. Scott said, ``the tiger was regarded as
the king of wild creatures and symbolized the ruler and unlimited
power, as well as courage, dignity and military powess.''
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of the Song Dynasty (A.D. 960 to 1279), such
weights were named scroll weights, because they held down hand
scrolls as they were unwound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became a rich man's luxury object,'' Lally said. ``The
$20,000 to $40,000 estimate seems sensible for an object that's
2,500 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220) is represented in the
sale by a 30-inch-long pottery tortoise that looks as if it could
outrun the hare. It has personality. Its massive carapace is carved
in a diamond pattern. There is a knobby ridge along its back, and
its head is extended, eyes bulging, mouth partly open.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times in China, a dark warrior, a combination of
tortoise and snake, symbolized the North, Ms. Scott said. The green
dragon represented the East, the white tiger the West, and the red
bird the South.
</P>
<P>
   Tortoises and turtles are also associated with longevity. The
pottery tortoise is expected to sell for $50,000 to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Faberge-like in size and style are two small rock crystal bears
from the Han Dynasty. Each is crouching with its right knee raised
and its left tucked beneath the body. The fur ruffs are incised.
The mouths are animated, as if growling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hardly ever see any rock crystal bears before the 18th
century,'' Lally said. It is extremely unusual to have rock crystal
bears from the Han, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lally, who recently sold a similar bear, said all three might
have come from one tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually none of them were known until one burial came to
light,'' he said. ``Then many appeared on the market in one go. No
one knows the significance of the bear's posture, but it became
conventional as bears became caryatids to support vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking porcelains in the sale is a blue and
white pear-shaped vase from the Yuan Dynasty (1279 to 1368 A.D.).
It has two vividly painted, prancing mythical qilins racing across
it. Anyone who drinks Kirin beer from Japan will recognize this
mythical animal from the beer label; kirin means qilin in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   A qilin has the head of a goat, the hooves of an ox, the horns
and body of a deer, the scaly skin of the dragon and a leonine
tail. Its body emits stylized flames.
</P>
<P>
   The qilin was meant to be a gentle creature that treads so
lightly it leaves no footprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It damages no living thing,'' the Christie's catalog says.
``Symbolizing, among other virtues, prosperity and wise
administration, the qilin only appears during the reign of a noble
and honorable ruler.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally called the qilin ``an auspicious beast,'' adding: ``He has
flames flying off his flanks. It is a good animal to have on your
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is $50,000 to $70,000. ``If it were in perfect
condition, it would be $200,000,'' Lally said.

</P>
<P>
   Other pieces in the sale carry more modest estimates. A
12-inch-long painted pottery boar from the Han Dynasty, which looks
like a piece of American folk art, is estimated at $1,000 to
$2,000. The wild boar, which symbolizes the richness of the forests
where it lived, is a favorite subject in Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
   So is the domesticated pig. One striking example, also from the
Han, is a very pregnant sow. Ears out and snout raised, the
20-inch-long pig has a swollen body, with nipples almost touching
the ground. Estimate: $10,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Chinese collector, the symbolism of animals in a work
of art is always a secondary concern,'' Lally said. ``For us, it's
fascinating to know how it was viewed at the time it was made and
what power or symbol it was meant to embody. Part of the pleasure
of owning an ancient piece is to place it in context. You don't
have to be superstitious to love having an auspicious animal
around.''

CAT IN HAT MEETS HULK

   &UR; And it happened that both of them came to a place where they
bumped. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There they stood. &LR;

   ORLANDO, Fla. _ As I scanned the glowering three-foot-high
concrete figures locked in each other's baleful gaze, they became a
metaphor for a larger battle that is taking shape in Orlando, Fla.
After a decade of living in the shadow of Walt Disney World,
Universal is beginning to position itself as a competitor, if not
an equal, to the colossus down the road.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening this spring of the 110-acre Islands of
Adventure, five years in the making, and a 30-acre dining and
entertainment complex called City Walk (plus three luxury hotels
that will place 2,400 rooms on the property by 2001), Universal is
the first Disney wannabe to directly challenge Disney as a
principal Orlando destination.
</P>
<P>
   When added to the existing nine-year-old theme park _ Universal
Studios Florida _ the attractions will more than double its size.
The new entity, now collectively called Universal Studios Escape,
is estimated to have cost $2.6 billion. But the expansion has to be
measured by more than just acres and dollars. The changes will
allow Universal, a unit of Seagram, to market Escape
internationally as a three- or four-day vacation where visitors can
eat, sleep and enjoy the theme parks without leaving the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the new attractions have strengthened Universal's
position as a mecca for high-voltage adventure rides as well as
attracting the kiddie-family crowd that has been a Disney franchise
since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we're going after the Magic Kingdom
crowd,'' said Thomas L. Williams, president of Universal Studios
Escape. ``There's going to be a lot more fun stuff for the kids as
well as the most technologically advanced, story-driven thrill
rides in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thrill'' in this case might be an understatement. On a visit
during a sneak preview in April, I rode in the front seat of the
Incredible Hulk, a steel roller coaster on Marvel Super Hero
Island, one of the five man-made theme ``islands'' that make up
Islands of Adventure. The others are Seuss Landing, the Lost
Continent, Jurassic Park and Toon Lagoon. Hulk is a psychically
bruising upside-down, twist-and-drop experience that made the
wooden-track roller coasters of my youth _ like the venerable
Cyclone on Coney Island _ seem like a rowboat ride in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   This $15 million Swiss-made devil launches passengers strapped
in a 32-seat vehicle up rails on an enclosed 30-degree ramp,
accelerating from a rolling start to 40 miles an hour in 2 seconds.
Park officials say the propulsion's G-force is the same as
experienced by an F-16 pilot on takeoff. At the top of the ramp the
vehicle whips out into the open air and turns nearly upside down,
giving riders a momentary weightless sensation before plummeting
110 feet. The next two minutes on the 3,000-foot track is an
unrelenting series of towering loops, drop-dead plunges and
sideways careerings.
</P>
<P>
   After the dizzying experience, I walked away in a straight line,
but the following day I felt a twinge of vertigo whenever I bent
over to tie my shoes or lie down.
</P>
<P>
   After that, a chance to ride Dueling Dragons _ a similar
computer-controlled coaster that launches two sets of cars on dual
overhead tracks, so riders' legs dangle beneath them as they fly
upside-down and sideways before the vehicles barely miss at 60
miles an hour _ was easy to pass up, even though it lasts only 50
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Universal also has perfected in-your-face assaults on the senses
in its new ``dark rides,'' attractions housed entirely within
buildings that give visitors the visceral impression they are
battling comic book villains, futuristic aliens or prehistoric
monsters. In some of these rides, special glasses and 3-D films
heighten the effects.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, which moves on a track
inside a 1.5-acre set, is billed as the most technologically
advanced dark ride in existence. Riders are loaded into cars that
sweep them into a fast-moving urban scene where the webby hero in
red and blue tights appears to leap onto the front of the vehicle,
followed by a succession of evil malefactors, including the
tentacled Dr. Octopus. A whirling spin above city towers culminates
with a wild 400-foot crash dive into a street, which made me blink
hard and hold tight though I knew it all was a 3-D illusion. The
car moves all right, dipping and rising and pitching forward, even
as it moves along on the track. Twenty-five large format movie
projectors and even more smaller ones cast a panoramic action
environment laden with quick movement, flashing scenes and
clamorous sounds that block reality and _ in conjunction with the
short but quick movements of the car _ seduce the brain into buying
the story line. After two days of all this I was
adrenaline-depleted.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, Universal will open Men in Black, a
80,000-square-foot dark ride based on the hit film of the same name
about alien hunters, that Universal says will outdo Spider-Man.
``We define the Universal brand of entertainment as being on the
cutting edge of technology and creativity,'' said Mark Woodbury,
the company's vice president for design and creative development.
``We do our storytelling with icons of popular culture like Dr.
Seuss, E.T. and Marvel Comics super heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more separates Universal and Disney than the 15 miles
between the two Florida resorts. In a way, both are heirs to
escapist formulas identified with each studio in their early years.
Disney offered light, airy and sentimental family entertainment
that charmed and delighted. Universal produced hair-raising
monsters and shrieks. Disney gave the public Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck; Universal set loose Frankenstein's monster and
Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney World made its debut at the height of the Cold War,
Vietnam and urban unrest, when escape to light fantasy was a
welcome respite, just as its most famous characters enchanted
audiences during the Depression and World War II. Universal opened
its Florida gates as the Cold War ended, domestic calm reigned, and
computer technology was revolutionizing popular entertainment. Even
the brief Persian Gulf war whetted some American appetites for
laser-guided fantasies and games of futuristic conflict. And
Universal has benefited greatly from its association with Steven
Spielberg, a creative consultant, whose hits like ``Jaws,''
``E.T.'' and ``Jurassic Park'' translate easily into popular theme
park rides.
</P>

<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The expanded park thus squarely sets up the competition between
Universal's established muscular appeal and Disney's. The next
step, going after the family segment and establishing a high-end
resort business, is the real challenge to Universal in its
high-stakes expansion. Neither company releases attendance figures,
but Amusement Business, a trade publication, estimated 1998
attendance at Universal Studios at 8.9 million, about one-third of
what Disney World draws.
</P>
<P>
   Disney World has added a number of thrill rides recently but
maintains the moves were the result of public demand, not a
response to Universal. ``We wish Universal success, but our focus
is on the explosive growth at this property,'' said Rick Sylvain, a
Disney spokesman. Disney's thrill rides include the Tower of Terror
at Disney-MGM Studios, a milelong test track ride at the Epcot
General Motors attraction, and a steel-track roller coaster with
multiple inversions due this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Islands of Adventure opens to the public this month, and the
first big hotel development, the 750-room Portofino Bay, is now
taking reservations for stays that begin Sept. 1 (rates start at
$245 a night). But annual pass holders and large numbers of tour
groups, mainly from Britain and for the most part under age 50,
have been admitted in recent weeks. Those I talked with seemed
generally impressed, even amazed, by the total experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, wow, wow!'' exclaimed a man walking out of Spider-Man
with a face flushed by the Florida sun and the ride. ``I've never
seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The park's compactness _ the three sections are an easy walk
from one another, compared with the bus, monorail or car rides that
link the Disney attractions _ is an advantage for those with
limited time. Visitors now enter the attractive City Walk
development on people-movers streaming from two garages that can
hold 19,000 cars. To the right lies Universal Studios and to the
left is Islands of Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   City Walk, inspired by the attraction of the same name at
Universal Studios in Los Angeles, has dozens of retail shops, clubs
and restaurants, and is free. There is a variety of food, jazz and
other live music at places like Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, the
Hard Rock Cafe and Motown Cafe, and fine dining at Emeril's,
operated by the celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, and the Latin
Quarter, a restaurant with special appeal to visitors from Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   A 130-foot-tall lighthouse inspired by the ancient wonder at
Alexandria marks the entrance to Islands of Adventure (admission
$42) at Port of Entry, where curio shops, colorful street
characters and sinuous music are designed to convey the mystery of
a romantic place like Zanzibar. The five islands lie immediately
ahead, around a large lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   I took the circular path going to the right into Seuss Landing,
a whimsical collection of structures with no sharp angles, painted
in bright colors. A large carousel with 54 mounts based on Dr.
Seuss animals carries young riders who can activate functions that
wiggle noses and wag tails. Even live palm trees seem bent by
Seussian forces. Actually, they are survivors of Hurricane Andrew
in 1992 in South Florida, many obtained from nurseries that could
not sell their misshapen trunks. A Cat in the Hat patrols the
streets under his bent stovepipe, and small children and their
parents can take a four-minute ride named after the character,
accompanied by bouncy music and recorded text from the story. Exits
_ after a few spins at the ride's end _ are made through a gift
shop that, among other articles, sells a Cat in the Hat costume for
$28. A quick bite is available at the Green Eggs and Ham Cafe, with
the namesake dish prepared with spinach and parsley, park officials
assured me.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on the counterclockwise route is The Lost
Continent, starring the Dueling Dragons double coaster, the
Poseidon's Fury adventure ride and another called The Eighth Voyage
of Sinbad. Jurassic Park follows with a learning center describing
DNA sequencing in elementary terms, play areas and lifelike
animatronic dinosaurs. The first-rate river adventure ends with a
sharply angled 85-foot water slide that saves riders from a
Tyrannosaurus Rex (at the price of soaking their clothes and
cameras).
</P>
<P>
   For nature-minded visitors, the star of the island is the lush
vegetation creating a 25-acre ``prehistoric'' rain forest with
4,000 palm trees. At Toon Lagoon, there's Popeye's oversized tug
boat to clamber aboard, Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls flume ride
and a virtual history of the comics with live shows and other
tributes to characters ranging from Krazy Kat to Hagar the
Horrible. The last stop is Marvel Super Hero Island. And if
Spider-Man and The Hulk haven't done you in, you can try Doctor
Doom's Fearfall, in which seated passengers are blasted up the
sides of 200-foot-high structures, rapidly dropped to the base and
blasted up again _ something like a rigid bungee jump. I passed.  &QL;

   Tracy is all facial expression (wonderfully managed by Ms.
Witherspoon) and voice, which is often lifted in shrill blasts of
resolve. When not grinning maniacally during photo opportunities,
her expression is one of fierce, furrow-browed determination, with
eyes narrowed to slits at displeasure and lips ever pursed to spout
the next bromide about morals and ethics and the call to
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Carver High has a budding monster on its hands, a
preciously high-minded teacher named Jim McAllister (Broderick)
decides it is imperative to find someone to run against Tracy and
derail the Flick express. That would be Paul Metzler (Klein), a
quarterback hero type with the manner of a sheepish schoolboy,
which he is.
</P>
<P>
   But then the race gets a wild card: Paul's feisty little sister,
Tammy (Ms. Campbell), who is wrestling with personal issues and
wants to head government simply so she can dismantle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president I won't do anything,'' she tells an assembly.
That gets a standing ovation. Tracy, by contrast, sounds more and
more like she has a future inside the Beltway. Time for desperate
measures. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX The fact that boys and girls, as well as their teachers and
parents, are involved in a variety of sexual activities is always
apparent if not depicted. (There is also a bit of frontal nudity,
albeit in a museum exhibit.) &QL;

sudden, strong bursts, which is done for effect. &QL;

<P>
   AGES 10-12 Parents might well object to the language and sexual
situations. &QL;

<P>
   Directed by Jeff Pollack &QL;

<P>
   PG-13 98 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A scrawny restaurateur named Dylan (Spade) needs to obtain a
bank loan and get a life. An annoyingly self-deprecating
professional twerp, he has honed his woes into a shtick, right down
to a cutesy poor-me patois full of lame jokes that poke snide,
phony fun at himself and others.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with women are chronic, but one day he is run into and
flattened by a beautiful cellist named Lila Dubois (Ms. Marceau).
Lila has a little dust mop of a dog named Jack, who is always
running off. Dylan decides to keep retrieving Jack as a device to
see Lila.
</P>
<P>
   Why she would have any interest in such a person is a tough plot
element to sell even in a Hollywood fantasy as ridiculous as this
one. Lila, though, has her own troubles having to do with a stalled
career and a boorish former boyfriend (Bruel), a big-time pianist
who comes from France to win her back. Perhaps she is just
distracted enough to put up with Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   They share a gambol or two and trade reflections on life. Then
the dog swallows a diamond ring, meaning that Dylan has to kidnap
him long enough for the gem to pass through his digestive track.
Naturally, mounds of excrement are carefully probed.
</P>
<P>
   On the financial front, the bank president (Sheen) holds out on
the loan. But Dylan counters with an amazingly bad Neil Diamond
impersonation, which amuses the banker's wife. Loan approved. That
still leaves problems with Lila. Don't ask. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX There are a few partly clothed situations and many off-color
allusions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A moderate amount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 There is a dog, but this is a limp, sour film with
nothing to recommend itself to young children.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP It's hard to imagine teen-agers having any
interest in a movie that from its humor to its situations is as
flat as this one. &QL;

<P>
   What happens? It's hard to describe in linear terms but Ronna
(Ms. Polley), who is a check-out person at a supermarket, fills in
for Simon (Askew), who has gone to Las Vegas with some friends.
When Adam (Wolf) and Zack (Mohr) come in looking for drugs, Ronna
procures some from Todd (Olyphant). But there is an altercation
over payment and Todd seeks out Ronna, who's now selling baby
aspirin to a van full of teen-agers who are expecting something a
little stronger.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas Simon suddenly develops incredible sexual prowess
and sets a hotel room on fire. Later he shoots a lap-dance parlor
proprietor and gets into problems with people who chase him and his
friends all the way back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While that is going on, Zack and Adam, a gay couple, are part of
a police sting supervised by an officer who is also trying to
recruit them as salesmen for Confederated Products, an Amway-type
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Be assured that all of this fits together, and wryly so, after
circling back to the place where it started with Ronna at her post
at the check-out counter. Organized in sections like Quentin
Tarantino's ``Pulp Fiction,'' Liman's film continually poses
questions that are cleared up in due course and in consistently
amusing fashion. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So after three hours and 15 minutes in the wilds of
New England with orphans and abortionists, prostitutes and health
nuts, cranky old trainmen, stout-hearted nurses and mischievous
tomboys, are you up for another three?
</P>
<P>
   This seems a perfectly reasonable question to ponder at the
conclusion of the Atlantic Theater Company's presentation of Part
One of ``The Cider House Rules,'' since this often frisky
adaptation of John Irving's rangy 1985 novel ends smack dab in the
middle of Irving's tale.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic has opted for the time being to offer only the
first half of the sprawling production, directed by Tom Hulce and
Jane Jones, that was first presented at nonprofit theaters on the
West Coast. The two-part stagings ranged in duration from seven
hours at the Seattle Rep to a pared-down six-plus-change at the
Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A novelistic drama that so baldly tests an audience's endurance
must strive to be at least as engrossing as the book on which it is
based; theatergoers need some justification for bypassing the
express and hopping on the local. And in the long run ``The Cider
House Rules,'' it's distressing to report, does not provide it.
Although the ride progresses on a smooth trackbed of noble
intentions, one arrives at the end of Part One (subtitled ``Here in
St. Cloud's'') relieved to disembark. In the workmanlike treatment
by Hulce and Ms. Jones of Peter Parnell's blueprint of a script,
not only does three hours and 15 minutes of gallivanting in Maine
prove to be enough, it's more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt ``The Cider House Rules,'' with its luxurious
digressions, confident pacing and doubling and tripling of roles
for 19 actors _ a teeming horde by Off Broadway standards _ will
have its partisans. As consumers, Americans have a weakness for
things that come in big packages; whether it's buying in bulk or
sitting through bulky movies, we are susceptible to the notion that
more is more.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, more can indeed be more: ``The Life and Adventures
of Nicholas Nickleby,'' the eight-and-a-half-hour dramatization of
the Dickens novel by the Royal Shakespeare Company, was one of the
great theatrical coups of the last quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the evident care that has gone into the production,
``Cider House,'' which opened last night, is no ``Nickleby.'' Not
that it was required of the adapters of Irving's novel to imitate
the 1981 Broadway hit in all of its particulars. (Even if the
Irving novel, and the play, allude frequently to Dickens.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cider House'' comes up short because it fails at a
critical task, and one that ``Nickleby'' accomplished brilliantly:
the creation of a vital corps of indelible characters who allowed
audiences to live in the play with them. Dickens' people grew and
shriveled before our eyes; their quirks and vanities and
compulsions were revealed to us, not dictated to us, as those of
Irving's characters seem to be. It is as if the one production
emerged from the truth of the heart, and the other from mere
hearsay.
</P>
<P>
   The shortcomings of this ``Cider House,'' in fact, seem to
mirror those of two of its minor characters, the Winkles, a lusty
couple of fresh-air enthusiasts, played by Martin Moran and Cynthia
Darlow, who are prospective adoptive parents for Homer Wells (Josh
Hamilton), the play's orphan-hero.
</P>
<P>
   The Winkles are robust and good-natured, but all their better
impulses come to naught; intrepid swimmers, they drown after they
fail to discern the rumble of a log drive unleashed by a lumber
mill upriver. The production, too, is infused with a certain brio,
yet there is a tone deafness when it comes to the emotional
universe in which its characters are supposed to dwell.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Nickleby,'' too, the story of ``Cider House'' is laid
out on a broad canvas with minimal scenery _ David Zinn's
understated costumes and John Arnone's double-decker clapboard set
convey the pleasing serenity of a Quaker meetinghouse _ and the
speaking part of omniscient narrator is passed on from actor to
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the time is the 1920s and '30s, the sensibility is
unmistakably late 20th century: the production, like the novel, is
an attempt to frame on both epic and human scale a contemporary
pair of issues, abortion and adoption.
</P>
<P>
   This ambition is embodied by the play's two central characters,
Homer and Dr. Wilbur Larch (Colm Meaney). Wilbur is an
obstetrician-turned-abortionist who runs the St. Cloud's orphanage,
the setting for much of Part One of ``The Cider House Rules'' _ the
title refers to a locale in the second half of the novel. Homer is
a gentle and questioning orphan who after several failed adoptive
tryouts becomes a ward of St. Cloud's and the presumptive son to
the steady and principled Wilbur.
</P>
<P>
   The adapters of ``Cider House'' gamble heavily on our emotional
investment in Homer and Wilbur; an extended flashback to Wilbur's
young adulthood provides the backstory for his abortion advocacy,
which will become a matter of contention between the doctor and the
orphan, who grows up to work in Wilbur's infirmary. Still, as
imagined by Parnell, Ms. Jones and Hulce, Homer and Wilbur never
translate into complex or vibrant beings.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is a sweetly boyish Homer, but there is an essential
blankness in the rendering of him _ he absorbs rather than acts _
that hardly makes him compelling over the long haul. Meaney's
reserved Wilbur is more troublesome. His is a performance of such
extreme Yankee stoicism _ remember this actor's bemused Irish
father in ``The Commitments''? _ that it comes across as diffident.
The flavors of a relationship allowed to marinate over so many
stage hours must appeal to the entire palate; this one doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Around this central pair orbit a multitude of secondary
characters, some of whom spring agreeably to life, like the St.
Cloud's nurses (Marceline Hugot and Peggy Roeder) and a whore from
Wilbur's past (Leslie Hendrix). The orphans of St. Cloud's, like
the outcasts of Dotheboys Hall in ``Nickleby,'' are played by
grown-ups, and few are permitted to develop any real personality.
The exception is Jillian Armenante, who contributes a showy
physical performance as Melony, the toughest, orneriest and
man-hungriest orphan in the institution.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her zesty, mountain-woman arrival hits you like a snowball in
the kisser; suddenly, there is a larger-than-life figure in your
midst, a character recognizable from the pen of the whimsical
Irving. Ms. Armenante, with the gait and set jaw of a tailback,
tumbles and climbs and claps Homer on the back so hard that he
coughs. Her admirable energy aside, though, the performance is in
another production from everyone else's, and it comes across as a
little desperate. This may be the result of some encouragement by
directors eager to get the evening's juices flowing, but while Ms.
Armenante is wacky, she is also out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   The play's narrative style, chosen, in Ms. Jones' words, so that
the author's work can be presented ``exactly as he wrote it,''
points up some other questionable choices by the directors. While
the sharing of narration is a tried and true device, having the
actors comment omnisciently on their  &UR; own &LR;  thoughts and behavior
often seems redundant. And there are weird and glaring
inconsistencies in the physical staging. The miming of a knock on a
door, for instance, is accompanied by the sound of knocking, but
the opening and closing of the invisible door remains silent. A
doctor dons surgical dress and has an assortment of obstetrical
instruments in front of him, but mimes the removal of surgical
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of theatrical incongruities that get tallied
in the mind as credulity begins to flag. An audience comes to an
enterprise of the scope and vigor of ``The Cider House Rules'' with
all the puppy-dog optimism of those outdoorsy, adventurous Winkles.
It's a real letdown, though, when the expedition proves less
enthralling than what was described in the brochures.

`JACQUELINE DU PRE': A MEASURED LIFE STUDY OF A MERCURIAL GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardly had the need arisen when Elizabeth Wilson's ``Jacqueline
du Pre: Her Life, Her Music, Her Legend'' arrived to supply a
corrective. The world does not always appear so well regulated.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem so when du Pre, after a woefully brief,
brilliant career as a cellist, was forced to stop performing in
1973, at 28, by multiple sclerosis. Nor did it seem so when, a
decade after her death, her sister, Hilary, and her brother, Piers,
published ``A Genius in the Family: An Intimate Memoir of
Jacqueline du Pre'' in England, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That book, since issued in the United States and turned into the
film ``Hilary and Jackie,'' seemed bent on reducing the superstar
cellist to the all too human size of her siblings and left no one
in the family looking good. Now Ms. Wilson, herself a cellist and
the author of the valuable ``Shostakovich: A Life Remembered,''
sets things right with the most thorough and measured treatment of
du Pre's life and artistry to date.
</P>
<P>
   Like the finest earlier du Pre biographer, Carol Easton, Ms.
Wilson knew du Pre personally. Though they were English
contemporaries, they met only in Moscow, where Ms. Wilson was
studying at the conservatory when du Pre went there in 1966 to
study with Mstislav Rostropovich. The author also benefits from the
cooperation of many of du Pre's friends and intimates. Some,
including her husband, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim,
withheld that cooperation to the sister and brother: not
unreasonably, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this book is not a panegyric either to du Pre or to those
around her. Ms. Wilson does not flinch from the awkward facts
revealed in the recent book and film: that du Pre, in the throes of
a physical and psychological breakdown that in retrospect can
hardly be viewed apart from her devastating illness, for a time
became intimate with Hilary's husband, Christopher Finzi; and that
Barenboim, living in Paris while du Pre languished in the later
stages of her disease in London, had taken up with Elena
Bashkirova, whom he has since married.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Ms. Wilson sensationalize, and placed in the
context of so rich a life so bountifully related, those facts
recede to manageable perspective. Clearly, the main characters are
to be pitied rather than judged.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre's mother, too, receives a more sympathetic portrayal here
than she did from the children who survived her. Iris Greep, an
accomplished pianist, ``had the sensitivity to recognize the unique
nature of Jackie's talent _ namely the deeply felt inner passion
which illuminated her attitude to music from the earliest age,''
Ms. Wilson writes. Evidently, neither that unique talent nor the
mother's attentions to it afforded much pleasure to du Pre's
siblings, especially to Hilary, a flutist of some talent who seems
to imagine that if choices and breaks had fallen differently, she
might also have had a major career.
</P>
<P>
   As a musician herself, Ms. Wilson is well equipped to seek out
the source of du Pre's genius. Technique was never a prime concern,
and in fact du Pre's methods were often unconventional, mercurial
and inimitable. She seemed to grasp music whole and emit it intact,
without a thought to individual notes, finger shifts or bowings.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too facile to think of such an intuitive artist as
some sort of idiot savant. Du Pre made an early escape from the
English school system and was not well educated outside music, a
failing she profoundly regretted and partially remedied during her
years of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Even in music, her horizons were limited; as Ms. Wilson takes
pains to establish, du Pre ran deep and impetuous rather than broad
and meandering. There was never an indication that she would not
have understood thoroughly what she was doing if she had cared to
try. Just such an understanding emerged in some of her teaching in
later years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression, from hearing and seeing her play, was that the
music just poured out of her, as a natural and unthought process,''
Robert Cohen, a cellist who studied with du Pre, tells Ms. Wilson.
``Soon I realized that she had always known precisely what she was
doing _ you understand this when you listen to the records.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is not without flaws. Annoying Britishisms survive from
the original publication last year. Ms. Wilson drops homey
abbreviations liberally (CBSO, for example, for the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra). She is also quaintly cavalier about
American institutions and individuals, misidentifying orchestras
and misspelling names with some regularity. (She probably fails to
realize how rudely she has deflated the grandly named Daniel
Webster, a critic of The Philadelphia Inquirer, in calling him
David.)
</P>
<P>
   More damaging is a prose style that tends to plod. Nonspecialist
readers may tire of some painstakingly detailed musical discussion,
returning as it so often does to the same few works that anchored
Ms. du Pre's repertory, which was limited not only by her short
career but also by a basic lack of interest in music of any great
modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the very depth and detail of that discussion that
makes Ms. Wilson's work so valuable, pinning down the elusive
qualities that made for du Pre's genius and, in the end, separated
her by a wide margin from most of her professional peers as well as
her siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre also comes in for brief treatment in another new book,
``Musical Prodigies: Perilous Journeys, Remarkable Lives,'' by
Claude Kenneson, another cellist and a professor emeritus at the
University of Alberta. Kenneson discusses 44 musical prodigies,
ranging from Mozart to the Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie,
in greater or lesser detail.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneson provides fine insights, particularly in the cases of
cello prodigies he has taught: Eric Wilson and Shauna Rolston.
Bejun Mehta offers as epilogue his own fascinating account of his
journey from broken-down boy soprano to worldbeating countertenor.
</P>
<P>
   But the du Pre account, one of the weaker sections, consists
largely of her mother's tribute ``Born for the Cello'' and is not
particularly enlightening. Kenneson makes no reference to ``A
Genius in the Family'' (or even to sibling rivalry), drawing
instead on Ms. Easton's biography and William Wordsworth's
``Jacqueline du Pre: Impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the source of a telling comment of du Pre's with
regard to Elgar, which her own life seems to have borne out in
abundance: ``A genius is one who, with an innate capacity, affects
for good or evil the life of others.'' From both sides, the
testimony is ample.

`TWAIN' IS BACK, PEPPERY AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old man in the white suit puffs on a cigar and considers
Satan, a figure blamed by everybody for the sins of everybody else.
``Let's hear his side,'' Mark Twain says. ``Anybody who's charged
with being spiritual head of four-fifths of the human race, and
political head of all of it, must have executive ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1905, and Twain, as depicted by Hal Holbrook in
``Mark Twain Tonight!,'' is 70 and on a bristling good tear about
politics, racism, lying, the tendency of the righteous to make a
graveyard of the globe in their quest for admission to the kingdom
of heaven, and humans' exalted notion of themselves in the ranking
of God's creatures. ``Man's idea is that the deity sits up nights
admiring him,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When it was broadcast by CBS on March 6, 1967, the 90-minute
show attracted 30 million viewers. Last week it was released for
the first time on video by Kultur
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook, now 74, began what has become 45 years of Twain
performances with a monologue at Lock Haven State Teachers College
in Pennsylvania in 1954. He currently performs the show 20 to 25
times a year and the idea remains the same: an evolving
accumulation of observations drawn from Twain's writings and put
together with considerable dramatic license by Holbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twain never wrote the show, but everything in it he wrote,''
he said last week. With someone as prolific as Twain, material is
still plentiful. ``Any one selection of 5 or 10 minutes could come
from 15 different sources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lock Haven State, the audience began to laugh. ``I realized
you could go out on stage and get away with this,'' Holbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier he and his first wife, Ruby Holbrook, both freshly
graduated from Denison University, toured rural Texas performing
excerpts from Shakespeare and, ``if you can believe this,''
Holbrook said, ``Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences, he added, were accustomed to Roy Rogers. ``Our
get-away-with-your-life number was Mark Twain,'' he said. In New
York, he expanded the Twain part of the routine and performed it at
the Purple Onion Club and later off Broadway at the 41st Street
Theater. Ed Sullivan came with some fight-crowd friends, liked what
he saw and bought six minutes for his own show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 ``Mark Twain Tonight!'' played on Broadway and won a
Tony. In the first section of the CBS production, Twain salutes the
first pioneer to arrive on any scene (whisky), chides the National
Asylum for the Helpless (Congress) and male 20-somethings (``young
men studying for the gallows''), and suggests that the cow-catcher
on a slow-moving, much-delayed train he'd been riding be moved from
the front to the back to prevent the cows from getting on board.
</P>
<P>
   The second section includes a passage from ``Huckleberry Finn.''
Jim, the runaway slave, is determined to find freedom and work hard
so he can buy his wife. Then they'll both work hard so they can buy
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Later Twain positions most of mankind somewhere between the
angels and the French. ``It's a shame the Noah party didn't miss
the boat,'' he says. &QL;

<P>
   Always colorful and sometimes exuberant, Larry Clark's film
about four druggy losers has none of the cautionary power of his
bruising first film, ``Kids.'' Mel (James Woods, with Vincent
Kartheiser) and Sidney (Melanie Griffith) and Bobbie (Kartheiser)
and Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner) are sort of elder and younger
Bonnie and Clydes on a slide to nowhere. Whether any of them last
to achieve full adulthood is questionable, but Clark is more
interested in day-by-day details in his second, more benign film,
which, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``delivers what
his first promised: bad times with a wicked way of looking good.'' &QL;

<P>
   In the series' latest installment, the starship Enterprise sets
down on a bucolic planet where a tribe of 600 called the Baku lives
in utopian harmony and never gets older. That interests the Sona,
an ancient and leathery breed who definitely need a change of scene
before they fall apart completely.
</P>
<P>
   A plot is hatched to remove the Baku, which calls for the
strong, wise intercession of Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), the
Enterprise captain, who then finds himself charged with treason by
corrupt superiors. ``What makes this hokum work as entertainment is
the series' unquestioned belief in basic human benignity'' (Stephen
Holden). &QL;

   In the most recent and weakest addition to the ``irresistible
governess'' genre, the beautiful, clever Mary Lavelle (Polly
Walker) becomes romantically entangled with a member of her
employer's family. In this case Nick Hamm's film goes whole hog,
imagining itself as the Spanish Civil War equivalent of ``Dr.
Zhivago.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mary's lover there is the handsome, married Francisco
(Vincent Perez), but like Ms. Walker he isn't much of an actor.
Sets are lavish, scenery and costumes are sumptuous. Now if
anything else worked, the movie ``might at least have worked as a

   Todd Haynes' film brilliantly reimagines the heyday of British
glam-rock and the David Bowie of the early 1970s as a brave new
world of electrifying theatricality and sexual possibility. Tracing
its tendrils back to Oscar Wilde, the story carries the Wildean
flamboyance forward to the pansexual pop utopia over which Bowie
presided.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the Bowie-esque Brian Slade, Jonathan Rhys Meyers
stands out in a film that doesn't address Bowie directly but
``appropriates his shimmering, protean aura in virtuoso ways''
(Maslin). &QL;

   CHARLES: DEAD OR ALIVE. He claims to be a watchmaker and
businessman, the third generation to head a prosperous family
business, but Charles is really a fugitive of sorts: a 50-year-old
who has left his family and struck out to discover new truths for
himself. That leads to a world of thought and reverie in Alain
Tanner's first film, which in its best moments, Roger Greenspun
wrote in The New York Times, reflects ``a sense of intelligent,
poised relaxation.'' 1969. New Yorker. $89.95. 93 minutes. French

   LIFE OF JESUS. Working with grim exactitude to convey the
unhappiness of a becalmed village in northern France, Bruno
Dumont's first feature film tells the story of Freddy, a sad lad
with an inexpressive face and a brutish skinhead look. When one of
their number lies dying of AIDS, Freddy (David Douche) and his
friends set up a vigil, experiencing a brush with death that leads
to desperate behavior later. Flat and unswerving, the film, Janet
Maslin wrote in The Times, nevertheless ``does bring haunting power
to the bitter, tongue-tied helplessness that sets its tragedy in
motion.'' 1998. Fox Lorber. $89.98. 96 minutes. French with English
subtitles. No rating.

 &HT;    WEST, RUSSIA AGREE ON PLAN FOR SECURITY FORCE IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trims.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT_ In a potential breakthrough in the search for peace
in Kosovo, Russia formally agreed Thursday to support a plan for
placing the embattled Yugoslav province under the protection of an
international security force that would guarantee broad autonomy
for ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed the agreement as ``a move forward,''
but vowed that NATO warplanes would continue pounding Yugoslavia
from the air in the hope of speeding the advance of diplomacy on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real peace process underway, but it has no chance
of reaching a satisfactory conclusion unless we maintain allied
unity and firmness,'' Clinton told a group of European
correspondents here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of changing policies until the basic
conditions are met,'' he added. ``I will stay for as long as it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's agreement was reached during a meeting in nearby Bonn
among top diplomats from the United States, Russia and six other
democratic powers, the so-called Group of Eight, or G-8. Their
agreement to a set of principles appeared to put new pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept foreign troops on
Serbian soil in exchange for an end to the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has not accepted the terms, and Clinton made clear
that tough diplomacy lies ahead on what could still be a long road
toward peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the process is long, but I don't think we can
afford to be discouraged or be impatient,'' Clinton said, following
a meeting focused on Kosovo with German Chancellor Gerhardt
Schroeder(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that there is no reason whatsoever to now think about
a change in the NATO strategy, now that the strategy does seem to
work,'' Schroeder added. ``And I'm talking about the military as
well as political initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   After six inconclusive weeks of bombing, though, Clinton just as
clearly welcomed the possibilities presented by Russia's acceptance
of the need for some sort of armed security force to oversee the
return of refugees and the establishment of broad self government
for Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to read this as a move forward in increasing the
likelihood that there will ultimately be a resolution of this that
will actually work,'' Clinton said. ``I was personally very pleased
by it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia on board -- in principle at least -- with most of
NATO's terms, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution ``as
quickly as we can,'' authorizing peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the
agreement as an ``important step,'' and welcomed the decision to
seek a U.N. Security Council resolution for any international force
needed in Kosovo to protect the return of hundreds of thousands of
refugees Yugoslavia has expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has so far rejected such a force, on the grounds that
it would violate Yugoslav sovereignty. Instead he has said he would
accept lightly-armed civilian monitors operating under U.N.
auspices.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russia's participation in drafting Thursday's accord is
the latest indication that Milosevic was prepared to settle, even
as allied warplanes continued pounding the country Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His decision last week to release three captured U.S. soldiers
seems to have been a signal that he was ready to compromise. And a
trip to Rome on Wednesday by moderate Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova took many by surprise _ Western leaders considered
Rugova a prisoner of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serb permission for Rugova to go to Rome indicated that he was
likely carrying a message from Milosevic outlining his desire to
compromise on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's accord appeared to present Milosevic with a
stark choice: accept a NATO-led security force or part ways with
Moscow, his closest and most influential partner and the only
reliable friend of Yugoslavia's able to block a Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to a wider agreement with the Russians,''
Albright told reporters following the G-8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The group was not able to agree on a critical feature of any
peacekeeping operation: the composition of the force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO partners are demanding that the
contingent be a fully combat-ready ground force, with tens of
thousands of infantry troops, backed with tanks and air power,
commanded and controlled by NATO. Otherwise, Clinton maintains,
ethnic Albanian refugees won't feel safe to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has rejected such a formulation, saying the peacekeepers
should operate under U.N. auspices, an idea the United States
regards as a dead letter.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Thursday's G-8 agreement marks an advance because,
for the first time, Russia has bought into the idea that the force
must be a military operation, not simply civilian monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The document doesn't specify a military force, only a
``security'' presence the agreement describes as ``effective,'' and
``capable.''
</P>
<P>
   That, said Albright, means NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree it has to be a military force,'' Albright said.
``It has to be robust and be able to play its role,'' of providing
the protection needed to insure ethnic Albanian refugees that it
would be safe to return to their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have NATO at its core and it will have other countries
associated with it,'' she said, referring to the long-standing U.S.
position that Russian troops should be part of any peacekeeping
force in Kosovo, as they are in the NATO operation policing the
fragile peace in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement signed by Albright, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and their counterparts from Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan, the countries endorsed several
``general principles,'' that should guide a resolution of the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The principles included an end to the fighting in Kosovo and the
safe return of the estimated 1.5 million ethnic Albanians who have
fled their homes in the ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   In the key areas of the formulation of the peacekeeping force
and the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops and police from Kosovo,
however, the G-8 document was sufficiently vague to allow each
nation to give its own public interpretation of the agreement's
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   That tact is meant to allow Russia to finesse the tricky
domestic politics of sidling up with NATO, which most Russians
regard as a needless and threatening post-Cold War anachronism. The
ambiguity, however, also carries the risk that not all parties
believe they have agreed to the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for ``effective international civil and
security presences,'' for example, without specifying the make-up
of either.
</P>
<P>
   The civil presence, which would help to set up democratic
institutions and the roots of self-government for Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority, is less of an issue than the security force.
Clinton and his NATO counterparts have long spoken of the need for
a civil operation, and have often suggested the use of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for such
a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's G-8 statement also calls for the ``withdrawal from
Kosovo of military, police and paramilitary forces.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't specify, however, how many must be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates there are some 40,000 such forces inside
Kosovo. Milosevic has insisted on keeping about 11,000 inside
Kosovo after any peace accord is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the U.S. view that all forces need to be withdrawn,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies hold Yugoslav military and
police responsible for widespread atrocities that allegedly have
left more than 4,000 ethnic Albanians dead since March 24, when
NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia after a year of
mounting tension between the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government and
Kosovar Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has challenged the scale of alleged atrocities against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but admits that a crackdown he ordered
on the armed Albanian separatists has raged far beyond acceptable
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also endorses NATO's earlier call to place Kosovo
under international administration over some unspecified period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 document calls for the United Nations to oversee the
interim administration of Kosovo. It also calls for ``substantial
self-government,'' for the province's majority ethnic Albanians,
but rules out independence, citing the need to retain Kosovo as
part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Germany Thursday and was scheduled to spend the
night in Washington before leaving town again Friday for a two-day
trip to Houston, Austin and finally, Oklahoma City to visit the
areas ravaged by killer tornadoes earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a two-day swing through Belgium and Germany, Clinton
visited earlier Thursday with Albanian refugees at the Rhein Main
Air Base here, home to a fleet of giant U.S. cargo planes and
refueling tankers supporting NATO's ongoing humanitarian efforts
and air strikes in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that every freedom-loving person in the
entire world know the story of Kosovo,'' Clinton told the refugees.

 &HT;    WEST, RUSSIA AGREE ON PLAN FOR SECURITY FORCE IN KOSOVO

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT_ In a potential breakthrough in the search for peace
in Kosovo, Russia formally agreed Thursday to support a plan for
placing the embattled Yugoslav province under the protection of an
international security force that would guarantee broad autonomy
for ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed the agreement as ``a move forward,''
but vowed that NATO warplanes would continue pounding Yugoslavia
from the air in the hope of speeding the advance of diplomacy on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real peace process underway, but it has no chance
of reaching a satisfactory conclusion unless we maintain allied
unity and firmness,'' Clinton told a group of European
correspondents here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of changing policies until the basic
conditions are met,'' he added. ``I will stay for as long as it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's agreement was reached during a meeting in nearby Bonn
among top diplomats from the United States, Russia and six other
democratic powers, the so-called Group of Eight, or G-8. Their
agreement to a set of principles appeared to put new pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept foreign troops on
Serbian soil in exchange for an end to the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has not accepted the terms, and Clinton made clear
that tough diplomacy lies ahead on what could still be a long road
toward peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the process is long, but I don't think we can
afford to be discouraged or be impatient,'' Clinton said, following
a meeting focused on Kosovo with German Chancellor Gerhardt
Schroeder(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that there is no reason whatsoever to now think about
a change in the NATO strategy, now that the strategy does seem to
work,'' Schroeder added. ``And I'm talking about the military as
well as political initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   After six inconclusive weeks of bombing, though, Clinton just as
clearly welcomed the possibilities presented by Russia's acceptance
of the need for some sort of armed security force to oversee the
return of refugees and the establishment of broad self government
for Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to read this as a move forward in increasing the
likelihood that there will ultimately be a resolution of this that
will actually work,'' Clinton said. ``I was personally very pleased
by it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia on board -- in principle at least -- with most of
NATO's terms, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution ``as
quickly as we can,'' authorizing peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the
agreement as an ``important step,'' and welcomed the decision to
seek a U.N. Security Council resolution for any international force
needed in Kosovo to protect the return of hundreds of thousands of
refugees Yugoslavia has expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has so far rejected such a force, on the grounds that
it would violate Yugoslav sovereignty. Instead he has said he would
accept lightly-armed civilian monitors operating under U.N.
auspices.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russia's participation in drafting Thursday's accord is
the latest indication that Milosevic was prepared to settle, even
as allied warplanes continued pounding the country Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His decision last week to release three captured U.S. soldiers
seems to have been a signal that he was ready to compromise. And a
trip to Rome on Wednesday by moderate Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova took many by surprise _ Western leaders considered
Rugova a prisoner of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serb permission for Rugova to go to Rome indicated that he was
likely carrying a message from Milosevic outlining his desire to
compromise on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's accord appeared to present Milosevic with a
stark choice: accept a NATO-led security force or part ways with
Moscow, his closest and most influential partner and the only
reliable friend of Yugoslavia's able to block a Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to a wider agreement with the Russians,''
Albright told reporters following the G-8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The group was not able to agree on a critical feature of any
peacekeeping operation: the composition of the force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO partners are demanding that the
contingent be a fully combat-ready ground force, with tens of
thousands of infantry troops, backed with tanks and air power,
commanded and controlled by NATO. Otherwise, Clinton maintains,
ethnic Albanian refugees won't feel safe to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has rejected such a formulation, saying the peacekeepers
should operate under U.N. auspices, an idea the United States
regards as a dead letter.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Thursday's G-8 agreement marks an advance because,
for the first time, Russia has bought into the idea that the force
must be a military operation, not simply civilian monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The document doesn't specify a military force, only a
``security'' presence the agreement describes as ``effective,'' and
``capable.''
</P>
<P>
   That, said Albright, means NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree it has to be a military force,'' Albright said.
``It has to be robust and be able to play its role,'' of providing
the protection needed to insure ethnic Albanian refugees that it
would be safe to return to their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have NATO at its core and it will have other countries
associated with it,'' she said, referring to the long-standing U.S.
position that Russian troops should be part of any peacekeeping
force in Kosovo, as they are in the NATO operation policing the
fragile peace in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement signed by Albright, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and their counterparts from Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan, the countries endorsed several
``general principles,'' that should guide a resolution of the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The principles included an end to the fighting in Kosovo and the
safe return of the estimated 1.5 million ethnic Albanians who have
fled their homes in the ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   In the key areas of the formulation of the peacekeeping force
and the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops and police from Kosovo,
however, the G-8 document was sufficiently vague to allow each
nation to give its own public interpretation of the agreement's
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   That tact is meant to allow Russia to finesse the tricky
domestic politics of sidling up with NATO, which most Russians
regard as a needless and threatening post-Cold War anachronism. The
ambiguity, however, also carries the risk that not all parties
believe they have agreed to the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for ``effective international civil and
security presences,'' for example, without specifying the make-up
of either.
</P>
<P>
   The civil presence, which would help to set up democratic
institutions and the roots of self-government for Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority, is less of an issue than the security force.
Clinton and his NATO counterparts have long spoken of the need for
a civil operation, and have often suggested the use of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for such
a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's G-8 statement also calls for the ``withdrawal from
Kosovo of military, police and paramilitary forces.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't specify, however, how many must be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates there are some 40,000 such forces inside
Kosovo. Milosevic has insisted on keeping about 11,000 inside
Kosovo after any peace accord is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the U.S. view that all forces need to be withdrawn,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies hold Yugoslav military and
police responsible for widespread atrocities that allegedly have
left more than 4,000 ethnic Albanians dead since March 24, when
NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia after a year of
mounting tension between the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government and
Kosovar Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has challenged the scale of alleged atrocities against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but admits that a crackdown he ordered
on the armed Albanian separatists has raged far beyond acceptable
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also endorses NATO's earlier call to place Kosovo
under international administration over some unspecified period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 document calls for the United Nations to oversee the
interim administration of Kosovo. It also calls for ``substantial
self-government,'' for the province's majority ethnic Albanians,
but rules out independence, citing the need to retain Kosovo as
part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Germany Thursday and was scheduled to spend the
night in Washington before leaving town again Friday for a two-day
trip to Houston, Austin and finally, Oklahoma City to visit the
areas ravaged by killer tornadoes earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a two-day swing through Belgium and Germany, Clinton
visited earlier Thursday with Albanian refugees at the Rhein Main
Air Base here, home to a fleet of giant U.S. cargo planes and
refueling tankers supporting NATO's ongoing humanitarian efforts
and air strikes in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that every freedom-loving person in the
entire world know the story of Kosovo,'' Clinton told the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been done to you and your children and your homeland
cannot be undone. But you must know that you have not been
forgotten or abandoned,'' Clinton said, vowing, ``You will go home
again -- in safety and in freedom.''

ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF SPY INVESTIGATION TO BE PROBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department officials and FBI agents will
serve on a special task force to probe the administration's
handling of allegations that a Los Alamos computer scientist passed
nuclear weapons secrets to China, Attorney General Janet Reno said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to review everything we've done to see if there is
anything that could have been done differently,'' Reno said at her
weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will include assistant U.S. attorneys and FBI
agents not connected with the government's past investigation of
scientist Wen Ho Lee and will examine how the Clinton
administration and previous Republican administrations handled
suspicions that Lee was a spy, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not comment on the size of the task force, what
specific areas or which personnel it would cover or when its
findings would be released.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after Senate Republicans accused the
administration of bungling its investigation into the spying
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think heads should roll,'' Don Nickles, R-Okla., the Senate
majority whip, said Wednesday at a hearing held by the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles criticized the Justice Department for failing in 1997 to
get a warrant to search an unclassified computer belonging to Lee
at his lab work space. That computer became the focus of
investigation after it was learned that Lee had downloaded highly
secret information into it from a classified computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``An individual is suspected of being a spy with access to all
of our warhead information ... and we did not get into his
computer,'' Nickles said. ``This is total incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, the director of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, John Browne, said that although Lee was
suspected for nearly three years of having given secrets to China,
lab officials kept him at his job because FBI agents said removing
him could jeopardize their investigation of the physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, a 20-year employee at Los Alamos who became the research
lab's director 18 months ago, said Lee, an American citizen born in
Taiwan, would have been transferred out of the secure areas if the
FBI had approved such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This points out the dilemma of balancing the requirements of
national security against the constraints guiding law enforcement
efforts,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Browne also revealed that FBI agents dissuaded lab officials
from checking the scientist's office computer by telling them that
a search might taint evidence and ruin a potential criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Lee, like all other employees at the lab, had
signed a waiver permitting his e-mail and personal computer to be
reviewed without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the waiver, Browne said, the FBI and Justice Department
decided a court warrant would be needed before that step could be
taken. Without a warrant, Justice and FBI officials told him,
information taken from Lee's computer under the waiver could not be
used in any criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired on March 8 from his job as a computer scientist
with access to secrets about the W-88 warhead, the most advanced in
the U.S. arsenal. Lee remains under investigation for possible
espionage, dating back to the 1980s, but has not been charged with
any crime.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces possible charges of transferring more than 1,000
classified nuclear computer files to his unclassified computer
between 1983 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FBI is investigating whether some other party
gained access to the material with or without Lee's six-digit
password.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has repeatedly denied that he committed any crime. China
also has denied that it stole U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   According to government officials, after two years of
investigation gave no indication that Lee had any relationship with
Chinese intelligence, the FBI tried last summer to entice him into
spying using two Chinese-American agents. The agents told Lee they
were looking for information to help their country, but he turned
them down.
</P>
<P>
   The main indication so far that Beijing gained U.S. nuclear
secrets is the discovery of a 1988 Chinese military document that
contains data on the exact dimensions and shape of the W-88
miniature warhead and the weight and explosive yields of a six
other U.S. systems, according to administration sources.

DECREASED EXPECTATIONS WHILE GETTING THE DICKENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If competing with Charles Dickens were not daunting enough,
moviemakers who take on his work also find themselves up against
the memories of adaptations past, and none more memorably than
``Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans may argue over whether the book is among Dickens' best, but
the 1947 British adaptation, directed by David Lean and brought
back with welcome frequency on television, is by any measure a fine
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry if comparisons prove invidious, but the respectable BBC
version that begins on Sunday on ``Masterpiece Theater'' provides
scant competition for John Mills, Alec Guinness, Finlay Currie,
Francis L. Sullivan, Valerie Hobson and others who carried the tale
of Pip's enlightenment about life, love and loyalty so vibrantly
onto the larger screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the new version, Ioan Gruffudd makes an earnest and generally
engaging Pip, ``a young fellow of great expectations'' who depends
on the kindness of a stranger. It gives away no secrets to reveal
that Pip endures some hard knocks from assorted odd teachers in the
course of his moral education.
</P>
<P>
   There is Magwitch (Bernard Hill), the escaped convict who starts
out as a boy's nightmare and ends up a pussycat; Estella (Justine
Waddell), who starts out as a haughty beauty trained to wreak
vengeance on all mankind and ends up a victim of her own misshapen
character, and of course Miss Havisham, whom Charlotte Rampling
plays not as a batty old lady but as a vulnerable middle-aged one.
</P>
<P>
   Hill brings spirit to the proceedings at every appearance, but
Ms. Waddell could do with more variety in her interpretation, and
it does not take long for Ms. Rampling's persistently enigmatic
expression to lose force.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters, the calculating and sardonic Jaggers, his
clerk, Wemmick, of the businesslike exterior and warm interior, and
the amiable Herbert Pocket add flavor. But the only full-bodied
figure is Joe Gargery (Clive Russell), Pip's brother-in-law and, as
the feckless young man belatedly learns, the sturdy moral center of
this complicated parable. Pip himself comes across as less fun and
more of a whiner than I remembered.
</P>
<P>
   The work's abounding coincidences and mild mysteries are
efficiently if somewhat somberly treated in Tony Marchant's
three-hour adaptation. The director, Julian Jarrold, resorts too
often to an overactive camera and scenic embellishments (all those
candles!) as though he didn't trust Dickens to provide sufficient
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As always, true Dickensians will lament the absence of some
characters and the diminishment of others, but the producers did
well to shun the happy ending that Dickens tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   So don't let your expectations get too great. This production,
though always intelligent, is smaller than life and much smaller
than Dickens.

   WHERE THE WATER FALLS: Brevard, N.C., is famous for at least two
things: white squirrels and waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   In my years of travel to this picturesque western North Carolina
town, I never spotted any of the ghostlike nut-gatherers, but I did
take in scores of the 150 or so assorted waterfalls that bathe the
lush forests.
</P>
<P>
   Why are there so many falls in one spot? The best hypothesis I
heard was that the area was perfectly situated near the base of the
Blue Ridge Mountains, which happen to be the first barrier the
clouds hit as they move up from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As the clouds rise up the mountains, they dump rain _ about 100
inches a year _ which cascades down the rocky hillsides, forming
such wonders as Whitewater Falls, Looking Glass Falls and Bridal
Veil Falls.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite by far is Sliding Rock. For the modest fee of $3 a
carload, you can slide down a 60-foot-long natural rock chute that
dumps you into a 6- to 7-foot-deep pool where the water temperature
is 55 degrees _ in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that even Lassie took the plunge while filming the

</P>
<P>
   Bathhouses are available, and lifeguards are on duty from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. in the summer. Wear your cutoffs _ the rock can take
its toll on thong bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   Brevard is next to the Pisgah National Forest, which lays claim
to being the birthplace of modern forestry methods, thanks to the
largess of George Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   When he built nearby Biltmore House, he also acquired 125,000
acres and hired forestry experts to manage it. You can live the
life of those early forestry students at the Cradle of Forestry and
their methods with a sawmill and locomotive circa 1914. Entry fees
are $4 for adults and $2 for kids 6-17.
</P>
<P>
   The city also appeals to music lovers, who flock to Brevard
College each summer for its annual music festival, which will run
June 23-Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Brevard remains quieter and quainter than much of the mountains.
The casino crowd is in nearby Cherokee, and the masses thronging
the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are hours away in line at
some overpriced restaurant in Gatlinburg, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The town offers traditional bed-and-breakfast inns, including
the Inn at Brevard.

<P>
   Summer days can get warm here, typically into the low 80s, but

   VIRTUOUS VICTORIA: Imagine Britain if it were just a bit more
British and you'll get a feel for Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   There's high tea, kilt shops, fine china and plenty of pubs with
amusing names. There are also manners _ lots of them _ everywhere.
One sign in front of a manicured home read: ``We request that no
rubbish be placed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a culture shock for many Americans who try to
get in for high tea at The Empress Hotel wearing shorts and
sneakers. But such niceties make a trip to this Anglophile heaven
the perfect antidote to hot tempers as well as hot temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's harbor skyline is dominated by British Columbia's
Capitol building and The Empress Hotel. Tourists of both sexes
diligently ante up the $25 Canadian for high tea in the hotel
lobby, but it's really a female thing. My husband uncomfortably
nibbled finger sandwiches as the women at a neighboring table
talked hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Many traditionalists insist on staying at The Empress, but the
city has quaint bed-and-breakfast inns on almost every corner.
</P>
<P>
   Budget-minded travelers can check into the University of
Victoria, which opens up its dorm rooms to visitors during the
summer. A four-room suite rents for about $104 in American dollars
and includes a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Butchart Gardens is a must-see. About 13 miles north of the city
in an abandoned quarry, the gardens are an amazing collection of
flora and fountains. Things get jazzed up at night with colored
spotlights shining on the elaborate floral displays. It's
inexplicably appealing.

<P>
   Victoria has almost perfect summers _ rarely cloudy or rainy,
with high temperatures in the '70s. The ocean water looks nice, but
don't try to get in. The only swimmer I saw during my weeklong stay
was a Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   The city can easily be handled on foot, and public buses are
plentiful, but perhaps the best way to experience it is on a motor
scooter. I rented one from a Budget booth on Douglas Street for $26
a day and cruised the island at 15 miles per hour. It was just fast
enough to make a breeze, and slow enough to smell the tall pine
forests along the coast and shrimp on the grill of a million-dollar
home in the Saanich Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I looked back to see a dozen cars dutifully creeping
behind me. The amazing thing was the silence _ no one was honking.
I pulled over to let them all pass and took a moment to soak up the
overwhelming pleasantness of this place. I knew it would be over
all too soon and I'd be back on Airport Freeway with my air
conditioner on the fritz.
</P>
<P>
   At least I'd have my memories to keep me cool.

KEEP YOUR COOL: FOUR FABULOUS PLACES TO BEAT THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHRYN HOPPER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless heat of the Texas summer sun will soon be here,
which means it's time to makes plans to be somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of being near ice, snow, or anywhere evenings get
chilly enough for a long-sleeve cotton sweater sounds good come
July, then consider four vacation spots guaranteed to help you
chill out.
</P>
<P>
   LAND OF ENCHANTMENT: Somewhere between chic Santa Fe and plain
old El Paso is Ruidoso, a city equally removed from the first two
both geographically and spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a French restaurant, but only one. Yes, there are
lots of Southwestern knickknacks, but they're reasonably priced.
Yes, there's a disco, but it's part of the liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   Ruidoso has served as a summer getaway for Texans for years, and
now it's booming right along with the Lone Star State. The main
drag through town, U.S. 70, is being widened to four lanes, and
construction is popping up like yarrow under the pinon trees.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fort Worth, Ruidoso has an odd mixture of cowboys and
culture. Horse lovers have long gathered at Ruidoso Downs, where
races are run every summer weekend. The action culminates on Labor
Day with the running of the $2 million Quarter Horse Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the track is The Museum of the Horse, which offers
a Las Colinaslike bronze sculpture of giddy equines dubbed Free
Spirits at Noisy Water.
</P>
<P>
   The area proudly plays on its ties to outlaw Billy the Kid, who
once eluded capture in a fight on Main Street by hiding in a flour
barrel. On May 28, the Billy the Kid Casino opens at Ruidoso Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The Spencer Theater for the Arts opened two years ago. The
514-seat auditorium is a stark modern building that looks a bit odd
in the rugged mountain landscape but draws a variety of artists,
from the Southern Comfort House of Blues tour to the National
Russian Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road off U.S. 70, the Hurd Ranch Guest House is a
combination upscale inn and art gallery. The inn has three adobe
casitas that boast every extra amenity from satellite dishes to
Saltillo tile floors.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch is also home to an impressive collection of works by
N.C. Wyeth and his son, Andrew Wyeth. Why so many Wyeths? Henrietta
Wyeth, N.C. Wyeth's daughter and Andrew's sister, married Hurd
Ranch founder Peter Hurd.
</P>
<P>
   If you're more into casinos than casitas, head for the Inn of
the Mountain Gods, which is part of the Mescalero Apache Indian
Reservation and, as such, can offer two floors of poker, slots and
keno.
</P>
<P>
   Dining options continue to multiply in Ruidoso. La Lorraine is
an intimate French bistro where lunch can be had for less than $15.
The Lincoln County Grill features sandwiches and burgers, plus such
caloric splurges as The Avalanche, a sundae sculpted to resemble a
mountain catastrophe with spiraling chocolate and swirling nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Alto, hang with the locals at Farley's. The restaurant
offers decent pizza and cold beer, which can be enjoyed over Van
Halen tunes blaring from the jukebox. Billiards and bowling are
part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned that Ruidoso and the surrounding area have endured a
prolonged drought. On a recent visit, high winds kicked up enough
dust to cloud the mountain vistas, and the normally vigorous Rio
Ruidoso was weakening to creek status.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still trickle enough to dip your toe in the river
water and savor what's left of last winter's snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Ruidoso, N.M.: Average July low: 47
</P>
<P>
   Cool information: Ruidoso Chamber of Commerce, (800) 253-2255;
Ruidoso Downs, (505) 378-4142; Spencer Center for the Performing
Arts, (888) 818-7872; Hurd Ranch Guest Homes, (505) 653-4331; Inn
of the Mountain Gods, (800) 545-9011.
</P>
<P>
   Cool Web site: www.ruidoso.net//reservations
</P>
<P>
   Cool thing to do: Order The Avalanche at The Lincoln County
Grill. The only thing it will kill is your appetite _ for the day.
</P>
<P>
   A GLACIER RAN THROUGH IT: Glacier: Even the name is enough to
give you a chill, or at least the hope of one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Glacier National Park in Montana does have glaciers, 38
at last count, they are getting smaller each year because of global
warming. Most park visitors view the glaciers from the famous Going
to the Sun Road, a 52-mile, two-lane blacktop that snakes along the
mountainsides, eventually crossing the Continental Divide at Logan
Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The road is typically open from June to around October, but
summer snows can sometimes block the way at higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to drive it yourself, but that means worrying
about tumbling over the guardrails on the many hairpin curves or
rear-ending the Winnebago in front of you. Instead, ride one of the
park's red buses, known as jammers.
</P>
<P>
   For an up-close glacier experience, brave the four-mile hiking
trail (all uphill) to Grinnell Glacier. It's just one of many
trails that wind around lakes and alpine meadows, all inviting
enough to send you into a Julie Andrews impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget there are bears.
</P>
<P>
   I actually saw one of the estimated 200 grizzlies while
ensconced in my rented Ford Explorer. A young male grizzly
sauntered across Going to the Sun Road in search of huckleberries
or perhaps something even tastier _ Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier devotees typically try to find accommodations inside the
park at one of several lodges operated by the park service. Those
rooms are quick to fill during the high summer season, so be
prepared to check out accommodations in nearby towns including
Whitefish and Kalispell in the Flathead Valley. The Grouse Mountain
Lodge in Whitefish is a pleasant convention-oriented hotel with a
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The valley, named for the Flathead Indians, is in many ways just
as beautiful as Glacier, and certainly provides a softer summer
experience. It's worth making time to sail on Flathead Lake or raft
down the Middle Fork of the Flathead River.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Montana, load up on huckleberries. The wild
berries, a Rocky Mountain cousin to blueberries, are in season in
late summer. The park service offers maps for huckleberry picking.
</P>
<P>
   The Huckleberry Patch in Hungry Horse sells them in everything
from pancakes to milkshakes.

   CALIFORNIA-CAL-GUNS. Two weeks after the massacre at Columbine
High School, California's senators are taking a lead role in trying
to pass anti-gun legislation. While noting that passage remains

   WISCONSIN-KOSOVO-FUNDS. Repeating their vows to save Social
Security, at least three Wisconsin Republicans will vote against
the $12.9 billion funding bill for the military operations in
Kosovo because they say it contains extraneous costs that will
further sap the retirement trust fund. But LaCrosse Democrat Ron
Kind said the death of his constituent, Army Officer Kevin
Reichert, illustrates the need to make sure the military has enough
funds to minimize the risks faced by American troops, although he
disagrees with some of the non-emergency additions to the bill.

CLINTON TO REFUGEES: `YOU WILL GO HOME AGAIN IN SAFETY AND IN
FREEDOM' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGELHEIM, Germany _ President Clinton came face to face
Thursday with the reasons he has risked American soldiers' lives
and expended so much political capital in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time,the president sat down with a group of ethnic
Albanians who had been expelled from their homes in Kosovo by the
Serbs and had ended up at a refugee center in this small town about
an hour's drive southwest of Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised the refugees: ``You will go home again in
safety and in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined by German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder, Clinton listened
as about two dozen men, women and teen-agers related often
emotionally wrenching tales of brutal treatment by the Serb police
and their fears of returning to live side by side with the same
people who threw them out of their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to getting killed and getting murdered,'' one
woman told the leaders. ``But the rape is the most difficult thing
for Albanians. I just cannot describe it. I don't know how to
describe our suffering.``
</P>
<P>
   Others told of years of being harassed by Serbs, of eventually
being forced out of their homes by armed police, of being ordered
to hand over their gold and their cash in exchange for their lives
as they fled for the border.
</P>
<P>
   One man told of how the police demanded more cash than he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said I just have to go and look around to find it. And
then they said, don't come back without 1,000 deutsche marks. And
then I went and borrowed 1,000 marks and returned them to the
police. And they said, `Go and never come back in this land of
Kosovo,''' he told Clinton and Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the president met in a dormitory style room with a
family of seven adults and two children, including a boy who was
born the night the NATO bombings began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Sabit Salihu, 60, related how the family had been
chased from their homes in the village of Dervar on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``My home was burned. We were beaten. Everything was stolen from
us,'' Salihu said as he broke down in tears. ``It is impossible to
describe what they have done to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who Republicans in Congress are criticizing for
involving the United States in NATO's air campaign against Serbia,
urged the refugees to continue telling their tales to help bolster
worldwide support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that people not forget that what is called
ethnic cleansing is not some abstract idea; it is real people with
real families and real dreams being uprooted from their homes,
their schools, their work, their children, their parents, their
husbands and wives,'' the president said as many of the center's
300 refugees listened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to continue the bombing campaign against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to ensure the refugees will eventually
be able to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic has not succeeded in erasing your identity from
the pages of history, and he will not succeed in erasing your
presence from the land of your parents and grandparents,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that computer terminals would be installed in
refugee centers that will provide ethnic Albanians news in their
own language about the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the refugees here the return home may be difficult
even if an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ekrem Lapashtica, a 24-year-old video store owner, said the
police gave his family five minutes to leave their Pristina
neighborhood. Lapashtica told of being forced to wait in long lines
to board trains to the Macedonia border while Serb police harassed
them and demanded money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took some people and I don't know what happened to
them,'' Lapashtica said.
</P>
<P>
   Lapashtica said he rises every day and reads an Albanian
newspaper to find out what is going on in the conflict. With no
employment here, he spends the day playing pingpong at the sports
center in the compound, a group of spare buildings that resembles a
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Germany is better for Lapashtica and others than for
many other refugees who are living in poor conditions in border
camps in Macedonia and Albania. But he said, ``I can hardly wait to
go back to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked if he could live with the Serbs,
Lapashtica responded, ``Never again.``

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Clare Millikan was 8 years old on that June
day in 1924 when word came that her father, British mountain
climber George Mallory, had been ``lost'' on Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Millikan, now 83 and living in Santa Rosa, soon realized she
would never see her beloved father again, a man who taught her to
climb trees and speak French. Mallory, a schoolmaster in Cambridge,
England, was a brilliant scholar and seasoned athlete known for his
adventurous spirit and crazy antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother gathered us on her bed to tell us that my father had
been lost on Mount Everest. I've always thought the word `lost' was
so confusing to a child, because if you're lost you can jolly well
be found again,'' Millikan said Wednesday from her Santa Rosa
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She was the oldest of three children. Her sister, Beridge, was 6
and her brother, John, was 2 when their father vanished on June 8,
1924.
</P>
<P>
   This week, 75 years later, Millikan got word that her father's
body had been found on a windswept ledge on Mount Everest, the
world's tallest mountain. Preserved by the bitter cold temperatures
at that altitude, the body was found at 27,000 feet by five young
climbers retracing the route Mallory and his climbing partner,
Andrew Irvine, had taken in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mallory who quipped that he wanted to climb Everest
``because it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical and spiritual, Millikan said that after nearly eight
decades the news that her father's body had been found didn't cause
too much grief. For years, she said, she has dreamed of her father
and his demise on Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed him terribly,'' she said. She had always hoped his
death was peaceful and painless. She said closure for her had come
years ago _ in her nightly dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't very excited when I heard. My father left his body so
long ago. His body has no use for him now,'' Millikan said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it's the family's desire that Mallory's body be left on
Everest, where it has reposed for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one for bringing bodies back in body bags. I think a
body should stay where the person died,'' Millikan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for something funereal now,'' said Millikan,
who for the past four years has lived at Friends House, a
Quaker-run residential center for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of Mallory's and Irvine's disappearance has
intrigued the world, remaining one of the great unsolved adventure
stories of the century. Since they vanished, the persistent
question has been whether the men died while ascending or
descending Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   If they made it to the top of Everest, they would have been the
first, accomplishing the feat 29 years before Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay stood atop the mountain's 29,028-foot summit in June
1953. The hope is that the Kodak camera Mallory and Irvine carried
and the film inside will be found undamaged to solve the mystery.
If there is photographic proof, they would go into the record books
as the first to conquer Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain they have always been national heroes. They name
Boy Scout troops after them,'' said Millikan, who has lived in the
United States for 60 years. A peace activist and environmentalist,
she lived in Berkeley until moving here.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Simonson, one of the Everest climbers searching for
evidence of Mallory and Irvine, said his group wants to determine
once and for all the fate of the English climbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The achievement of climbers such as George Mallory and Andrew
Irvine is not fully appreciated,'' Simonson said an interview with
Mountain Zone, a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get within a few hundred feet of the summit in 1924,
wearing tweed clothing and using extremely heavy and primitive
oxygen gear, was incredible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine's body has not been found yet.
</P>
<P>
   Millikan said her great love for her father never made her feel
obligated to believe that he had ascended Mount Everest. She said
it really didn't matter to her whether he made it to the top or
not. She is haunted by fears that her father was more concerned
with conquering the mountain than returning to his family in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know that he took every possible precaution _
and didn't do anything harebrained _ so that he could come back to
his family. That would be important for me to know,'' said
Millikan, a rock climber herself when she was younger. Her husband,
Glenn Millikan, a renowned scientist, also died rock climbing. His
death in 1947 in a gorge in Tennessee left her to raise her three
sons, who also do rock climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one ambition was to go up and finish climbing Mount Everest
for my father,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Millikan remembers that when her father left for the expedition
to Mount Everest _ his third trip to the mountain _ he said he
would be careful and vowed to return unharmed. But, she said, it
was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   Millikan said that after her father's death there were dramatic
changes in her life. Her mother was forced to sell the family home
in Cambridge and move her family to her father's country home in
another part of England. Millikan said her grandfather was
financially well fixed, so her family had a comfortable life and
the children went to good schools and eventually universities.
</P>
<P>
   Millikan's sister, Beridge, who became a pediatrician in the
United States, died of breast cancer. Her brother, John Mallory,
lives in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   She said that as a child, she and her siblings would make grave
markers for birds that died after becoming entangled in nets to
protect the fruit on trees. She said they also made little graves
piled with flowers for their father because they had no headstone
in a cemetery to mourn their loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way to heal and pay homage to our lost father,''
Millikan said.

CAMPAIGN-SAVVY CLINTON TO ATTEND TEXAS FUND-RAISERS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton drops by La Colombe d'Or in
Houston &UR;  &LR; on Friday, he won't be just sampling the French cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   As he has so many times in the past, the president will be
prospecting for cash in the Lone Star State, this time on behalf of
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, however, comes at a time of intense competition for
campaign dollars in a state that has increasingly tilted away from
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The state's popular Republican Gov. George W. Bush has been
vacuuming up funds across the state for his expected presidential
bid. Of the $7.6 million that Bush has reported raising for his
exploratory committee this year, $4 million came from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, some Texas Democratic donors would rather give to
congressional campaigns where they can be assured the money will
remain in the state. Money contributed to the national party often
is spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
raised $1 million on a swing through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly competition for campaign money in Texas
these days,'' Houston political consultant Nancy Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sims said corporate executives, lawyers and others in
Texas who want to nourish simultaneous bonds with Republican and
Democratic leaders will continue to find a way to signal their
support for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   And despite their sagging electoral fortunes in the state, Texas
is still viewed as a gold mine by national Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent election cycle, which ended last December,
the national Democratic Party and its candidates scooped up more
than $16 million from Texas, about 40 percent of all money raised
in the state over the two-year period, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics. Only in New York, California and Illinois did
the party do better.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee alone raised $1.4 million in
unrestricted ``soft money'' contributions during the 1997-98
election cycle from Texas, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics analysis. The donor list includes some of the state's top
companies and their executives, many of whom have a stake in
decision-making in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC received $55,000 in corporate and employee giving from
the natural gas giant Enron, which is lobbying for electric utility
deregulation and is headed by prominent Houston Republican Ken Lay.
</P>
<P>
   The party also received about half that much from Maxxam Inc., a
Houston-based timber, aluminum and real estate conglomerate that
recently reached a deal with federal regulators to sell a stand of
centuries-old redwood trees in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, Houston-based Browning Ferris Industries and
EDS, the computer company formerly owned by independent
presidential candidate Ross Perot, also contributed to the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats even received $10,000 from the financier wife of
Richard Rainwater, the Fort Worth billionaire who has been a
business partner of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers, however, stand out as the Democrats' best friends
in Texas when it comes to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of Texas contributors to the DNC was
Houston-based Williams &AMP; Bailey, a high-octane personal injury law
firm. Partner Kenneth Bailey is hosting Friday's fund-raising
luncheon at the posh La Colombe d'Or in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Between 30 to 40 people are expected to shell out $20,000 a
couple to hear the president, with the party officials estimating
the event will bring in $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bailey's partners, John Eddie Williams, will share a $3.3
billion fee for his role with four other lawyers in a recent state
tobacco settlement. The firm gave a total of $250,000 to the
Democratic Party over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The president will end his day in Texas at a fund-raiser in
Austin at the home of an old friend, Roy Spence. The advertising
executive has known Clinton since the two worked on George
McGovern's presidential campaign in 1972. With a minimum
contribution of $1,000 required and a crowd of 125 expected, the
event should generate $250,000, according to DNC officials.
</P>
<P>
   The two events had originally been scheduled for last month but
were canceled because they were scheduled a day after the Colorado
high school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said Clinton was pressured to quickly reschedule
his Texas trip to prevent some of the donors from reneging on their
financial commitments. Much of the money has already been collected
for the two events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid for it. They want the man standing in their living
room.'' said state Democratic Party spokeswoman Liz Chadderdon.
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raiser Clinton headlined for Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro last September netted about $250,000 for
Mauro's campaign, despite a disastrous finish at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   DNC spokesman Peter Kauffmann said the president, despite last
year's scandal, still remains a big draw.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president's approval rating has declined in Texas
since his impeachment ordeal, according to the latest Texas Poll.
The survey of 1,003 Texans found that 48 percent believe he is
doing a good job as president while 49 percent disapprove of his
job performance. In a previous survey, conducted during the Senate
impeachment trial, Clinton's job approval stood at 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And many Democrats are unhappy that DNC fund-raisers tend not
only to siphon money out of the state for projects that do not help
elect local candidates but also end up hampering other fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't do well,'' said one top Democratic House
aide of the national party's fund-raising events in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the congressional Democrats need all the cash they
can raise to help retake the House in 2000. If Democrats hope to
regain the House they cannot afford to lose the 17 seats they now
hold in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also are focusing on keeping control of the Texas
House and retaking the state Senate to ensure the party can play a
role in congressional redistricting after the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   The DCCC hosted a fund-raiser in Houston on April 8 at the home
of lawyer Lee Godfrey, which featured House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Richard Mithoff said he was willing to shell out
money for the DCCC because it helps candidates in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is put the money where I think it will
make the biggest difference,'' Mithoff said. ``And I think that is
the view of a lot of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kauffmann at the DNC said that the party does return a
small portion of the money raised to the state parties. In the last
election cycle it was 7.5 percent.

`MOLLOY': BEFORE THE WAITING STARTED, BECKETT LOVED HIS MOTHER

 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Gogo and Didi began their long wait for Godot,
before Clov and Hamm wound up the alarm clock, before Krapp began
making tapes, Molloy resolved to go and see his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Beckett conceived ``Molloy,'' the first novel in his
caustic trilogy that includes ``Malone Dies'' and ``The
Unnamable,'' after a revelatory visit to his mother in Dublin
during which he realized she had not long to live. It was at that
moment, he said later, that he ``became aware of my stupidity; then
I began to write the things I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Molloy'' was the first inspiration of Beckett's new creative
life, and it previews the compelling and darkly humorous works for
the stage for which he became most famous and is now more widely
remembered. Although written as an interior monologue, the novel is
as gripping as any of the plays and would seem ideal for the
theater. Conor Lovett, an Irish actor, has excerpted passages from
the first part of ``Molloy,'' and is presenting them at the Irish
Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett's program credits list appearances in several Beckett
plays, and he clearly understands the text. He captures all the
rhythms and nuances of Molloy's strange account of his search for
his mother, and he delivers these fragmented snatches of memory in
a deadpan monotone that is effective. But what is oddly missing is
any sense of dramatic continuity to the story. The selection of the
material seems more like an abridged sampler of ``Molloy'' than any
serious attempt to get at the heart of the novel itself.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lovett ignores the famous opening _ ``I am in my
mother's room. It's I who live there now. I don't know how I got
there.'' _ and takes all his material from about one-fourth of the
first section of the novel, and all of it from the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpts chosen by Lovett and also by Judy Hegarty, who
directs the performance, appear aimed at underscoring the comedy in
Beckett's novel, especially the scatological (almost as if Howard
Stern helped in the editing), and Lovett's delivery at times more
resembles a stand-up comic's routine than a one-man dramatization.
There is mystery and suspense as well as humor in the novel, with
Beckett doling out little hints to the plot and character of Molloy
along the way, but Lovett seems to be playing straight for punch
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hegarty's direction does little to enhance the theatricality
of the performance. When Lovett occasionally drops into the voice
of the different characters Molloy meets _ a policeman or Lousse,
the woman whose dog he runs over with his bicycle _ they all tend
to sound alike. The decision not to put Lovett's Molloy on crutches
(or his bike), but to stand in one of three solo spots on a bare
stage, only enhances the impression of this ``Molloy'' being an
audition for an evening of Beckett at Caroline's.
</P>
<P>
   But the words are still those of one of our century's greatest
storytellers, and if Lovett's hour of recitation brings no special
insights to Beckett's extraordinary tale, the humor he conveys may
send his theater audience to the novel itself, and that would be no
small accomplishment.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   High pressure centered over the Grand Banks will circulate
ocean-chilled air into the coastal regions of New England and the
Middle Atlantic region Friday, causing low clouds to linger from
Delaware to southeast Maine. As onshore winds ascend the east
slopes of the Appalachians, fog and drizzle will develop. Just over
the crest of the Appalachians, a warm and humid air mass will be
found from central New York to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry weather will persist in the Southeast, but an approaching
cool front will be the focus of more intense thunderstorms from the
Florida panhandle to the western Carolinas. Most of Florida and the
Southeast Coast will be dry with ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   A jet stream disturbance will move through the Ohio Valley as
the northern section of a cold front pushes slowly eastward. The
air mass over eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and New York will
be ripe for gusty thunderstorms. A couple of storms may become
severe.
</P>
<P>
   The storm center which has brought clouds and showers all week
to the northern Plains and Midwest will make slow progress toward
Lake Superior causing dull, cool and damp conditions to linger over
the Dakotas, Minnesota and parts of Nebraska and Iowa. A corridor
of dry and pleasant weather will stretch from the southern Plains
to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Colder, moist air from the North Pacific will surge into the
Northern Rockies, accompanied by clouds and showers, especially in
the mountains. The Southwest will be quite warm over the interior,
but fog should return to the southwest California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Limited in Scope
</P>
<P>
   Most outbreaks of severe weather are limited in scope. Suppose
the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla., issues a tornado
watch that covers 30,000 square miles of the Deep South. Further
assume that, within the watch area, two massive 60-mile long,
half-mile wide twisters develop. This affected area amounts to 0.2
percent of the watch area. Now suppose that several smaller
tornadoes also occur in addition to narrow streaks of large hail
and damaging straight-line winds. In most cases, the total area
affected by severe weather would still only amount to a fraction of
1 percent.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Perish the thought! Will the new ``Star Wars'' prove
to be a bit of a disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   The new George Lucas extravaganza, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' which opens on May 19, was shown to film industry
exhibitors under tight security on Tuesday night in eight cities,
including Los Angeles and New York. Although some executives who
saw the movie said they thought it would have enormous appeal for
children, some fans and distributors said the 130-minute $115
million epic was not as good as earlier installments of the ``Star
Wars'' series like ``Star Wars'' or ``The Empire Strikes Back.''
Variety reported Thursday that there was a ``less than
enthusiastic'' response to the film at the screenings and that
reactions were decidedly mixed, with only polite applause in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   On the Ain't It Cool News Web site (www.aint-it-cool-news.com)
some fans who apparently slipped into the screenings complained
that the story was weak and the film too ``young-themed'' and
``kid-friendly'' to appeal to adults. They said the film had ``no
chance of overtaking `Titanic's' ticket sales or critical
adulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus on the Web site was that the special effects were
dazzling but that the film, released by 20th Century Fox, would
appeal mostly to children. ``Good, but not great,'' one 16-year-old
fan wrote. ``As a science fiction film it was excellent. But as a
`Star Wars' film? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Another said, ``I was really hoping to like it more.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, studio executives said, expectations for the film
are so extraordinary that it is bound to disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sherak, chairman of 20th Century Fox's Domestic Film Group,
said the film had been shown to recruited audiences in 16 cities
over the last two days. Eight screenings were scheduled Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been fantastic,'' Sherak said. As for the
criticism, Sherak said, ``You can take the Gettysburg Address and
find holes in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sherak added that the two screenings in New York and Los
Angeles ``did not go over the moon'' for two reasons. At the Astor
Plaza Theater in Manhattan, he said, the air-conditioning broke
down and left the audience in a disgruntled mood. ``Rosie O'Donnell
said on television that it was 120 degrees,'' he said. In Los
Angeles, Sherak said, there were not many children in the audience
and the ones who were there were admonished by their parents to be
quiet because it was an important screening. ``Kids were on their
best behavior,'' he said. ``But when we've screened it elsewhere,
the kids applaud. They cheer. It plays through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Two rival studio executives who have every reason to criticize
the movie because they have films opening in June that could be
hurt by the competition said they were dazzled by it. But one said
he doubted that the movie would earn the kind of repeat business
among teen-agers and adults that made James Cameron's ``Titanic''
such a huge hit. That film has grossed about $1.8 billion around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific,'' one executive said of ``Star Wars: Episode I
_ The Phantom Menace.'' ``It absolutely delivers. It's a great show
for the family. But there may be some question of adult
replayability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does go a little younger,'' he said of the film, which is
rated PG. ``Especially in these days of hard-edged PG-13 movies.
This is definitely PG.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top studio executive who saw the film said: ``The
effects are brilliant. It's everything you would expect out of the
film. The story is fun. The characters are not as emotional as the
first installment. There's not that rebelliousness and casualness
that you had in Harrison Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, virtually everyone in Hollywood expects the long-awaited
sequel to emerge as the biggest film of the summer and probably the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the first of three planned ``prequels'' that will
trace young Anakin Skywalker's rise to Jedi knight and his ultimate
surrender to the Dark Side. Its stars include Ewan McGregor as
Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi master;
Natalie Portman as Queen Amidale, and Jake Lloyd as young Anakin.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who is usually reserved and press-shy, has thrown himself
into a publicity blitz for the movie, which many film industry
executives say could take in as much as $100 million in its first
five days.

   For `Parade,' Life After Death
</P>
<P>
   Call it a miracle or a menace, but ``Parade,'' the long-closed
musical produced by a deeply bankrupt company, refuses to fade
away.
</P>
<P>
   The musical's life after death was highlighted on Monday morning
when it landed nine nominations for the Tony Awards, more than any
other show.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday ``Parade'' was voted best musical by the New York
Drama Critics Circle, although after a squabble over whether any
award at all should be given in such an anemic season.
</P>
<P>
   More accolades for the show might come on Sunday, when the Drama
Desk announces its awards: ``Parade'' is nominated for 13 awards,
again more than any other production.
</P>
<P>
   Some producers say the attention paid to ``Parade'' reiterates
the paucity of decent musicals this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another season, they would have been happy not to nominate
it,'' said one producer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``But it's the only real musical there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates for best book for Tony, for example, included
the limited narration of ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' and
Pam Gems' well-worn backstage ancedotes in ``Marlene.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Parade'' nomination was for choreography, another
element in short supply in this season _ and, in fact, in
``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show's producers said the attention was deserved. ``The
operative words are `validation' and `bittersweet,''' said Bernard
Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, a
producer of the show with Livent, which has been in bankruptcy
court since November.
</P>
<P>
   Gersten said that 75 percent of Tony voters had seen the show
before it closed on Feb. 28 and that the cast album, released last
month, was sent to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   The musical is likely to have a production number _ the duet
``All the Wasted Time'' _ at the Tony broadcast on June 6, he
added. But Keith Sherman, a spokesman for the show, would not
confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond CDs and award plaques, the show may have another life.
Officials for the Prince Music Theater in Philadelphia, named for
the ``Parade'' director Hal Prince, said on Wednesday that a new
production of the musical is likely for spring 2000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's Humming &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If this year's crop of musicals wilted on the vine, the harvest
season may bring some hope.
</P>
<P>
   After an ultra-private reading of the score and script last
Friday, confirmation came this week for one highly anticipated
production: ``Wise Guys,'' by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman.
</P>
<P>
   Producers Scott Rudin and Roger Berlind plan to present the
musical, about two rakish brothers, in November at the New York
Theater Workshop in the East Village. In an odd twist, the
production will only be open to workshop members; no public tickets
are available. Victor Garber and Nathan Lane will star.
</P>
<P>
   The creative overhaul of ``Aida'' continues elsewhere. Disney
officials confirmed this week that the playwright David Henry Hwang
is working on the book of the Broadway-bound musical, which stalled
in Atlanta last fall after mediocre reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang, whose official title will be ``creative consultant,''
joins a new team whose aim seems to be to add artistic gravitas to
a show whose earlier incarnation was considered too cartoonlike.
The newcomers include the director Robert Falls (a Tony nominee for
``Death of a Salesman'') and the designer Bob Crowley (a double
Tony nominee for ``Iceman Cometh'' and ``Twelfth Night''). The
first performances of the new ``Aida,'' are planned for November in
Chicago. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Success in `Sideman' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Off Off Broadway actors decided the Tony Awards, Frank Wood
would have been a shoo-in years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his 12-year career, Wood has been a common
sight at such downtown theaters as LaMama, SoHo Rep and the
Workhouse Theater, now called the Flea. ``I was always seeing the
same people in the audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for much of last year Wood has been on Broadway, playing the
emotionally removed father in ``Side Man,'' a performance that was
rewarded on Monday with a Tony nomination for featured actor.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination came as something of a surprise to the
38-year-old actor. ``People had been saying it might be possible,
and I said, `No, it won't,''' he said. `But all of the sudden,
about 48 hours before, I got queasy.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the New York University graduate acting program,
Wood has been with the play since its early readings in 1996.
Between nonpaying acting jobs and low-paying day jobs, Wood said he
had some ``extended fantasies'' about leaving the business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he says he hopes to be around for a while. ``I would
tell my dad, `I think I'm on the cusp,' meaning `Lend me some
money,''' Wood said. ``But when I told him about the nomination, he
said, `You turned out to be right.''' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Houghton, who built the Signature Theater Company into one
of New York's more prominent Off Broadway theater companies, has
been named as the successor to Lloyd Richards as the artistic
director of the Eugene O'Neill National Playwrights Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Richards has led the annual conference in Waterford, Conn.,
since 1969. Among the plays developed under Richards' direction
include ``House of Blue Leaves'' and ``Fences.'' Houghton is to
continue as artistic director of the Signature.
</P>
<P>
   Bebe Neuwirth has signed to play the title role in this summer's
production of ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' at the Williamstown
Theater Festival in Williamstown, Mass. Also confirmed this week:
David Schwimmer (of the NBC sitcom ``Friends'') in ``The Glimmer
Brothers,'' and Barry Edelstein as director of ``As You Like It,''
starring Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute injection of cash from new investors or
ticket buyers, ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' will close on
Sunday, producers said Thursday. The revue opened April 25 to
generally poor reviews.

   Both are mired far down in the point standings, Marlin at 16th
and Nemechek at 38th.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sabates, that wasn't supposed to happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   After years of turmoil and changes on Team SABCO, Sabates
thought he had things under control. Cuban-born Sabates' revolving
door had spit out drivers, crew chiefs, mechanics, sponsors and
cars at a frantic pace until this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big mistake when I hired Robby Gordon. It set us back
three years,'' Sabates remarked. ``At the time, it seemed like the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very disruptive. I'm lucky nobody quit. He really
caused some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-the-leader mode, the leader being Rick Hendrick,
Sabates expanded from a one-car to a three-car team in 1997,
bringing in the talented but temperamental Gordon from the
open-wheel ranks as his lead driver.
</P>
<P>
   It never worked. Gordon acted like a prima donna from the start.
He trashed Sabates' operation and failed to last the season.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Sabates, who lives in Charlotte, N.C., struggled
to make his three-car team work, then dropped to two this season
when he lost one of his sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he admits going to three cars before he even had one
working well was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped in too quick,'' Sabates said. ``I thought I could
make it go. I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had too many distractions, and we were spread too thin in
the engine department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got much more stability this year,'' Sabates said. ``We
didn't lose a single person except for the group I had to let go
when we dropped the 46 (his third car, driven primarily by Jeff
Green in 1998).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite a more smoothly functioning operation, Sabates'
cars are still not competitive.
</P>
<P>
   That may reflect on the personnel. While Sabates has a
hard-working group led by team manager Tony Glover, who made a name
for himself when he was crew chief for Ernie Irvan and Marlin when
both won the Daytona 500, few teams match up to the likes of Jeff
Gordon, Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett and a couple others.
</P>
<P>
   And those are the teams you have to beat if you expect to win
races and championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about a championship right now. I'd be happy
if we can finish in the top 15,'' Sabates remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I feel we can do that. It takes time to build things back
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they hadn't been built very high to begin with.

`TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY' SUCCESS STORIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, May 13)  
(mk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because my daughter is 2, she didn't come to my office for Take
Our Daughters to Work Day, although I look forward to the time when
she's old enough to help me write an inviting lead or choose what
photographs to play with a centerpiece package.
</P>
<P>
   My 8-year-old son has been to my office several times, and by no
means do I intend to leave him out of what Mom does for a living.
In fact, the other day when I got my hair cropped short for summer,
he told me: ``You look good. You look like an editor. Like a boss
of someone.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But I see daughters benefiting from this special day, especially
the ones whose dads let them tag along. Our company's graphic
artist brought his 10-year-old daughter with him. They drew
together with markers and went out for pizza. And we all caught up
on fifth-grade fashion: clunky shoes and fluffy purses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year on Take Our Daughters day, which is always on the
fourth Thursday of April, I had a very special guest. A dear
friend, who had breast cancer, asked me to bring her daughter to
the paper because the child was interested in writing. We typed a
bit into the computers that morning, had a fun lunch, and even
bought a new Beanie Baby at a downtown boutique. (No woman's ever
too young to learn to fit in some errands over lunch break.) A poem
she wrote was published in the newspaper's poetry corner the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   The Ms. Foundation for Women, creators of the Take Our Daughters
to Work Day, have come out with a new book, ``Girls Seen and Heard:
52 Life Lessons for Our Daughters'' (Putnam, 1998, $12). The book
grew out of one belief: that girls were confident at 11, but
confused at 16. What happened in those five years?
</P>
<P>
   Well, puberty for one. An interest in boys. Body image. Emerging
sexuality. And a growing awareness of what the world expects of
them.
</P>
<P>
   These life lessons are intended to be ammunition against this
difficult time. Some of the ideas are tangible (a scrapbook to keep
track of activities, filled with crayons, markers, scissors, glue
and disposable camera to create a record of why ``I'm a girl worth
watching''). Others are starting points for discussions (moms and
daughters writing poetry together about memories past; making a
list of ``what's right about yourself;'' having ``dream update''
sessions.)
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of Take Our Daughters to Work success stories: A
group of girls who got their fathers' company to quit investing in
a tobacco company. Firefighters who had taken their sons to sit in
the firetrucks but never their daughters until one of the firemen
started participating in the event. Girls who developed a new
appreciation for how hard their parents worked and how important
their jobs are as nurses and teachers and truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also anecdotes of girlhoods gone awry, which
suggest some steps that might have prevented tragedies like alcohol
poisoning, an arrest for drug dealing or unprotected sex. One idea
emphasized repeatedly is to get preteen girls involved in
after-school activities that keep them active and interested, and
give them a place to belong, such as band, karate or soccer. Many
of the lessons are for the parents too _ a reminder that our
children learn from watching us. Dare to live a creative,
fulfilling life, and your daughters will believe that it can be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why adults are always asking kids what they want to
be when they grow up?'' asks comedian Paula Poundstone. ``'Cause
they're looking for ideas.''

 &HT;    Discovering Japan's Three Beautiful Scenic Views
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a place, on a mountaintop, overlooking a band of sand
stretching across an ocean bay, where the Japanese go to see the
mythical Bridge to Heaven. It's a remote spot, called
Amanohashidate, revered as the place where creation gods spilled
jeweled drops of brine to form the islands of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have hiked up the mountain, wearing kimonos, for
centuries. Today, they can ride a cable car to a special viewing
platform.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the mountaintop, those who truly want to ``see'' the
bridge in the sea below must perform a time-honored ritual. They
turn their backs to the water. They bend over at the waist. And
they gaze from between their legs _ looking at the world upside
down and backwards _ at the panorama spread out before them.
</P>
<P>
   This is the one place where Japan's world-famous rules of formal
etiquette don't apply. Dozens of giggling Japanese bend over and
point their rear ends toward the sky to achieve the proper view of
the Miyazu Bay and the sacred, 2-mile long sand bar that arches
across it. When seen upside down and backward, this crescent of
sand seems to float in a blue sky, a sacred bridge with no
beginning or end.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge to Heaven may be an optical illusion, but it is so
important to the Japanese that it is designated one of the Three
Beautiful Scenic Views of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Travel books don't give much ink to this triumvirate of beauty,
known in the Japanese language as the ``Nihon Sankei.'' The three
natural sites are not the familiar cultural icons the world
associates with Japan. Majestic Mt. Fuji didn't make the list.
Neither did the carefully raked gravel meditation gardens of the
Zen monks or the spectacular cherry blossoms that inspire haiku
contests.
</P>
<P>
   The list seems as unlikely as an American ``tally of grandeur''
that rejects the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and the towering
Sequoias.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Japan's list is perfectly Japanese. It embraces what is not
conspicuous. It captures a beauty laced with an essence of
subtlety. Like the unhurried washing of a ceramic cup that turns a
tea ceremony into a work of art. Or the Japanese archery
tournaments that award more points for the slow, precise pulling of
the bow than for hitting the bull's eye.
</P>
<P>
   A personal quest
</P>
<P>
   I knew nothing about the three views until I went to Japan for a
fellowship program sponsored by the Japan Society in New York City.
A small mention of the scenic views in a guidebook caught my
attention because each location was within hailing distance from a
major city I was scheduled to visit.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. Visiting these three beautiful spots became my
personal quest. In my mind, I chanted their names so often that the
exotic-sounding titles became a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most honorable places:
</P>
<P>
   Miyajima, an island near Hiroshima where a giant, red shrine
gate stands in the bay and appears to float at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushima, a collection of pine-covered islands off the coast
of Northern Japan so beguiling that Matsuo Basho, the father of
haiku, could say nothing more than ``Matsushima, Ah! Matsushima!
Matsushima!'' when he visited in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Bridge to Heaven, the sand bar that's covered with
gnarled pines in a bay off the Sea of Japan, three hours by train
from the ancient temple city of Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   During a four-month stay, I never met anyone in Japan who had
visited all three sights. Their far-flung locations _ one on the
Pacific Coast, one in the Inland Sea and another off the Sea of
Japan _ makes it difficult to hit all three. Most Japanese use
their scant vacation time to revisit their favorite shrine or
family in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew about the three beautiful places, but no one could
tell me who had selected the sights. Or why. Or when. Like so many
other things in Japan, the list of the three most scenic views was
just accepted as official because it had been designated so.
</P>
<P>
   But as I pinpointed the three places on a map of Japan, a common
theme appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Water.
</P>
<P>
   Each scenic view focuses on an object floating in water, the
life force most cherished by the Japanese. Every aspect of Japanese
culture is tied to water _ food, tea ceremony, flower arranging,
papermaking, rice paddies, cloth dying, gardening and the long
luxury of the bathhouse. The imagery of water is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even Japan's most famous haiku, by Basho, embraces water:
</P>
<P>
   ``The old pond _
</P>
<P>
   a frog jumps in,
</P>
<P>
   sound of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is an island nation, and the sea that kept the Japanese
samurai world isolated from the West until Commodore Matthew Perry
arrived in 1853 is still shaping the national character. Japan has
become one of the world's most advanced countries, unleashing
robots and Walkmen, but its people are still in tune with the
rhythms of the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mizu'' is the Japanese word for water. Mizu is sacred and holy
and honorable. Mizu is the beautiful in the Three Beautiful Scenic
Views.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangement of form is at the heart of the Japanese aesthetic.
The Japanese appreciate not only beautiful objects, but also the
spacing between them. ``One looks not only at trees and leaves
themselves, but at the shapes and areas of sky they enclose, not
only at the distribution of stones on a beach, but the water and
sand between,'' American artist Frances Blakemore wrote in 1975
when she had an art gallery in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Japan's three official beautiful views allows visitors
to contemplate the relationship between the land and the sea, how
one cannot be without the other.
</P>
<P>
   But I found more than visual beauty at the three sites. Each one
revealed a key aspect of Japanese heritage and offered cultural
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermilion gate
</P>
<P>
   At Miyajima, I came face-to-face with Shinto, the indigenous
religion of Japan that predates Buddhism. Miyajima is home to a
large Shinto shrine, Itsukushima Jinja, originally built in 593 and
dedicated to the deities of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In Shintoism, all natural things are believed to possess a
spiritual side. Shinto honors gods of nature, but offers no
doctrine. It is an ancient religion of ceremony, and gods are
honored with performance of rituals. Worshipers must purify
themselves before entering a shrine by washing their hands and
mouth at a special pavilion. At the main shrine hall, visitors toss
donations into a box, pull a rope that rings a bell, clap three
times and bow to the gods.
</P>
<P>
   Miyajima's prime object of enduring beauty is the 53-foot
vermilion gateway that stands sentry in the bay in front of the
shrine. The gate's beauty is affected by the tides. At high tide,
the formidable gate, called a ``torii,'' appears to be floating on
the water. At night, the archway shimmers under floodlights.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, all boats arriving at Miyajima had to pass
through the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The area had the feel of a tourist trap, with souvenir shops and
food vendors around every corner. But the giant red torii in the
water, more elaborately carved than most shrine gates, kept
catching my eye. It seemed to pulsate as a beacon to keep me
focused on the shrine and the sacredness of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Islands in the bay
</P>
<P>
   The second beautiful scenic spot, Matsushima, highlighted the
geography of isolation that has shaped so much of Japan's culture,
a way of life based for centuries on separateness from the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushima is a bay filled with more than 250 small islands that
dot the sea like flotillas of runaway Christmas tree lots. Each
islet is a different size and shape, and some have natural arches
that a sightseeing boat can pass through. They stretch into the far
horizon and seem to keep going on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the islands is like looking at pint-sized replicas of
the larger Japanese islands. People in Japan are proud of their
island heritage, but the four main islands are so big it is
difficult to get the sense of an archipelago when you are on them.
The Matsushima islands are a humbling reminder of the passage of
time and the evolution of land masses.
</P>
<P>
   In Matsushima, I headed up one of the tallest hills in town to
catch the same view seen by Basho, who made a pilgrimage to
Matsushima in the late 1600s. Today, part of the view is marred by
the smokestacks of a nearby power plant, but islands floating on
the horizon still hold an aura of exotic Japanese mystique.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge to Heaven
</P>
<P>
   The third beautiful view, Amanohashidate, the Bridge to Heaven,
was my stepping stone to Japanese mythology, which modern Japanese
continue to hold dear. The creation of Japan is attributed to a
male and female god who stood on the Amanohashidate sand bar in the
dawn of time and stirred sea water with a jeweled spear. The
droplets formed an island where they married and begat more gods of
nature, including deities of the oceans, moon and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese myth merged into history in the year 500 when the first
emperor of Japan claimed to be the son of a god. Until the end of
World War II, the emperor of Japan and his imperial family were
considered to be descendants of the gods. Even today, the emperor
conducts secret rituals at harvest time in which he is supposed to
mate with the earth goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Amanohashidate is perched on a fishing bay off the Sea of Japan.
The town is divided by the famous sand bar that forms the legendary
Bridge to Heaven. The sand spit is just 2 miles long and only 66
feet wide in some places. As I walked the tree-shaded trail, the
breeze that caresses the tall pines filled the air with a soft
symphony of whispers.
</P>
<P>
   I rode a cable car up the mountain to the Bridge to Heaven
viewing platforms with a Japanese tour group. We walked together to
the edge of the mountainside, but no one wanted to be the first to
bend over in front of the crowd. A few awkward minutes passed
before modesty gave way to mirth and the bending over began.
</P>
<P>
   When I took my turn, I couldn't see the Bridge to Heaven right
away. All I saw was a big sand bar looming behind me. But then I
remembered the instructions to look only at the view that appeared
between my legs. Suddenly, the sand bar was framed and centered. I
squinted to blur the view a bit, and then the image of an ancient
bridge began to shimmer before me.
</P>
<P>
   Folded into the ultimate Japanese bow, I learned that beauty
appears to those willing to look for it. Even when it's upside down
and backward.

IS TEEN BOY A THREAT OR A VICTIM?

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Days before the massacre at Columbine High School in
Colorado, 14-year-old Tim Murphy turned in a fictional story, a
fairy tale, for a class at Pioneer Elementary School in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Tim is an eighth-grader, an athlete, but he's not the best
student. He had trouble coming up with an idea for his story.
</P>
<P>
   His mother says a friend of Tim's in the same class decided to
base his fairy tale on the teen TV show ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.'' The friend's's story was called ``The Teacher Slayer.''
It was meant also to be a take-off on a movie called ``The
Faculty,'' in which teachers at a high school turn out to be space
aliens who are destroyed by students. (``The Republic's'' Bob
Fenster called it ``a gore fest.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tim's mother, Kristin, says her son took the idea for his own
fairy tale from that of his pal. Tim's story was titled, ``The
Wicked Teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, a teacher who appears nice at first turns out to be a
witch who attacks the protagonist. Tim's tale reads in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``She sliced his finger off and tackled him. She tore his flesh
with her teeth and just then a couple of his friends came in and
just happened to have a shotgun. The teacher was just about to kill
Joey when, boom! The teacher's head was in about sixty million
pieces on the wall.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
MASS HYSTERIA
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long after turning in the assignment, Tim received a 10-day
suspension for ``written statements that threaten the safety of
school staff.'' Today, he faces a long-term suspension hearing that
could keep him from ever returning to Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so emotionally distraught over this,'' Kristin said. ``I
know my son. I know he's not a threat to anyone. The fact they're
trying to link my son to that type of behavior is really horrifying
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tim's mom, at least one teacher with whom Tim has
had trouble in the past has gone outside the school disciplinary
process to file a complaint with the police over Tim's fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that there is a mass hysteria linking this to
what happened at Columbine High School,'' she said. ``I want to
protect our children as much as anyone, but I'm afraid we're going
to wildly overreact.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course we are.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we do in America. We ignore problems until it's too
late, then respond in a way that's completely out of proportion.
It'll happen soon in schools across the land.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin read Tim's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was bad judgment on my part not making him change
it,'' she said. But, she added, Tim's class has read stories by
Stephen King in school. And he watches movies and TV, like every
American boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took down my copy of `Grimm's Fairy Tales,' '' she
said. ``They're as gory as it gets. But that doesn't mean the Grimm
brothers killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Denton Santarelli, a Peoria School District official, told me
Wednesday that he couldn't discuss specifics of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' he said, ``because of (Colorado) there is an
emotional reaction to perceived threats. Our responsibility is to
try to separate that out, keeping in mind that the ultimate goal is
to benefit all the children, including the child who may have used
poor judgment. &QL; 
THE FEAR EQUATION
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the suspension hearing ``is to make sure we have all the
facts. That we're not overreacting, we're not underreacting, we're
considering all the factors most relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The most relevant factor is fear.
</P>
<P>
   Tim's friend had his hearing and received a long-term
suspension. Tim's mother worries that her boy also will be
banished. Not because he's a danger, but because it makes school
officials feel as if they're doing something _ (begin ital)
``anything'' (end ital) _ about the problem of teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are afraid. Teachers are afraid. Administrators are
afraid of appearing weak or ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   After watching coverage of the massacre at Colorado's Columbine
High School on the day it happened, Kristin said Tim told his
parents he was afraid to return to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I convinced him it would be OK,'' Kristin said.
``We told him his school was completely safe.'' &QL;

   Merve Kavakci had to have expected that her appearance in the
Turkish Parliament wearing a navy blue head cloth would provoke a
strong negative reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly she was not prepared for the explosion of shouted
insults, rhythmic clapping and cries of ``Out! Out!'' that assailed
her there.
</P>
<P>
   She could not have imagined that Premier Bulent Ecevit would be
so incensed that he would demand of the speaker of the Parliament,
``Please put this lady in her place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit then delivered an impassioned speech affirming the right
of individuals to exercise their private rights in private without
interference from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not a private space. This is the supreme
foundation of the state. It is not a place in which to challenge
the state,'' said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
   Kemal Ataturuk, the founder of the Turkish republic, would have
been proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   Kavakci didn't get sworn in. The speaker called a recess, and
Kavakci didn't return when the session resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that over a head scarf?'' you ask. Well, it was not the
garment per se that was found to be so offensive. It was what it
represented in the eyes of those assembled _ a throwback to the
past, a threat to the tradition of secularism in government that
Turkey's political and military leaders view as crucial to
preserving freedom and propelling the continuing modernization of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kavakci belongs to the religion-centered Virtue Party, which is
cut from the same cloth as the outlawed Welfare Party. Welfare was
banned last year for being anti-secular. To the powers that be in
Turkey, that is the same thing as being subversive.
</P>
<P>
   With her headgear, Kavakci was making a statement about her
Islamic faith. She was one of two scarf-wearing women elected to
Parliament last month. The other woman chose not to wear her scarf
to Parliament and drew thunderous applause from the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Kavakci insists that she will return and be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pledge my allegiance to the secular republic. What
difference does my head scarf make?'' she asked in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she knows what difference it makes. And surely she
knows that she never will receive her oath of office if she insists
on wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is the distinct possibility that Kavakci could
go to jail for her sartorial defiance.
</P>
<P>
   The wearing of head scarves by women, which is required in some
Muslim countries, is not prohibited outright in Turkey. But civil
servants can't wear them, and they can't be worn in courtrooms and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no law or rule specifically prohibiting
wearing them in Parliament, the very idea _ until Kavakci's
audacious display _ was considered unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Kavakci now faces the possibility of doing some serious jail
time because prosecutors have launched an investigation of the
American-educated computer scientist, with a view to charging her
with inciting religious hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks, 95 percent of whom are Muslims, have taken the issue
of separation of state and mosque very seriously ever since
Ataturk, 75 years ago, established the secular republic, abolished
the religious caliphate and called for banning the scarf, the veil
and the fez.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about maintaining that separation has been intensified
in recent years by the rise of religious fundamentalism in the
Islamic world. The Turkish ruling elite has only to look next door
at Iran to conjure up frightening visions of a day when women in
their country would be required to wear the scarf.
</P>
<P>
   There is a message in this for Americans. Some in this country
would tear away the partition between church and state that the
founders of this secular republic so painstakingly erected.
</P>
<P>
   They don't form political parties. But they do organize, pool
their resources and exert their combined leverage to bend parties
and candidates to their religiously motivated will.
</P>
<P>
   In this secular republic (under God), they have every right to
exercise their political influence to push such policies as
government subsidies for religious schools, prayer and the teaching
of creationism in public schools, and prohibiting all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God that in this country the religious organizations that
push those and other policies that would breach the church-state
wall cannot be banned and that individuals cannot be jailed for
such advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their continuing assaults upon the wall do threaten the
right of all Americans to believe, profess and worship as they
choose. America's versions of Turkey's woman who wore her scarf in
the wrong place must be continually challenged and put in their
place.

STALKING THAT RARE RECORDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Take pity on the next generation of music fiends, for
they may not know the pleasure of loitering in little record
stores.
</P>
<P>
   People in their 20s, 30s and 40s, less and less guilty about
shopping on the Internet, are regularly denying themselves the
chance to go into a record shop and just look. In their defense,
they complain that the clerks don't know the stock or know too much
and beam out rays of fringe-scholar intimidation. Or buyers talk
about what a waste of time it has become to go to a real store,
although some of the bigger virtual record shops on line say
they've got stock when they don't and end up sending out records
six months later or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   As a suburban teen-ager within bus distance of New York, I did a
lot of growing up on my trips in the early 1980s to specialist
record stores, looking for funk, jazz, rock and punk. I discovered
new neighborhoods, learned how to hold my own with older people,
discovered places to eat and figured out whom I didn't want to talk
to. I realize now with a sense of alarm what I might have lost if I
had had access to the Internet with its current level of
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   I also contracted a mild form of the itch that still strikes
when I see some long-coveted record or CD: the sensory love of the
object. There's something about record stores, as kiosks of
information, as places where you can learn about style, slang, art
and sound, that I will never want to reject, no matter how much I
struggle against the idea that records, as opposed to performance,
can properly teach you about music.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still a place for independent, specialist record
stores in New York, despite the increasing availability of almost
anything on line and the increasing dominance of chain stores like
Tower, HMV and Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the ethnic and social profile of a neighborhood
supports a store; sometimes a store presents a certain style so
well and completely that one wouldn't want to go anywhere else to
find it. Sometimes it's just a heady pit stop, the equivalent of a
barbershop or cafe. Sometimes the stores become the origin of the
music, not just the middlemen, as more record shops move into
distributing hard-to-find records or just setting up their own
record label. Each one of those CDs sent around the world is
publicity for the store, and they're cheaper when you buy them at
the source.
</P>
<P>
   I recently spent several pleasant days around the city
revisiting some independent record stores, retailers of mostly new
records. These stores have survived the dark days through
specialization and fearsome knowledge of their own product. Almost
all the stores below serve customers by mail order; some are
getting a leg up on their competition by establishing Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   African Music
</P>
<P>
   To walk into Roger Francis' AFRICAN RECORD CENTER is to
experience that rare feeling of knowing that you did, in fact, get
there before some other people. You can't believe you're seeing
these racks full of pasteboard-cover LPs. Francis, a Brooklynite,
has owned the African Record Center in East Flatbush since 1968,
and from the beginning made trips to Africa to import the music. He
started the Makossa label, which he runs out of the back room; his
was the first place where records by Manu Dibango, Fela Kuti,
Franco and others could be found in New York. He has also organized
American tours for some African artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We introduced African music to the United States,'' said
Francis, not quite suppressing a grin. ``I will make that statement
humbly but boastfully at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   He still keeps racks full of Nigerian, Ghanaian, Ethiopian,
Cameroonian, Zairian, Haitian and Cuban LPs as well as CDs. Zouk
music, from Martinique, is his bread and butter these days.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' brother Rudy runs the Yoruba Book Center, two blocks
away, which specializes in books of the black diaspora. Its wares
include the entire catalog of the local Athelia Henrietta Press,
which publishes books on Yoruban religion and culture. The bookshop
also sells hard-to-find LPs of African and Haitian music, and its
biggest sellers are cassettes of Yoruban religious music.
</P>
<P>
   The best seller at African Record Center is ``Soukous
Vibrations, Vol. 5'' (Afro-Rhythms). I bought Lafayette Afro Rock
Band's ``Voodounon'' (Editions Makossa), an LP, for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Music
</P>
<P>
   A chain store has moved in one block away from BATE, one of the
city's oldest Latin-music stores, on Delancey Street on the Lower
East Side. It makes Anna and Dominick Torres, owners of 31-year-old
Bate, a little worried, as does the changing profile of the
neighborhood; it's no longer the Latin stronghold it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   But Bate has something that many chains don't: back-catalog
items. In the rear of the store _ it's really two stores in one,
with a separate counter for the rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop
section _ the racks are deep with Fania, Harlequin and Tumbao, the
collector labels of salsa. It's one of the few places in the city
with a decent supply of Cuban music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, six years before the Torreses started Bate, Cristina
Barreiro's father, Alfonso Rubio, opened CASA LATINA, a Latin-music
record store on East 116th Street in East Harlem. Rubio, who died
in 1978, was an Argentine tailor who fled Buenos Aires with his
family when President Juan Peron decided to widen Avenida de Mayo
and gave merchants 24 hours to vacate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '62, when my mother died,'' Ms. Barreiro said, ``he wanted
me to have a place that I could go to after school. So I used to
leave school and come to the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barreiro has been working at the store since 1966; she now
runs the place with her husband, Vicente. The long, deep store,
full of CDs, books, videos and percussion instruments, is becoming
a city landmark. With the recent closing of the Record Mart in
Times Square, Bate and Casa Latina are the best-stocked Latin music
stores in the city; they're also both places where you can sing a
fragment of a song you've heard on the radio, and the owners will
decipher and name it for you.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente's a walking computer,'' Ms. Barreiro said. ``Other
stores used to call Casa Latina when a customer didn't know what he
was looking for, and Vicente would help out. But he had to stop
doing that. Now he just tells them that we have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Casa Latina also sells congas, bongos, guiros and shekeres, as
well as concert videos and books on salsa and Afro-Cuban music.
</P>
<P>
   At Casa Latina the best seller is Tito Rojas' ``Alegria y
Penas'' (MP/Sony). I bought El Gran Combo's ``Pasaporte Musical''
(Combo) for $13.99.
</P>
<P>
   Rock and the Fringe
</P>
<P>
   ROCKIT SCIENTIST in the West Village feels familiar, like the
one-stop shops that flourished in the 1980s: small and narrow, a
one-man operation, with tightly pruned sections that try to
represent every strand of Western world hipsterism since 1955 or
so. John Kioussis, a former manager of Venus Records, presides
here, wedged between a cash register and turntable up front,
offering advice and filling the room with loud music.
</P>
<P>
   Every good record store is for snobs, but the genre pool in
Rockit Scientist tends toward the open-minded. Kioussis is
especially good on 1960s rock and soul, with respectable sections
of reggae and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER MUSIC in the East Village, many times bigger, gets deeply
into the outsider niche; anything nontraditional has rack space
here. It's startling to find the shop so full of people late on a
Sunday, milling around the brightly lighted store looking for
fringe culture.
</P>
<P>
   This shop was founded a little more than three years ago by
former clerks from the music section at Kim's Video on Bleecker
Street, and since then the staff has grown to 20 from 3. The store
now sells tickets to concerts around town, and the sections, like
the store's habitues, keep dividing further and further into
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   What was once ``electronic music'' now has separate sections for
German minimalists and Vienna composers; what was once called
``decadanse'' now has separate sections for Japanese, French and
Italian pop. (This is where you find retro flavors like the old
records by Lucio Battisti, Nico and Francoise Hardy.)
</P>
<P>
   The store is the only place to find a three-CD set by the Dutch
electronic composer Dick Raiijmakers; most of the records of the
late-'60s Brazilian Tropicalia movement, or the beautifully
packaged ``Tarot'' album by the German musician Walter Wegmuller.
One of the success stories of alternative culture in New York, the
shop presents the corners exceedingly well and doesn't bother at
all with the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The best seller at Other Music is Tom Waits' new album, ``Mule
Variations'' (Epitath). I bought Oval's ``Szenario'' (Tokuma), an
import CD, for $22.99. Reggae
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, everyone wanted to be in a band,'' said
Ira Heaps, the proprietor of the reggae record shop JAMMYLAND in
the East Village. ``Now everyone wants to be a DJ.''
</P>
<P>
   So he changed his shop, which had been open since 1993,
accordingly. Then, around 1996 he noticed that dub music _ extended
remixes of reggae songs with deep echo and tape-edit
experimentation _ had taken on a different meaning, bridging with
the new electronic music. So he began to specialize in dub and
stock as much vinyl as CDs; he may soon be the manufacturer and
distributor of the vinyl albums from Blood and Fire, the English
dub label.
</P>
<P>
   Jammyland, narrow, plentiful and homey _ there's an exposed
kitchen in the back _ carries a small amount of African music and
electronic dance music. But what makes it special is its supply of
records on labels like Justice League, Reggae Retro and Clocktower,
which aren't available at chains.
</P>
<P>
   The best seller is Augustus Pablo's ``This is Augustus Pablo''
(Above Rock Music/Jammyland). I bought that CD for $11.99.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-Hop
</P>
<P>
   There are two DJ booths at BEAT STREET in downtown Brooklyn, and
three full-time DJs, all continually pumping out loud hip-hop and
reggae beats through enormous speakers. Amazingly, they don't quite
clash; the downstairs space is that wide and deep. And students of
rhythm are always standing around the booths. Beat Street is
hip-hop central; this is where DJs shop and where they can walk out
with stacks of old breakbeat records as well as what's just hit the
street.
</P>
<P>
   This is also where you find a full complement of kung fu videos,
the new Missy Elliott single or a copy of Herman Kelly's ``Dance to
the Drummer's Beat,'' which is to an old-school hip-hop DJ set what
tomatoes are to chili.
</P>
<P>
   The best seller is Nas' ``I Am . . .'' (Columbia). I bought
ESG's, ``Come Away With ESG'' (99), an LP, for $10.99.
</P>
<P>
   Arabic
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Rashid inherited his record-and-video store, RASHID'S in
Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, from his father, Albert, a Lebanese
businessman who made soundtrack records from popular Arabic films
and worked as an agent in the United States for the Egyptian singer
Mohammed Abdel Wahab. The family opened up shop in the mid-1960's
and established, as Rashid likes to say, the largest collection of
Arabic records in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid's is a distributor as well, responsible for most of the
Arabic CDs that end up in the chain stores; it's the place to seek
out first for CDs by popular singers like Amr Diab or a collection
of CDs by the singer Ahmed Adawiia, which were banned in Egypt
because of risque lyrics. In a black velvet case, the store sells a
72-CD boxed set ($795) of the later work of Oum Kalsoum, ``the
daughter of the Nile,'' who may be Egypt's most popular musician of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The best seller is Ragheb Aleme's ``Alby Eshekha'' (Ahmed Moussa
&AMP; Co.). I bought Ahmad Fathi's ``Ya Bou Zaid'' (Al Jazira), a CD,
for $14.98.

WAY UP IN THE BRONX A HARDY SPIRIT BLOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Information on the sites mentioned in this article is at end
of 3rd take.) 
(js) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Art in the Bronx, like the sprawling borough itself,
is a resilient, clamorous, multifaceted thing, cosmopolitan in
outlook but imbued with a spirit of place.
</P>
<P>
   It embraces forms from video installations to virtuosic
aerosol-spray murals. And it turns up in unexpected places: in
school hallways, hospital lobbies, courtrooms, subway stations,
living rooms and _ officially, unofficially and often
heart-liftingly _ on building facades.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition spaces designed on the white-cube Manhattan model are
relatively few and far between. But they are determinedly there,
and so are artists, lots of them, some well known, others up and
coming, living and working throughout the borough.
</P>
<P>
   Their creative presence is tonic to a part of the city that has
suffered more than its share of political and economic sabotage
over the years and still battles stereotypes promoted by Hollywood
films like the 1981 ``Fort Apache, the Bronx'' and books like Tom
Wolfe's 1987 ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the borough remains a vulnerable
organism, but amazing things are in progress. The South Bronx is
being resurrected. (And the Grand Concourse remains pretty grand.)
Grass-roots community ventures of all kinds are flourishing. And so
is art, particularly in a handful of tenacious institutions, large
and small, that have settled in to stay. A few of them are
considered below.
</P>
<P>
   The social and cultural histories of the borough come across
with stirring immediacy in the show ``Urban Mythologies: The Bronx
Represented Since the 1960s,'' at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
Organized by Lydia Yee, a curator at the museum, and a guest
curator, Betti-Sue Hertz, the show, which comes with an excellent
catalog, is arranged chronologically and opens with pictures from
the early 1960s by Max Levine, a local photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Levine captured some newsworthy local events, like the campaign
visit of John F. Kennedy in 1960. But mostly he recorded daily life
in a borough that was still largely middle- and working-class
white. A Veterans Day parade marches on Tremont Avenue. John
Wayne's ``Hellfighter'' plays at the Earl Theater. A restaurant
fire is just a fire, not yet a dire symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs of the Puerto Rico-born Carlos Ortiz from a
decade later come as a shock. By the time they were taken, urban
renewal had splintered the borough. Poor populations, mostly black
and Latino, displaced from elsewhere, were pushed in. ``White
flight'' followed, with landlords torching buildings to collect
insurance. Basic services and amenities dried up. In Ortiz's
pictures, crowded sidewalks and houses are replaced by fog-covered
empty lots; in place of stores and vegetable stands there are trash
heaps. A visit by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 is greeted by
angry, out-of-work protesters standing in front of burned-out
tenements.
</P>
<P>
   A few Manhattan artists ventured into the borough. In 1970
Richard Serra created a temporary site-specific piece in the
Fordham section. But it was Gordon Matta-Clark, his political
sensibilities fine-tuned, who responded to the stressed, lived-in
texture of the area, as suggested by his cutout chunk of
linoleum-covered floor from an abandoned apartment, both a relic
and a monument.
</P>
<P>
   Such images, verifying a specific human presence, come
throughout the exhibition, in the photographs of Mel Rosenthal,
Ricky Flores and Walter Rosenblum, and in the incandescent,
life-size portraits by Sophie Rivera. And just as the borough's
media profile was darkening, a new art emerged, known by an old
name, graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti (or writing, as its practitioners prefer to call it) is
by now a textbook style; no survey of American art is complete
without it. And it appears in various forms in this show. Its
kinetic vitality is hinted at in photos by Henry Chalfant and
Martha Cooper depicting painted subway cars. Its inventive elegance
is caught in 1970s drawings by artists like Bama, Blade, Case 2,
Riff 170 and Tracy 168. (A selection of old and new work by the
last three is also on view at the Martinez Gallery, in Chelsea. )
</P>
<P>
   This art form is very much alive, although the Manhattan art
world seems to have been unaware of that until Barry McGee's recent
show at Deitch Projects in SoHo. The three-man ``graf'' team Tats
Cru, whose urbane, punchy work shows up on walls all over the South
Bronx, has created a mural for the show.
</P>
<P>
   As graffiti made its way to Manhattan in the 1970s, Manhattan
artists traveled to the Bronx. Many of them _ Jenny Holzer, Lisa
Kahane, Rebecca Howland, Justen Ladda, Christy Rupp, Kiki Smith and
others _ exhibited at the storefront gallery Fashion Moda,
established by the Austrian-born artist Stefan Eins in the South
Bronx. A few chose to settle in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was John Ahearn, who, with Rigoberto Torres, created
hundreds of life-size painted plaster casts of neighborhood
residents. Tim Rollins, a public-school teacher, collaborated with
a group of his students (their collective name was Kids of
Survival, or K.O.S.) on paintings based on literary themes. The
fantastic mix of cartoon and sci-fi images in the early piece
titled ``Frankenstein'' (1984) is painted directly on pages from
that Mary Shelley novel, itself a story of alienation and
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins is now back in residence in the South Bronx after a time
away. ( Ahearn and Torres have a workshop in East Harlem.) But
Pepon Osorio has lived, worked and exhibited in the area all along.
And his extraordinary, room-filling installation ``Scene of the
Crime (Whose Crime?),'' a version of which appeared in the 1993
Whitney Biennial, is a highlight of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a full-scale tableau of an apartment thrown into disarray.
The ornate furniture is slashed, ceramic religious statues and
vases are shattered; a sheet-covered woman's corpse lies on the
floor; yellow police tape keeps the viewer out. The piece carries a
charge of violence that much of the rest of the work in the
exhibition, apart from clips from sensationalist movies, avoids.
(Another exception is the grave, tender 1990 painting by Whitfield
Lovell recording the death of his grandfather at the hands of a
mugger.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Osorio has couched his drama in terms of intense material
beauty. It's a beauty traditionally associated not with high art
but with objects one might actually find in a home, things of
sentimental value, decorative items and status symbols that make
life seem richer, fuller and more secure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One sees such material more benignly presented in the wonderful
photographs of South Bronx domestic interiors and house-proud
owners taken by Camilo Jose Vergara. And through Vergara's pictures
and Osorio's disturbing installation a kind of art usually excluded
from museums finds its way into the exhibition, and another facet
of Bronx cultural life, seen only by its inhabitants, is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Museum has always acknowledged this indigenous,
multi-ethnic culture while keeping itself in sync with the wider
art world. And no doubt some sense of that delicate balance will be
evident in a two-day symposium that begins Friday at the museum.
Titled ``Urban Transformations: Style, Representation and Social
Change,'' it will bring together sociologists, artists, hip-hop
performers and scholars of urban planning in the kind of mix this
museum is famous for.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bronx Museum is the borough's flagship visual arts
showcase, it shares the limelight with a handful of others. These
include En Foco, the Lehman College Art Gallery, Longwood Arts
Gallery, Bronx River Art Center and Gallery, and the Hostos Center
for the Arts and Culture, which has a show of paintings by the
Bronx artist Moses Ros on view through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can get a taste of two premier Bronx spaces in one at
Lehman College in the Kingsbridge section, which is presenting both
an exhibition of its own and the 1998 Photography Award winners
exhibition sponsored by an organization called En Foco.
</P>
<P>
   En Foco was created 25 years ago to provide funds, materials and
exhibition opportunities for artists of African, Asian, Latino or
American Indian descent. Under the direction of Charles
Biasiny-Rivera and Miriam Romais it maintains a photographic
archive and publishes a quarterly magazine, Nueva Luz. It has no
gallery of its own but places the work of the artists it sponsors
in public locations. Some years ago, for example, it arranged an
installation of Sophie Rivera's portraits in the 161st Street
subway station.
</P>
<P>
   The four artists in the En Foco show at Lehman are a diverse lot
and come through with fine work. Andre Cypriano, born in Brazil,
documents life in a prison used to hold political radicals near Rio
de Janeiro. Suzanne K. Saylor, a Japanese-American, concentrates on
cemeteries in Hawaii, with their surreal accumulations of tropical
flowers and plastic toys.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaiman Ellison, Bronx born, offers a series of pictures taken
over 15 years or so and centered on the Orthodox Christian church
in Ethiopia, with resplendently robed clergy and revered pilgrimage
sites like the rock-cut churches at Lalibela, to which Ellison made
arduous repeated trips. Finally, Terry Boddie, born on the island
of Nevis in the Caribbean, stretches the photographic medium by
combining vintage pictures of family members with monoprint forms
of pictographs and tropical plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehman Gallery, established in 1984, programs consistently
stimulating, technology-savvy shows under the direction of Susan
Hoeltzel. It is at work on a two-year project to catalog on the
Internet all public art in the Bronx, from the 19th century to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman is offering a one-man survey of the Bronx-born conceptual
and video artist Peter d'Agostino. Organized by Robert Atkins, it
begins with his early work with television and moves on to
ambitious installations, including an interactive virtual
environment in video form. The piece feels a little like a
large-scale digital war game and is implicitly critical of the
lulling, distancing effects of the technology it uses.
</P>
<P>
   More recent is a split-screen projected online work,
``su.Vius,'' which pairs scenes of the Arthur Avenue section of the
Bronx, where d'Agostino grew up, with shots of Pompeii and Mount
Vesuvius near Naples, where his parents were born. The contrast
between clips of Bronx street life and the ruined avenues of
Pompeii is a quiet study in transience and the preservation of
cultural memory. The Web address for the piece
(www.temple.edu/-newtechlab/Vesu.Vius) requires upper lower case.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood Arts Project, an arm of the Bronx Council on the Arts,
has operated for 18 years on one floor of a former public school in
the South Bronx. Its director, Eddie Torres, organized the current
show of five artists, four of whom worked on Longwood studio
fellowships this year.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Serna's spare, linear paintings are based on figures
inspired by Japanese prints. Jehanne-Marie Gavarini's sculptures
use industrial tubing and sheer fabrics to convey a sense of
constrained sexuality. Esperanza Cortes' labor-intensive sculptures
are based on chains stitched from tiny glass beads. One piece,
suspended from the ceiling and hung with handmade amulets and
charms, has a dense but attenuated presence.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Sonpon, a graduate student at the Rhode Island School of
Design, ambitiously juggles several projects at once. He has two
short, effective videos about racial identity in the show and
another about the history of his own Philadelphia neighborhood in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view are brushy paintings by Nicholas A. Enright, which
incorporate stenciled colloquial phrases (``come rain or come
shine,'' ``here's a piece of my mind'') that are meant to form an
extended poem. Enright and his business partner, Nils Folke
Anderson (they call themselves the Big Hands Mural Company) have
also created the snakelike rubber-stamped mural that spirals across
a hallway wall.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood will be downsizing after this year. Fellows will work
primarily in cyberspace (although the computers are not yet in
place). And much of the existing studio will be given back to the
city for different uses.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The show titled ``Directors' Choices,'' organized by Amir Bey at
the Bronx River Art Center, includes work selected by the six
artists who have been in charge of the center since it opened in a
converted factory building in Tremont in 1980. All but one of them
_ Betti-Sue Hertz, who also ran the Longwood Art Project for
several years _ pair their own work with that of the artists they
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Wilde-Biasiny has gathered together work by members of
another local organization, Bronx Printmakers Workshop, and
supplemented them with her own print series, ``Resurgence/Notes
From the South Bronx,'' which layers images of flowers and urban
buildings. The artists include Edgar Buonagurio, Aaron Olshan,
Alejandra Delfin, Michelle Godwin, Lauri Ourlicht, Hilary Lorenz
and Dino Blanche.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Seeney matches her small, dense emblematic sculptures with
armorlike wax clothing pieces by Anna Lascari. Noah Jemison's
abstract encaustic painting pairs nicely with a conceptual photo
piece on bees by Kathleen McCarthy. Walter C. Jackson has chosen
drawings by Calvin Reid to accompany his own multimedia political
installation; the center's new director, Gail Nathan, joins her
figurative painting with delicate collages by Andrea Callard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hertz has chosen work by Asian-born artists whom she
introduced at the center during her tenure in 1984. This includes
art by Ken Hirotsuka, Masao Gozu and Toyo Tsuchiya, and a lovely
hanging of woven paper by Kazuko, who has long run an alternative
space of her own, 128 Gallery, on Rivington Street on the Lower
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In Hunts Point, not far from the Longwood gallery, is a buzzing
center of multimedia activity known as the Point. It was founded
three years ago by four community organizers; one of them, Paul
Lipson, who grew up in the neighborhood in the 1960s, is its
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a low, meandering 1911 building once owned by American
Banknote Co., the Point has a theater, a ``cyber-cafe,'' classrooms
and offices, and it cooks up a daunting weekly schedule of
instruction and entertainment, much of it free, ranging from jazz
concerts, films and poetry slams to classes in the martial arts and
dance. (Classical ballet, flamenco, and hip-hop are all taught, the
last by no less a luminary than the performer Richard Colon, known
as Crazy Legs.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no art gallery on the premises, but the Point has
overseen the installation of a small sculpture garden in a shopping
district a few blocks away; it plans to establish another one on
the riverfront. A nearby factory building has been fitted out as
studio space for artists, and within the complex itself the
graffiti group Tats Cru has its cramped headquarters, a tiny museum
in itself with a display of works by old-school ``graf'' masters.
In short, the Point is doing a lot, and it seems to be doing it
right. It may add up to a model for other ventures in the borough
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Tats Cru's work can seen throughout the Hunts Point and Longwood
neighborhoods in the form of memorial murals and commissioned
advertisements for local businesses. The Bronx is rich in public
art of all kinds. Here's a sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Subway riders will want to be on the alert for Jose Ortega's
sparkling ceramic mosaic murals, ``One Race, One World, One
Universe'' (1996), an MTA Arts for Transit commission at the Third
Avenue and 149th Street station of the No. 2 and 5 lines.
</P>
<P>
   Among recently finished projects under the auspices of the
city's Percent for Art Program, two are in the Rafael
Vinoly-designed Bronx Housing Court on the Grand Concourse a few
blocks above the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Two stern, funny Statue
of Liberty paintings by Komar and Melamid are in the lobby. (Don't
miss Renee Cox's fabulous nude version of the same figure in the
museum's show.) And archeological murals titled ``Memories of the
Bronx'' by Jorge Tacla are in an upstairs courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan art world seems to disparage public art as an
irrelevant, sentimental genre, but a reality-check tour of the
Bronx suggests otherwise. And one might start with a look at two
low-key pieces by John Fekner and Janet Zweig now in place at
Walton High School, near the Lehman College campus. (Information on
accessibility here is available by calling the Percent for Art
offices.)
</P>
<P>
   Fekner's etched metal plaques carry portraits of historical
figures _ Emily Dickinson, Jose Marti, Walt Disney, Diego Rivera,
Jim Thorpe, the educator Mary McLeod Bethune _ whom the students
and teachers in this troubled school selected as their cultural
heroes and whose faces they will pass every day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zweig's work takes the form of two banks of cast bronze
mailboxes in the school's lobby. Each box has a letter slot and is
etched with a single word: Secrets, Fears, Dreams and so on.
Students are invited to drop notes in them. The principal, Nichola
Jenco, said the response has been strong, and the results will
eventually be published as a book, the annals of Walton High.
</P>
<P>
   It should be an amazing document: the collective, first-person
history, told at the end of one century and the beginning of
another, of a new generation of New Yorkers. They will, after all,
be determining the future of many things, including that of the
Bronx itself, a borough in which secrets, fears and sky-high dreams
mingle.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANALYZE THIS,' starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.
Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and
teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down,
so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a
mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is hilarious simply by
playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His
mobster finds just the right comic foil in Crystal, as the
psychiatrist who utters the immortal, ``When I got into family
therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more
where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by
Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian
gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy.
There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of
Salles' film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a
fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly
to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles
brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate
their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one
of last year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `COOKIE'S FORTUNE,' starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Neal and Julianne Moore. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13,
118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit
of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a
Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely
enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old
woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms.
Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and
the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and appealing.
The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman makes the
most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,' starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with
English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELECTION,' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.
Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically
funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic satire of the
American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading
candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a
mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and
Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who
thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the
hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a
style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping
all the characters a few beats off of what they actually mean
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ENTRAPMENT,' starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper film
summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice
among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking
insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Connery's
glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast
and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the
outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma
to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action
sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's
largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a
nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EXISTENZ,' starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. Directed
by David Cronenberg (R, 90 minutes). Not for Cronenberg is the
sleek futuristic look of other films that play virtual reality
games. This one has the insinuatingly ghoulish hallmarks of other
Cronenberg fever dreams (like ``The Fly,'' ``Crash'' and ``Naked
Lunch''). And it uses them to weirdly enveloping effect as a
renowned game designer (Ms. Leigh) and her wary companion (Law) try
to play the most dangerous game she has yet created. This sci-fi
scheme is disturbingly effective as it plays its own mind games
with the viewer, complete with a sharp final twist. The title is
pronounced ``eggs-is-tense'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GO,' starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant,
Taye Diggs, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by Doug Liman (R, 100
minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy borrows truckloads
of inspiration from ``Pulp Fiction,'' but still has some flash and
personality of its own. Liman, who shot the film as well as
directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends a sullen
cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. He embellishes this
situation fully enough to send his film down the rabbit hole into
neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go to Las Vegas, then
get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car theft and a
brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than others. The
ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HIDEOUS KINKY,' starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies
MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes). Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on
this offbeat, richly atmospheric adventure in the wake of
``Titanic.'' The leading role in MacKinnon's vividly colorful film
offers her a field day. She plays a young hippie mother who brings
her reluctant British daughters to Marrakesh, circa 1972. The film,
about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction and the sheer
headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the striking subgenre
in which it is baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need
to come of age (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE,' starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence. Directed by
Ted Demme (R, 105 minutes). Though it's hard to miss the basic
unfunniness of seeing two black men sentenced to life at a
Mississippi state prison, this mild-mannered comedy is more likable
than it sounds. If it awkwardly straddles the line between period
piece (it begins during Prohibition) and comedy, it also keeps the
stars kidding their way from youth to curmudgeonhood. Murphy in
particular gives a more substantial performance than might be
expected here. Stick around for closing outtakes that show (for
instance) a cell phone ringing during a scene set in 1932 (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,'starring Jason Flemyng,
Dexter Fletcher, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy
Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since ``The Usual Suspects'' has
there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single
film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that
bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials,
actually an advantage for a change. There's not much beneath the
surface here. What's most entertaining is Ritchie's droll,
hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he
has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants
and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot
straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne.
Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The
time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but
incomprehensible to nontechnofreaks. And the film borrows
unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt
to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the storytelling
is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special,
notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying
gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while
behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill
Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a
couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing
marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of
virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PUSHING TIN,' starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton,
Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Mike Newell (R, 115
minutes). This story of air traffic controllers betrays its origins
as a magazine article because it has more interesting data than
built-in drama. But with a cast like this, and with the director of
``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' at the helm, the tacked-on soapy
plot has plenty of sparks. Cusack and Thornton, both tersely good
as professional rivals, become even more competitive once Ms. Jolie
sashays into view as the latter's show-stopping biker-chick wife.
Whatever possessed Ms. Blanchett to play Cusack's wife, a heavily
accented Long Island housewife who talks about casseroles in the
oven, she brings off the role with good humor and unexpected grace
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A WALK ON THE MOON,' starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev
Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn
(R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the
brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as
the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside
down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a
housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a
torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With
a tenderness that is unusual for a contemporary American film, it
tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected
Woodstock-era music. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest
blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for
the movie (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WINSLOW BOY,' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and
Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play, about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England, has been artfully pared down to
its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played
with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it
works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family
of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the
consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography
is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch
acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist
character a sharp edge (Maslin).

INFLUX OF CHINESE MIGRANTS COULD RUIN HONG KONG ECONOMY, OFFICIALS
WARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ With fears of an immigration crisis already at a
fever pitch here, the Hong Kong government warned Thursday that the
former British colony would be economically devastated by an influx
of well over 1 million newly eligible migrants from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   In a 17-page report, the government laid out a Malthusian vision
of Hong Kong in which a flood of people would swamp the schools and
welfare rolls, create double-digit unemployment and dwell in
squatters camps or on rooftops until the city built more than
530,000 new apartments.
</P>
<P>
   With its current population of 6.8 million, Hong Kong is already
one of the most densely packed cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Hong Kong cannot bear the burden of these
1.67 million people,'' the territory's chief executive, Tung
Chee-hwa, said in a rare appearance at the legislature here. ``The
consequences are unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Hong Kong had little choice but to ask the Chinese
government to intervene _ either by amending the territory's
constitution or by modifying a recent Hong Kong court ruling that
granted residency to children born on the mainland who have at
least one parent living in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy leaders said both proposals would erode Hong
Kong's autonomy. The court ruling in January was seen as a litmus
test of ``one country, two systems,'' the agreement under which
Hong Kong was supposed to be a semiautonomous region within China
with its own legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also said the government was manipulating public opinion
by putting out forecasts that were exaggerated and intended to
scare.
</P>
<P>
   The government's estimate that 1.6 million mainland Chinese
would be eligible for residency was five times its own previous
estimate. And Thursday's report depicted the migrants almost as an
invading army _ saying they would overcrowd classrooms and
hospitals, blight the environment and saddle the local government
with $91 billion in additional capital spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it sound like they are barbarians who would ruin Hong
Kong,'' said Lee Wing-tat, an outspoken pro-democracy politician.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, said:
``They don't want to implement the court ruling, so they are
drumming up hatred and fear-mongering. This brings out the worst in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials defended their forecast, saying the
estimate of migrants grew because the court extended residency to
illegitimate children with at least one Hong Kong parent. But they
acknowledged that the economic report did not account for the fact
that 20 percent of those surveyed said they had no plans to move to
Hong Kong, even if they had the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of 1.6 million is still a lot of people,'' said
Regina Ip, the secretary of security. ``We certainly did not cook
up or inflate the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without the dire forecasts, the government may have
little trouble rallying support for measures to stem the tide.
Although most Hong Kong people are descendants of refugees from the
mainland _ many of whom came when Britain welcomed anyone who made
it across the border _ the prospect of a fresh wave of mainlanders
stirs deeply ambivalent feelings here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong not to let them come at all,'' Shirley Leung, a
messenger, said as she hurried through a rain-spattered square
Thursday afternoon. ``But if they all come at once, I am worried
that the crime rate will go up. Or else there will be problems in
education, social welfare, and housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even opposition leaders like Mr. Lee concede that Hong Kong
would have trouble accommodating 1.6 million migrants, or about
one-quarter of its existing population. Faced with a choice, Mr.
Lee said he would prefer to have Beijing amend the constitution
than modify the court ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But amending the constitution would take at least a year, and
other legal experts said Hong Kong could not live with the
uncertainty for that long. On Thursday, consensus seemed to be
coalescing around a proposal by Albert Chen, dean of the law
faculty at the University of Hong Kong, in which the government
would seek a reinterpretation of the ruling followed by an
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Chinese government has steered clear of the debate.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji told Hong Kong's No. 2
official, Anson Chan, that he would prefer the territory to resolve
the issue on its own. Legal experts said China was loath to be seen
as meddling in Hong Kong's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute seemed to put Tung in an awkward spot as well.
Traditionally a champion of ties with the motherland, the chief
executive came under fire Thursday for Hong Kong's unremittingly
negative view of the mainland Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our compatriots,'' he said, somewhat haltingly. ``But
I am concerned that if they come to Hong Kong, they will meet up
with even worse treatment than they got in the mainland.''

 &HT;    INSURERS WARN DRUG BENEFITS WOULD RAISE 'MEDIGAP' COSTS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Including prescription drug coverage in Medicare,
or allowing states to require such coverage in supplemental
insurance policies, would dramatically raise the price of
``Medigap'' policies, the health insurance industry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 12 million of the 34 million seniors who receive
Medicare also purchase private policies that cover such expenses as
Medicare's deductibles and copayments.
</P>
<P>
   Providing prescription drug coverage through Medicare, which has
been proposed by key Democrats in both houses of Congress, would
raise these Medigap costs by $1,000 a year, according to a study by
the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA).
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill envisions Medicare paying 80 percent of drug
costs, with patients paying 20 percent in copayments after a $200
deductible. The cost of these copayments would cause premiums to
rise, the insurers said.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill, offered by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., the ranking
Democratic member of the Ways and Means health subcommittee, would
allow states to require that Medigap plans offer prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only three of the 10 major Medigap companies offer
prescription drug coverage. Requiring drug coverage in all Medigap
plans would increase costs by $1,700 a year, according to the HIAA
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mandating Medigap coverage for prescription drugs is a bad
idea whose time has not come and never will,'' said Chip Kahn, HIAA
president. ``It will sharply raise premiums and increase financial
pressure on seniors who depend upon Medigap to help pay their
health costs. ``
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, warned that the proposals to require drug
coverage could price supplemental insurance out of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be saying to (seniors) you have no choice except an
unaffordable product,'' Lehnhard said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Stark, who has spearheaded the legislation,
said his office had not seen the insurance industry's report and
would not comment immediately.

IT'S `MUMMY'S' DAY! LET ACTION SEASON BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The good news: It's not ``Allan Quartermain and the
Lost City of Gold.'' Of course, it's not ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark,'' either. But then what is?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' is a definite charge, if you're looking for
spectacle, rowdy adventure and supernatural horror all crammed into
a raucous two hours of high-testosterone special-effects
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   A remake of Boris Karlov's 1932 movie series in name only, ``The
Mummy'' reinterprets the curse and the adventurers who unwittingly
unleash it.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, the mummy is an ancient Egyptian priest, lying
undead beneath the sand for 3,000 years and waiting for some fool
to set him free so he can wreak havoc on the world.
</P>
<P>
   Glad to lend a hand is an American treasure hunter (Brendan
Fraser), a beautiful Egyptologist (Rachel Weisz) and a pack of
two-fisted, three-gunned adventurers looking for gold beneath the
sands of the lost City of the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   What they find is a flesh-eating, soul-sucking skeleton who is
invincible or relatively so. When the trepid rogues aren't chasing
the skeleton or running from it, they're fighting mysterious
guardians of the crypt, assorted plagues of Egypt, brain-chewing
bugs, a deadly army of the dead and various other creepy-crawly
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Sommers (``The Jungle Book'') has taken the
advanced ``Indiana Jones'' course and learned his lessons well. He
keeps the movie pumping with battles, both natural and
supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   But Sommers is no Steven Spielberg, or, rather, he wants to be
too much so that he copies nearly every Spielbergian move, which
gives ``TheMummy'' an easy predictability that undercuts the
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the fights are stirring in that
it's-summer-let's-have-some-action sense. Fraser (``George of the
Jungle'') makes a stalwart Harrison Ford substitute, able to
deliver a punch or a punch line with equal flair.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a much-needed comic element is the very funny Kevin
O'Connor (``Deep Rising'') as a cowardly but resilient weasel.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are often knockouts. But there are times
when the computer-generated effects look like computer-animated
effects.
</P>
<P>
   As a warm-up act for other summer spectaculars, ``The Mummy''
gets the season off to a racing start. At least it does for adults.
``The Mummy'' is far too violent and gruesome for young kids.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is rated PG-13, ``The Mummy'' contains more than
enough grisly death scenes to have earned an R. The lower, more
kid-friendly rating is another example of how the desire of studio
marketing departments to sell violent movies to kids overpowers the
duty of the rating board to offer parents honest guidance about
movie content. 3 stars. &QL;

AT THE MOVIES: `LOVE LETTER'; `EYES WIDE SHUT'; ROLES FOR LATINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Kate Capshaw still recalls her conversation with
Steven Spielberg, her husband, when he noticed a dozen copies of a
novel, ``The Love Letter,'' on a table in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must like this book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of bought it,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean `sort of?''' Spielberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of bought it to turn into a movie,'' said Ms. Capshaw,
who acquired the film rights to the book, by Cathleen Schine, for
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg was nonplussed. ``Do we get to read it?'' he asked,
referring to Dreamworks, the company Spielberg owns with Jeffrey
Katzenberg and David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Dreamworks movie,'' she said. ``This is really a
small movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg said, ``At least let us pass on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recalling the conversation the other day, Ms. Capshaw said:
`` If someone like Michelle Pfeiffer or Jessica Lange or Julia
Roberts had bought a book, that would be one thing. But that's not
what my career has offered me. I was a little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   After the conversation with her husband, Ms. Capshaw and her
producing partners, Midge Sanford and Sarah Pillsbury, gave the
novel to Dreamworks. The company quickly agreed to make the
romantic drama about a woman, played by Ms. Capshaw, and other
people in a small New England town who find an anonymous love
letter that alters their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens May 21, the only studio movie to open against
George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode I _The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Capshaw said it took awhile for the film to get started.
``First I had like 20 babies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple adopted a child and she gave birth to one before the
movie was made, raising the number of children they have to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while Spielberg directed ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Ms.
Capshaw worked on the screenplay with Maria Maggenti and hired a
Hong Kong director, Peter Chan, whose previous films included
``Comrades, Almost a Love Story'' and ``He's a Woman, She's a
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Spielberg's involvement was intimidating to the
director and other actors, Ms. Capshaw said her husband
deliberately avoided any interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he talked, it was only in a supportive way,'' she said.
``He only opened his mouth if he was asked a question. He's a very
good boy in that way. He knows who he is. But his passion for
filmmaking is so contagious. He loves being on movie sets. It's
exciting for him to be on the set of an $8 million movie, like
ours, or a $100 million movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Capshaw is worried about the competition with the new ``Star
Wars,'' which opens May 19, but she remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we're going up against them; we're so
different,'' she said. ``If `Star Wars' is like the big wedding,
we're like the flower girl, something delectable coming down the
aisle, but not the main event.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan, who is 36 and lives in Los Angeles, said he was surprised
that he was offered the movie, mostly because of its small-town
America setting; he grew up in Bangkok and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a pretty interesting choice to choose a
Chinese director for something so American,'' he said. ``But the
subtlety of the story was something that I related to and something
that was, as Kate said, very Chinese, too. It deals with people who
keep their feelings internal, people who can't talk to each other
and express what they really feel. The love letter helps everybody
come out of their shell and go for what they want in life. All
these feelings are universal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Capshaw, Chan sought to put the best light on the
box-office competition with ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are such a smaller movie, such a different movie,'' he
said. ``Maybe it's a blessing. Maybe people will actually want an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kubrick Odyssey
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, Todd Field, a mainstay in independent
films as an actor, writer and director, suddenly received a call
from Jan Harlan, a longtime associate of Stanley Kubrick's and
associate producer of the new Kubrick film, ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We've been looking for you,''' recalled Field. ``He
said, ` Kubrick is interested in having you play a role in his new
film,' and I said, `Uh. . . uh . . . uh . . .' I couldn't speak. He
asked me if I was available on a certain date. I had actually
committed to work on a television series with Ed Zwick and Marshall
Herskovitz. The first read-through was actually the next day. It
was a horrible nightmare. I said to Jan that I wasn't sure about
those dates. I said I'd call him back.''
</P>
<P>
   He hung up the telephone, he recalled, and then his wife, Serena
Rathbun, a writer, told him to call back immediately and say he
would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Field said: ``This was like the Dalai Lama arriving at your
doorstep. How can you say `No?' I called Ed and Marshall and told
them what happened. They couldn't have been nicer. They said, `Of
course you have to do it.' Then I called Jan back and said, `I
didn't know what I was thinking.'''
</P>
<P>
   Field is contractually forbidden to talk about his role in or
the details of the much-anticipated Kubrick film, a psychosexual
drama starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, which is scheduled to
open July 16. It is the last film by Kubrick, who died March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Field is best known for his roles in Nicole Holofcener's
``Walking and Talking'' and Victor Nunez's ``Ruby in Paradise.'' He
has also been a co-producer and had a starring role in ``Broken
Vessels,'' directed by Scott Ziehl, about ambulance drivers in Los
Angeles. That film will be released on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Field's role in ``Ruby in Paradise'' attracted Kubrick's
attention. Field said the prospect of working with the director of
such classic films as ``Dr. Strangelove'' and ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' left him intimidated. But, Field said, Kubrick was far
from intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put you at instant ease,'' Field said. ``You could have
been talking to your best friend's grandfather. He was really a
warm, funny, smart New Yorker. He was from the Bronx, and he still
had that New York accent. He liked talking about baseball. He was
up on all the latest. In a way it made me all the more nervous. In
the beginning I thought: `This is too good to be true. It can't
last.' But it did.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``After we did a bit of work together, Stanley
would do a wonderful thing. When he felt you got the scene, Stanley
would look you in the eye and smile and shake your hand and say,
`Congratulations.'''
</P>
<P>
   Field called the director ``the easiest person I ever worked
with.'' He added:
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of his technical prowess, for all the gear and
gadgets, he understood actors in extraordinary ways. We would sit
down and dissect the work. He wasn't afraid of actors. He almost
demanded that actors bring something to the table. Everyone's
thoughts and opinions were not only encouraged but listened to and
explored. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. By the end of
rehearsals, it was like being in a play. The work had a certain
grace and sophistication. I'll never forget working with him.''
</P>

   Unequal Opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every studio executive and talent agent in Hollywood
knows that Latino actors have a hard time finding work in studio
films and television series. But not this hard.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some well-known Latino actors like Jimmy
Smits, Salma Hayek, Jennifer Lopez and Edward James Olmos, a report
on Latino employment in Hollywood, sponsored by the Screen Actors
Guild, found that the number of Latino performers in films and
television is declining.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the percentage of roles going to
African-Americans and American Indians had declined since 1997, the
last time a report was made. The only positive shift, according to
the study, was a slight increase in representation of Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos, who constitute approximately 10.7 percent of the U.S.
population, continue to be the most underrepresented ethnic group
on prime-time television and in films,'' the report said. ``Their
appearance in films and TV is less than one-third of their real
proportion of the U.S. population.''
</P>
<P>
   Screen Actors Guild president Richard Masur said the findings
were extremely disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the 1990s,'' he said, ``the America portrayed in
films and on television was moving slowly but steadily toward the
reality of our American scene. This is the first time the Guild has
seen those numbers decline'' in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos were not the only group underrepresented, according to
the study. There were also the issues of sexism and ageism.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that two out of three performing jobs went to
those under 40. And men received 63 percent of all jobs in 1998,
while women received 37 percent. Masur said that underemployment of
women, minorities, older people and performers with disabilities
was endemic in the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These performers are simply not receiving the numbers of roles
they can and should be playing to accurately reflect American
life,'' he said.

A SPECIAL MOTHER'S DAY GIFT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Patience Auer of Sebastopol is getting a horse for Mother's Day.
It is not just any horse. Its name is Bruce and it used to belong
to her 28-year-old daughter who had a habit of adopting old race
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Patience's daughter, Nessie (short for Vanessa) Gack was killed
last January in San Diego in a freak accident involving a horse.
She had been having trouble with a bad knee from a skiing accident.
She was a tall, thin, loose-limbed woman, said her mother, and
every so often her knee would pop out. Sometimes she wore a brace,
but at Christmas she told her mother even with the brace her knee
was becoming unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   She'd put off having surgery for a variety of reasons, mainly
because she was finishing up work on her doctorate. Always ``a take
charge child,'' she was at age 28 ``happy, alive, energetic and
vital, at the peak of her being.''
</P>
<P>
   In January she was completing a double major in communications
and cognitive science at the University of California in San Diego,
focusing on how children learn in the world of computers. She had
sent off a chapter to be included in a book on the educational
potential of CD Roms.
</P>
<P>
   In her other world, she had three horses, all one-time race
horses, no longer moneymakers, that she was training to jump. She
also had a part-time job at a stable, teaching riding and training
other people's horses.
</P>
<P>
   That January day she was leading someone else's horse out of the
barn to tie up and put tack on when her knee suddenly buckled. She
wasn't wearing a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   From what her mother can put together, Nessie started to fall
and held onto the reins. The horse began swinging its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse freaked and his head hit Nessie's head.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that quick and lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Nessie suffered a massive brain injury, went into a coma and
died 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   There was a memorial at the time in San Diego but Patience
needed a few months before having one at home for Nessie's old high
school friends. Now she's planned a memorial for June 5, a picnic
in Sebastopol's Ragle Park where horses are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting her daughter's horse was not planned. It started as a
fantasy and eventually turned into the most natural thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the accident Nessie told her mother about
Bruce, named after a blind date that wasn't successful. She had
intended to turn him into a jumper but discovered he had a pin in
his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me that I should take him, that we would be perfect
for each other, because he's shy. She said he needed a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, as family and friends hoped for a miracle,
Patience had dreams. First she had a dream about a kitten that she
was trying to keep safe and hidden in a shoe box. A few days later
she dreamed she was in an old house and a lizard ran across the
floor. She bent down and put it in her pocket. When she went
outside, the lizard leaped out and turned back to look at her,
``letting me know it didn't want to be caught.'' Soon after, her
daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the mother's living room there's an altar with
a painting of a lake and sky with a large teardrop in the middle,
like a giant crystal. She explains, ``I asked how would I know
Vanessa is with me and I got this image of a tear drop in my mind's
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to it is a happy gathering of family photos _ Nessie with
her younger brother, clowning with high school and college friends,
smiling from the top of a horse at age 2. There's a pair of
stirrups.
</P>
<P>
   Now, will come a reminder named Bruce, boarded nearby so
Patience can begin to visit him regularly. The mother said she and
Bruce need to get to know each other.

TRAINING FORD'S LUXURY QUARTET TO SING IN 4-PART HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM DIEM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Until recently, Ford Motor Co.'s only prestige brand
was Lincoln, which for decades was No. 2 to Cadillac in the
American luxury market but was virtually unknown in much of the
world. But in March, with Ford having acquired a fourth luxury
marque, the company formed Premier Automotive Group as an umbrella
for Lincoln, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo. That group is selling
twice as many luxury cars as General Motors, and within five years
its divisions expect to add at least 250,000 sales, putting Ford on
par with the BMW Group and DaimlerChrysler, which produces
Mercedes-Benz automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   If its luxury sales increase as much as Ford anticipates, the
company's profits will rise by more than $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   As Ford's group vice president, Wolfgang Reitzle is in charge of
Premier Automotive Group. He is also chairman of Jaguar Cars of
Britain and Volvo Cars of Sweden, and he is responsible for
insuring that Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo and Aston Martin do not steal
customers from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Reitzle, the former No. 2 executive at BMW, was hired on March
19 when Premier Automotive Group was formed. One of the first
consequences was a decision to postpone by 12 to 18 months a plan
to import Lincolns to Europe this fall. Up to now, Europeans have
shown little appetite for American luxury cars; compared with
homegrown models, they have tended to handle more ponderously and
take up more space on cramped Old World streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give Wolfgang the opportunity to take a look at
it and decide, Is this the right way to go?'' said Nick Scheele,
the former Jaguar chairman who is now senior vice president for
marketing sales and service at Ford of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of premium cars have been strong, and Ford executives say
they think the growth will continue. According to Mavel SA, a
French consulting company, global production for Ford's luxury
brands in 1998 totaled 662,137, compared with 933,580 for
Mercedes-Benz, 911,897 for BMW and Rover, and 299,122 for GM's
premium brands, Cadillac and Saab.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the luxury market is where the money is. ``Profitability
has averaged 3.5 percent over the last four years in volume
segments,'' said Andrew Blair-Smith, an auto-industry stock analyst
with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ``But in the premium segment, for
Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, it has been 7 to 8 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Reitzle, 50, has two jobs: co-ordinating the marketing of each
brand and the product development for all four. On the marketing
side, ``one has to be very careful to keep the identity of each
brand,'' Walter Hasselkus, former chairman of the Rover Group _
which is owned by BMW _ said in a telephone interview from his home
in Munich, Germany. He endorsed the idea of the premier group.
``When you are in the mass manufacturing business, it is an
advantage to separate the premium brands from the mass brands,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheele insisted that each of the brands had a strong identity,
and that each had plans to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's cars, and its Navigator sport utility, have an
all-American aura. While the focus of the other marques is
European, the operations of Lincoln Mercury have been moved from
Michigan to California in an attempt to read the pulse of
car-conscious trend-setters on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   With Volvo and Jaguar well established internationally, Reitzle
may decide to keep Lincoln as an all-American luxury brand. GM's
strategy is to make Cadillac a global brand competing directly with
BMW and Mercedes. It is investing heavily in European racing, and
it is developing a rear-drive luxury car platform.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's reputation of concern for safety and the environment
sets it apart from Lincoln, Jaguar and Aston Martin. Volvo expects
to increase worldwide sales to 500,000 by 2002, from 400,000 now,
in part by snaring more Americans. Sales begin this summer in the
United States of compact S40 sedans and wagons built in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar's image is of sensuous, powerful elegance in the upper
luxury brackets. Last year, it sold 27,000 in North America out of
a production total of 50,000, and it intends to quadruple its sales
by 2002. To that end, it is bringing out smaller cars; the S-Type
goes on sale in the United States this spring, and an even smaller
car, with the code name X400, is due in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Aston Martin, the producer of luxury sports cars once known as
the choice of James Bond, stands by itself. It sold only 625 cars
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Reitzle ``will insure that the product plans themselves are
coherent and avoid duplication,'' said Joe Greenwell, a spokesman
for Jaguar here.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say they think Reitzle will seek common platforms
for cars from Volvo, Lincoln and Jaguar. The Jaguar S-Type and the
Lincoln LS already share their underpinnings, and the Jaguar X400
will use elements of the Ford Mondeo platform, which is also the
right size for the next Volvo 40-Series. But Scheele said potential
savings from common platforms must be balanced against the
potential risk of losing brand identity.
</P>
<P>
   It is more important to worry about factors that differentiate
the premium vehicles, like tuning their engines for distinctive
performance. For example, the S-Type and the LS share a 4-liter,
32-valve V8 engine. Each combustion chamber in the Jaguar is 1
millimeter deeper than in the Lincoln, so it produces 276
horsepower, compared with the Lincoln's 245. It also has more
torque, or acceleration power.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Reitzle was hired he introduced himself at Jaguar
headquarters in Coventry, England. Afterward he had a short holiday
in Florida, then began visits to Volvo in Sweden; Jaguar; Ford in
Dearborn, Mich., and Lincoln in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in an information-gathering mode and getting on with that
very fast,'' said Greenwell, the Jaguar spokesman. In Britain,
Reitzle studied business plans and visited the plants and
engineering centers of Jaguar and Aston Martin. This summer,
Reitzle will establish an office in central London with a staff of
fewer than 20 brand specialists and secretaries. He will juggle
time and travel schedules, since he will be in contact with offices
in four time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Reitzle is known in the industry as a car enthusiast, and he
owns a classic E-Type Jaguar. ``Reitzle is a coup _ he's a product
maniac,'' said Steve Haggerty, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co. in
London.
</P>
<P>
   A former colleague at BMW agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This premium car division suits Dr. Reitzle,'' Hasselkus said.
Reitzle and Hasselkus lost their jobs last winter, along with Bernd
Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, over the poor performance of the
Rover Group. While Land Rover's sport utilities have done well, the
group lost $1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As head of product development and heir apparent, Reitzle was
closely identified with BMW. At that German company's annual
financial press conference in March, shortly after Reitzle's
departure, Joachim Milberg, the new BMW chairman, said: ``We are
confident he will not harm BMW. I wish him the greatest possible
personal happiness and satisfaction in his working career.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania -- Three weeks ago, Vigan Budima was just
another young refugee, one of the thousands of anonymous faces seen
fleeing desperately from Kosovo. But in the days since, he has
become something else: the top Web page designer at Albania Online,
the biggest Internet company in the capital, his temporary
hometown. Budima, 18, arrived here with his parents after a
four-day journey through Montenegro with only packets of food and
the clothes on his back. He had no idea what had become of his
brother, Valon.
</P>
<P>
   So, as thousands of refugees waited in long lines for a
telephone, Budima knocked on the door of an Internet provider he
saw listed in the newspaper and asked if he could send his brother
an e-mail. Within hours, he had persuaded the owners of Albania
Online to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me. I don't have anything else to do,'' Budima
said, fiddling with a computer mouse and demonstrating his latest
designs from what has become his private office. ``Also, this is a
poor country. This Internet is new for them. There's not much
home-page development here.'' His good fortune is one extraordinary
story in a country where hundreds of thousands of Kosovars spend
their days in cramped refugee camps, and hundreds have no shelter
at all. But his ambition is strikingly common among his peers, many
of whom have sought jobs or volunteer work since arriving in
Albania in an effort to hold on to a fragment of normal life.
</P>
<P>
   In hotels and restaurants in Tirana, as well as in humanitarian
organizations in northern Albania, Kosovars are seeping into the
fabric of the country, with engineers working as English
translators and teachers working as office assistants. Some have
even managed to get jobs in their own field, like the doctors now
working with humanitarian health teams.
</P>
<P>
   Their motive clearly is not economic; few Albanian companies can
afford to pay refugees for work, and any wages are far below what
professionals earned in Kosovo. Instead, many refugees seemed to be
emerging from a state of shock into one of boredom, leaving them
anxious to re-create pieces of their former lives.
</P>
<P>
   They are frustrated by the length of time that has passed since
they left Kosovo. Although they hope to return home in a matter of
weeks, many say they are looking for things to do in the meantime
-- particularly if it means helping other refugees. ``You've got to
remember: These aren't peasants. Kosovo is not in the Stone Age,''
said Rick Grant, an official of CARE International. ``These are
educated, cultivated people, and it's natural for people who are
successful in their homelands to want to show some initiative, even
in this kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Grant said, ``Nothing is worse than to sit in a refugee
camp, day after day after day. It's like being in a penitentiary.
There's absolutely nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdet Nila can attest to that. After traveling into Albania
from his hometown of Pec, Nila, 35, said he spent a week in a
Tirana refugee camp, wandering all day between rows of tents. When
the owner of a nearby hotel offered to shelter Nila and his family
for a few days, he accepted, but only after insisting on
volunteering as a translator at the hotel's front desk. He soon
realized he was the only employee who could speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the owner, no pay is fine,'' said Nila, who ran a
family paint business in Kosovo and who now stays with his wife,
parents, and three children in room 42 of the Hotel Balkani. ``In
the camp, all the time I was saying, `I need work to spend my time.
I don't want to just walk around and smoke cigarettes.' `` Urban
Kosovars appear to be the most restless -- and the most useful to
Albanian and foreign companies -- because many worked at office
jobs in cities such as Pristina and Prizren and learned to speak
more than one European language. In that sense, they are more
employable than many Albanian natives, whose formal education
sometimes stops at the eighth grade. The sudden emergence of
refugees in the work force is a welcome sign to humanitarian
officials, who say it creates a kind of welfare-to-work atmosphere
in a system otherwise built on communist-era dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians ``obviously know the language, know the
culture, know the needs,'' said Rick Brennan, director of health
for the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based medical
team that has hired refugees in Macedonia and Albania. ``It allows
them to maintain their skills and their dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   At Albania Online, the symbols of Budima's gratitude are
emblazoned on his computer screen. He has created five home pages
in the past two weeks -- including ones for the Albanian Democratic
Party and for the country's largest radio station. He learned his
skills after school on an outdated computer in his parents' home.
But he was a pro even in high school: When his brother Valon, 27,
opened an Internet-provider firm in Pristina, Budima became a
long-distance employee, designing sites and communicating by modem
from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   His brother's company, Pro.net, shut down last month after the
NATO airstrikes began. Valon left a few days later. Budima and his
parents, both teachers, left their apartment March 28.
</P>
<P>
   After driving first to Montenegro, they decided to go on to
Albania, in the hopes that distant relatives might take them in.
When Budima got here, he thought that he might be able to reach
Valon by e-mail. ``I came here and asked if I can use the computer
for just half an hour,'' he said from the office of Albania Online.
``Then I showed them some home pages I'd done. They were
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out a deal: $30 per home page and access to the
Internet. But several days later, he got an even greater reward.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail came back from Valon. He said he had fled south from
Pristina toward Macedonia, spending six horrific days trapped near
the border before being allowed to enter a refugee camp. After
making it to safety, Valon had the same inspiration as his younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   He sought out an Internet cafe. And there, from hundreds of
miles away, he let his family know he had survived.

VAUGHN SAYS HE'LL BE ON BEST BEHAVIOR ON RETURN TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ He promises no death stares toward the owner's box, no
glaring at the general manager's suite. Mo Vaughn says there'll be
no gestures and no angry remarks directed at Red Sox management
when he comes home to Fenway Friday night wearing the uniform of
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not walking into Fenway Park to make a statement,'' Vaughn
said, sitting at his locker preparing to play at Tiger Stadium
earlier this week. ``I made my statement when I played there. I'm
not here to get up there and hit a home run and look up at Dan
Duquette's box or John Harrington. I'm not gonna do that. I've come
up big so many times I don't have to do that. I really want to get
this first one over and let it go and then just go play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Return of Mo. Citizens of Red Sox Nation circled this date
when the American League schedule came out last winter. But who
would have dared guess that Mo's comeback concert would feature
Pedro Martinez on the mound for the Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   New England sports fans have endured several of these painful
reunions in recent years. In July 1997, Roger Clemens came home and
struck out 16 Sox in a dramatic display of skill and acrimony.
Clemens eyeballed the executive suites when he came off the mound
in the eighth inning after fanning Mo with his last pitch of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   And who can forget the Returns of the Tuna? In 1997, Bill
Parcells's still-bumbling Jets took the heavily-favored Patriots
into overtime. In Tuna Bowl II last autumn, the Jets kicked butt in
Foxborough, effectively torpedoing the Patriots' season.
</P>
<P>
   Going back seven decades, there was the homecoming of beloved
Babe Ruth when the big galoot first returned to Fenway in a Yankee
uniform in 1920 (Those goofy New Yorkers had this silly notion that
Boston's former ace pitcher would better serve them as a full-time
outfielder). The Babe stayed at what is now Miles Standish Hall
(Boston University) when he made his return engagement and a
scorecard ad urged fans to smoke Babe Ruth cigars. The Globe's Mel
Webb wrote, ``The Sudbury farmer is a great favorite in Boston and
holiday crowds are likely to show him how much they regret his sale
to New York.'' The Sox held Ruth to two singles and a double in a
doubleheader sweep of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Mo. The Black Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says he's been watching the Sox struggles. He's pulling
for his friends on the team. But it's hard to miss the big hole in
the lineup. Boston's run production is way down and Sox fans are no
longer wearing ``Mo Who?'' sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to live with decisions that they made,'' said Mo.
``Whether they win or lose, they're still (expletive), so it
doesn't matter. Management's got to take heat. That means if they
have a long year, which makes it tougher on them _ and I don't want
that for them _ everybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows the Sox did not want Vaughn back. Despite an MVP
trophy and a six-season stretch in which he averaged 36 homers and
110 RBIs, Duquette and Harrington did everything possible to make
it appear they were courting Vaughn while sending larger messages
that he was not welcome back. When it all washed out in a downpour
of badwill, Mo had an $80 million contract and Duquette had
rejection letters from Bernie Williams, Albert Belle, Will Clark,
and Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mo returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about coming to Boston and this and that. I really
haven't thought about it that much,'' he says. ``I've been lucky
enough to move on. I've been lucky enough to understand my
situation a long time ago before the whole thing came down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no controversy anymore. It's not like I'm out here to
prove to the Boston Red Sox fans or media that I can play this
game. I'll be battling one of the best pitchers in baseball, no
doubt about it. Pedro, he'll come in. He'll establish the inside. I
probably won't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have gone through all the things I have gone through in the
past two or three years _ it's not as painful as people think
because it was expected. I don't know what it's going to be like in
terms of how the fans are gonna be, but I'll always miss the
intensity of Fenway Park, the intensity of the fans. I think that's
what gave me my focus. Now it's just a situation that is over with.
It's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things have not gone particularly well for Mo and the Anaheim
Angels. While Boston has struggled through its spring of
Bestseller-List-Meets-Disabled-List (Jimy Williams is the boy who
loved Tom Gordon), the Angels have encountered more of the bad luck
that marked their four decades of existence. They have the usual
raft of disabled players and struggling pitchers, but are fortunate
that no team in the AL West has bolted from the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's been painful for Mo. In the first inning of his first game,
he almost broke his left ankle when he plunged into the Cleveland
dugout in pursuit of an Omar Vizquel popup. In his subsequent
first-inning plate appearance, he fell in the batter's box when he
flied out to left field. By midgame, he was en route to the
hospital. Vaughn was on crutches when he conducted his first
postgame interview with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint on the disabled list due to a ``high ankle
sprain,'' Mo returned with a vengeance, hitting a monstrous SkyDome
home run in his first at-bat. He hit his fourth homer Wednesday
night in Detroit, and comes to Fenway batting .300 with 13 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to get back on the field. Mo is an active person. When
he was a kid, Shirley Vaughn would make little Mo run around the
block a few times before sending him to school. He had to do
something with all that energy. Now he loathes the gentleman-farmer
lifestyle of the major league designated hitter. The Angels finally
put him back at first base Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so much of a better player when I play defense,'' said
Vaughn. ``Jimy Williams wouldn't let me DH when I was hurt. He said
I was (expletive).
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle has been kind of tough, and I haven't been able to
do much, but that's the way it's got to be to get it right. This is
an injury where I never broke anything or had surgery or anything
like that, but it's probably the worst injury I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are from Boston, the Anaheim Angels really can't tell you
anything you don't already know about Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Terry Collins said, ``He's been everything you
expect. He's a true professional in the way he goes about things.
He prepares as good as anybody I've been around. This guy knows
what the game is about. He's willing to pay the price to win and
he's not afraid to tell others how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with a guy like him your whole lineup changes. And
he can hit anybody. Mo's got a big back.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels shorstop Gary DiSarcina, who's on the disabled list
because he was struck by coach George Hendrick's fungo bat while
standing around the cage, said, ``I knew a lot about who Mo was and
what he did in the community. But as a teammate, he's very
professional. He treats everybody the same _ the clubhouse kids,
players, coaches, the media. It's kind of surprising and
refreshing. Nowadays, you sometimes walk around on eggshells when
you are around superstars. Not with Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina lives on Cape Cod and watched the Vaughn saga unravel.
He thinks he knows what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you have insecure management and a superstar who
speaks his mind and says, `This ain't right,' of course you'll have
problems. Management's not going to want that guy around. Maybe
he's too vocal. He threatens their leadership. That's what it look
like to me. I think Red Sox fans could see how the relationship had
run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins concluded, ``Mo's everything we heard about. I'll give
(Angels GM) Billy (Bavasi) credit. He did his homework. This guy's
the real deal. And we've got a lot of people looking forward to
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mo remembers the return of Roger. It was a Fenway event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me because this guy had raised me in this
game in a lot of ways, and I never understood why he wasn't playing
for us. He hit me the first time up. I said, `Why'd you hit me?' He
said, `I just wasn't ready to pitch to you yet.' He struck me out
three times. I was the last one in the eighth inning. Ninety-seven
miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo's family will be at the game. He's commuting from his home in
Easton throughout the weekend. A friend will deliver him via limo,
and no, there won't be much time for the Foxy Lady.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's aware that there was some ``Mo Who?'' sentiment around
Fenway early in the season when the Sox were 5-1. There won't be
much of that in Boston Nomar Garciaparra has just one homer and the
Sox can't score enough runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be checking out their hacks from the side,'' said Vaughn.
``And I'm always gonna offer knowledge to guys. Those will always
be my guys. It'll be good to see Jimy Williams and the coaching
staff. They helped me out a lot. But really I just want to get on
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   What if he crosses paths with Duquette?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gonna say anything. I really don't have anything to
say to him. And I'm sure he doesn't have anything to say to me. If
I walked right in front of him, I wouldn't know what to say. I'd
probably say, `How you doing'?''
</P>
<P>
   And the honest answer would be, ``Not too well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are reeling. Perhaps they would be scuffling even
with Vaughn, but that won't soothe the fandom.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn isn't gloating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to have anything thrown up in their face to make
myself feel good,'' he said. ``It's not me against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like playing on the West Coast you get to see them on
TV a lot. They got some guys I don't know. I find myself talking to
the TV a lot. I'll always worry about them. I don't know what to
expect from them when negative times come along. I'll always just
hope that they're all right because it can get tough up there. It
can get very, very tough. They've just got to stay together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was able to take a lot of things off a lot of
people. I just don't want any of them to feel . . . what I learned
about this game more than anything over the last couple of years
that I played is that you can't be a one-man gang. Everybody's got
to help. Nomar's not going to win or lose games. He's just got to
do his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how you feel when things are going good.
It's how you react when things are going poorly. That's what I was
there for.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are going poorly. But Mo doesn't play ball for the Sox
anymore.

BRUINS ARE IN IT FOR REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The dust has settled. The fog has lifted. The Boston
Bruins, with all due apologies to Walter Zenga's improved
Revolution, are the only viable game in town.
</P>
<P>
   The town is ready to embrace them, and this is a town that knows
how to embrace a hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needs any reminder, it is here for us in the form of
Clark Booth's splendid book, ``Boston Bruins, Celebrating 75
Years,'' a labor of love for one of our true hockey mavens. Read a
few chapters and you'll be ready to put the pads on yourself.
</P>
<P>
   What would really be good is for the young players to devour
this book. Then they would know what their franchise heritage
really is, assuming Clark wouldn't lose them with a first page
reference in which he compares the Bruins to ``the Lancastrian
kings, whose recklessness was at the core of their charm and whose
excesses were invariably redeemed by valor.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can certainly think of more than a few Bruins whose
recklessness was the very essence of their charm (Terry O'Reilly,
for openers). We've had many players who displayed valor, and the
hope now is that the supply is being replenished in the form of
both the young stars in the making and the quality veterans who
have been leading by all kinds of example during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   You would certainly think that Tim Taylor has shown a few of the
younger lads what playoff grit is all about, and Dave Ellett makes
two. And any time the youngsters want to gaze at the definitive
personification of grit and valor they need only focus on No. 77,
who, in case you haven't been paying attention, has once again been
nominated for the Norris Trophy. Of course around here, that's a
bit like saying that if it's spring it must be time for the Pops.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of likable, downright effervescent
personalities among the younger players, but the one who seems to
have the best overall feel for being a Boston Bruin, in the Clark
Booth sense, is Anson Carter. I'm not saying the others aren't
having a good time, but he realizes the full possibilities of being
a hockey player in what remains a hockey town.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the matter of the Game 6 crowd (You can throw
in Game 4, too). ``You'd better believe a crowd like that helps
us,'' he says. ``They were in full voice even before the game
started. The ceiling was shaking. Ray Bourque said it best: `It was
like being in the Old Garden.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been a Bruin since March 1, 1997, and he was starting
to wonder if he had been dropped off in the wrong rink by mistake.
Quite frankly, this wasn't the Bruins' experience he had been
hearing about. ``I was looking forward to playing in the city of
Boston and for a franchise with a history like the Bruins,'' he
explains. ``I grew up in Toronto, so I know what the Original Six
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't hearing a 23-year-old rhapsodize about the ``Original
Six'' make those little hairs on the back of your next snap to
attention?
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter knew about the ``Big, Bad Bruins,'' I am sure. He
had heard Boston was a great place to be a hockey player. But he
never got to play in the Garden, and in the first two-plus years he
skated in the Fleet there was no special aura. He was beginning to
wonder if he would ever experience even a small portion of the
excitement that has greeted storied Bruins teams of the past.
</P>
<P>
   As much as people, myself included, romanticized the Garden, the
Bruins' buzz was not just about the Garden. It was about the team,
and about performance, and about playing the kind of hockey that
sells in this town. People here need to feel that, if only they
were good enough, they could skate a shift and be welcomed as one
of the gang. They want teams that hit, teams that don't back down.
They want a decent goaltender. After all, this is the franchise
that has had as its last line of resistance the likes of Tiny
Thompson, Frankie Brimsek, Terry Sawchuk, and Gerry Cheevers. Even
Jacques Plante passed through the Garden portals, turning in a
memorable shutout in his Boston debut. They've got the goaltender,
unless a Vezina Trophy candidate isn't good enough for someone.
</P>
<P>
   They've also got the kind of credibility an impressive Stanley
Cup series victory can bring. And the Carolina triumph was
impressive. The Bruins won a smooth Game 4 behind a raucous home
crowd, extricated themselves from a 2-0 two-period deficit before
winning on Mr. Carter's goal in the second OT in Game 5, and closed
out the series with a shutout conquest in Game 6, backed by a crowd
that, as Carter notes, bore the valued Ray Bourque imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   The next step may or may not be too big for this group, but the
intriguing thing is that no one truly knows. The Bruins are in the
Eastern Conference championship mix, the town is alive, and the
players are thriving in the invigorating atmosphere. We can say
with assurance that they will not be easily deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could it be more exciting?'' reasons Jason Allison. ``It's
Stanley Cup time. The adrenalin is pumping. Especially in this
conference, anyone left has a chance. Any team can win it. There's
not one of the four left you can look at and say, `That team can't
win it.' That includes us.''
</P>
<P>
   These Bruins can in no manner whatsoever be compared to their
elders. This isn't the Shore team or the Kraut Line team or the Orr
team. But, without doubt, something is stirring here. In reference
to the 1970 champs, Clark Booth maintains that ``the frozen ponds
of the National Hockey League composed their Agincourt.'' Give this
bunch a few more years and Mr. Booth might have to rack his
historical brain anew for a suitable salutation.

   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Bonn, Germany) _ The West and Russia agreed for
the first time Thursday on the need for an international military
presence in Kosovo to keep any eventual peace, but the composition
of such a force and conditions for its deployment remained in
dispute. An agreement reached by foreign ministers from the Group
of Seven and Russia marked a decisive step away from the specter of
a wider conflict over the Balkans between Washington and Moscow. It
also intensified pressure on Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, by demonstrating that Russia is not ready to turn its
back on the West to support him. By Roger Cohen.

   KOSOVO-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis on the Kosovo plan,

where this NATO-Russian agreement leaves Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president. By Jane Perlez.

</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-BUSH (Washington) House Republican leaders are so united
in their support for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for their party's
presidential nomination that they have already begun meeting
informally to discuss a common agenda for Bush and House candidates
in the 2000 election. These meetings are the latest demonstration
of how much of the party appartus _ including the entire House
leadership _ has concluded that Bush's nomination is inevitable. By

</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER-SPENDING (Undated) _ American consumers are on a
rampage, increasing their spending even faster than they did last
year. Retail analysts and economists point to numerous factors,
including the continued rise of both the stock market and home
values, to explain much of the gains. But another change is also
helping: While the wealthiest consumers powered the expansion in
its early stages, spending by those in the bottom 40 percent of
income, defined as households making up to $28,500 a year, has been
picking up. By Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T-MICROSOFT (Undated) _ AT&AMP;T and Microsoft have confirmed
plans for Microsoft to buy $5 billion of AT&AMP;T preferred shares in
exchange for nonexclusive rights on settop software. Microsoft will
also buy MediaOne's 29.9 percent stake in Telewest, Britain's

OPEN MINDS, NEW IDEAS NEEDED IN THE WAKE OF HIGH SCHOOL MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Littleton, Colo., the dead have been buried, the
memorial services have been held, the tears have been shed, and the
students who survived the massacre at Columbine High have begun
classes in another school.
</P>
<P>
   Pain and heartache continue to grip the pleasant community at
the foot of the Rocky Mountains as residents try to reconstruct
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the post-mortems continue to demonstrate that
a terrible tragedy like the one that exploded at Columbine High
School often reinforces human biases instead of opening minds and
changing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to judgment, advocates of gun control demanded
stricter controls. Critics of current American values and political
leadership urged a renewal of old values and a change in leaders.
Those who cite the violence in movies, television, computer games
and rap lyrics wanted stricter control of such entertainment.
People who attribute the disaster in part to the absence of prayer
in public schools called for its return. Those who fault today's
family life demanded a revival of the ways of earlier eras, which
may or may not have been better.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. Some of the demands are valid; others are not.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of broadening people's views, disasters like
Littleton and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing often reinforce the
views they already hold.
</P>
<P>
   There is a huge market in America for smut, violence and
pornography. Not only do people pay money to witness this trash on
the big screen and the small screen, but critics often praise it
because they say violence and a graphic depiction of the sordid
side of life give provide ``realism.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be all right for adults. But it can be dangerous for
impressionable young people, especially those who have mental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   We now know that Eric Harris, one of the young men responsible
for the carnage at Columbine High, was highly disturbed _ filled
with hate, a love of war and a compulsion to kill. He could see in
movies and on TV and the Internet and could find in gun shops the
weapons to reinforce his hallucinations and his plans to spread
mayhem throughout his school, his community and even his country.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of tighter gun control point out that Harris and his
colleague, Dylan Klebold, made their own bombs, as did Timothy
McVeigh who killed 168 people in Oklahoma City. That is true. But
Harris and Klebold also obtained guns that they used to murder 12
fellow students and one teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Convening a National Rifle Association meeting in Denver shortly
after the tragedy in nearby Littleton, NRA President Charlton
Heston suggested callously that the organization had been made a
scapegoat for the Columbine massacre simply because one was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Brady law that requires law enforcement officers
to check the backgrounds of would-be gun buyers appears to have
reduced the number of new gun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But obviously more needs to be done. Guns appear to have been
obtained surrepticiously for Harris and Klebold by friends who were
old enough to buy them legally.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting seriously a ban on guns used by hunters or
target shooters. But Congress, which often has acted like an
adjunct of the NRA, can and should do more to make it difficult for
potential murderers and thieves to obtain guns.
</P>
<P>
   Family values cannot be dictated by government. They must be
taught in the home. That means parents should become more involved
in the lives of their youngsters and should more carefully assess
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   It also could be helpful if teachers were required to instruct
their students in how to treat others. Many youngsters grow to
adulthood without ever learning good manners or proper etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment probably prevents government-decreed
censorship of motion pictures, television, computer games and rap
lyrics. But government leaders, from the president on down, and
private organizations dedicated to ethical and religious principles
can use their power of persuasion to achieve change.
</P>
<P>
   As for prayer, many of us believe it should be taught in the
home and the house of worship rather than in publicly funded
schools. It also is questionable whether prayer in public schools
could pass Constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   But the teachings of the various religions certainly could be
part of the curriculum a youngster learns in his or her formative
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many actions can be taken at the national and the local
level to try to avert disasters similar to the one at Columbine
High. It is possible that it might not have happened if Harris and
Klebold had not been treated as outcasts by other students.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot revert to the Victorian age or to the 1950s. But we
can open our minds to the problems we face and seek ways to help
our young people and steer them away from such tragedy.

POPE IN FIRST VISIT TO ORTHODOX ROMANIA IN 1000 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bold and risky move to bridge a schism that has lasted
nearly 1,000 years, Pope John Paul II travels to Romania Friday for
the first papal visit to a majority Orthodox Christian nation since
the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox split in 1054.
</P>
<P>
   The historic trip is the most significant effort in recent
memory to try to reconcile the divisions between the two churches
that occurred nearly a millennium ago over bitter arguments about
papal authority.
</P>
<P>
   For John Paul, who has made improving relations between the
Roman Catholic Church and other faiths a hallmark of his
pontificate, his 86th pilgrimmage outside Italy is a major gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on John Paul's words and how they are interpreted by
the world's 223 million Orthodox, the visit could either help bring
the two churches closer or could simply harden existing feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely critical trip from both churches'
perspective,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a papal analyst and
editor of America, a Jesuit magazine. ``The pope has had a policy
in which he would not go to an Orthodox country unless he was
invited by the Orthodox Church. He certainly doesn't want to do
anything to cause an ecumenical incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The division of Chrisitianity into eastern and western churches
revolved around theological issues, especially the Orthodox refusal
to recognize the pope as the head of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   While most Orthodox recognize the Ecumenical Patriarch who sits
in Constantinople as the spiritual leader of their faith, Orthodox
churches are divided into more than a dozen autonomous and largely
ethnic branches.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond long-running theological disputes, in recent years the
two churches have quarreled over church property and proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War thousands of Catholic churches in the Soviet
Union and Soviet bloc countries were confiscated and taken over by
Orthodox Christians. And since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the Orthodox have accused Catholics of trying to convert Orthodox
in former Communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbles between Orthodox and Catholics have sometimes
turned violent. Last year in Romania, for instance, Greek Catholics
got into a shoving match with an Orthodox congregation that had
been evicted from a Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a fight that has lasted 1,000 years and
that's not something that is going to be easy to overcome,'' noted
Juliane Cooper, a history professor at the University of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of John Paul's three-day visit to Romania and a
major ecumenical event is expected to occur on Sunday when the pope
and Romanian Orthodox Patriarch Teoctist are scheduled to attend
each other's liturgies.
</P>
<P>
   Arranging a papal visit to an Orthodox land was an arduous task.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul was eager to travel to Russia, the country with the
world's largest Orthodox population, but the Orthodox Church there
has refused to invite him.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican then turned to Romania, where 80 percent of the 22
million people are Orthodox and whose Orthodox Church is second to
Russia's in numbers and importance.
</P>
<P>
   But it took months of delicate negotiations before the Romanian
Orthodox Church would accede to a papal visit. One key Vatican
concession is the pope's agreement not to visit Transylvania or
Moldovia, two regions with large concentrations of Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian Orthodox Church feared that the pope's presence in
those two areas would stir up tensions between the Orthodox and the
Catholics. The Russian Orthodox Church has warned that the pope's
visit could easily exacerbate tensions between the Orthodox and
Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul also will have to be cautious in how he addresses the
war in Yugoslavia, which the Vatican has tried to bring to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   While Romania, which borders Yugoslavia, has allowed NATO to use
its air space, the Romanian Orthodox Church supports their fellow
Orthodox Serbs in their claims to sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, meanwhile, has been vocal in its condemnation of
ethnic cleansing of Muslim Kosovars by armed Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   But John Paul, more than any other pope in recent memory, has
repeatedly expressed deep respect and fondness for the Orthodox.
``He feels that the well of spirituality runs very deeply in the
east, more so than in the west,'' said the Reverend Richard
McBrien, a professor of theology at Notre Dame University.
</P>
<P>
   And, Reese added, John Paul has ``always believed that the best
ecumenical opportunity for the Catholic Church is with the Orthodox
because our theology is so similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoing divisions that have lasted for centuries will require
``small incremental steps,'' said Thomas Groome, a theology
professor at Boston College. ``This trip is a small step and might
very well be remembered in the future as a big moment.''

CLINTON PROMISES REFUGEES THEY WILL GO BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGELHEIM, Germany _ Meeting for the first time with the human
beings whose plight is behind the biggest military gamble of his
presidency, President Clinton Thursday told more than 300 ethnic
Albanian refugees that they would return to their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under overcast skies in a clean but cheerless refugee camp in
the rural Rhineland, Clinton spoke to a group of traumatized people
who were, like him, serious and somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will go home again, in safety and in freedom,'' Clinton
said. He gave them no time frame, and they responded with polite
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared moved during more informal meetings, first with
one family, and then with two dozen refugees who were flown to the
German camp April 9 after fleeing into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees told variations of the same theme: how they were
rousted from their homes by Serb paramilitary police who threatened
them with death unless they boarded trains in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, for Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   A teenage boy broke down, telling Clinton, ``I cannot talk about
Kosovo.'' Clinton, moved by the boy's distress, later comforted
him. White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the refugees
reassured Clinton that the war against Yugoslavia was justified and
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured the refugee camp with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder before flying to Bonn for a meeting with the German
leader. Schroeder told the refugees that their plight had
strengthened the resolve of NATO to see through its bombing
campaign until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic gives in to
NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the camp, a former youth offender facility where the
refugees live in clean, spartan dormitory rooms with bunk beds,
Clinton sat and listened to the story of Sabit Salihu and his
family. Salihu, 60, said that his grandson, Blendan, was born March
24, the day NATO began bombing, but that four days later masked
Serb forces ordered them to leave or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My home was burned. We were beaten. Everything was stolen from
us,'' Salihu told Clinton, speaking through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Salihu said that during their trek out of Kosovo, his three
daughters smeared their faces with mud to make themselves
unattractive after learning that Serb troops had been raping
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Salihu's 25-year-old nephew, Rexhap, said Serb troops taunted
them as they fled, saying, ``If you want NATO and Clinton, go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's eyes were moist as he listened.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the glare of the president, other refugees were
cautious when asked if NATO needed to do more. None of them blamed
NATO's bombing for hastening their expulsions, saying Milosevic was
determined to drive them out of Kosovo anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But Beckim Ademi, 25, a truck driver, urged NATO to send in
ground troops to finish off the paramilitary forces hiding in
civilian homes in Kosovo. ``They need to go in now, to help the
people stuck inside Kosovo,'' said Ademi.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees here are the few lucky ones. They all survived days
in an open field in Blace, a border crossing in northern Macedonia,
and were picked at random to be flown out to Germany. Many families
said they had been separated in the confusion as Macedonian
authorities bundled them onto buses.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the camp, Clinton urged the assembled group of
refugees not to become bitter. He told them he was of Irish
heritage and quoted the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who in his
poem ``Easter 1916,'' about violent nationalism, observed, ``Too
long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you . . . not to let your hearts turn to stone,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the refugees politely applauded and Clinton shook hands
as the public address system bizarrely and inexplicably played a
cheery accordion version of ``Red River Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   But away from the president, refugees were saying they cannot be
anything but bitter. Ekrem Lapashtica, 24, said he ran a video
store before the Serbs forced him out. Now he wants to join the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the only way we get our rights back,'' he said.

BASIC VIRTUES LIFT TINY METRO  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, MAY 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cheap wheels, basic transportation. Whatever you call
it, the Chevrolet Metro is as minimalistic as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as Suzuki Swift, the Metro is best regarded as an
urban vehicle, a commuter or grocery-getter that is cheap to buy,
cheap to own and cheap to operate. It's there to get the job done,
but it also provides some sporty small-car enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   And the gas mileage is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could take one of these on a road trip, but its
diminutive dimensions and small engine might turn your pleasure
tour into a grueling trek, threatened by looming semis and bogged
down on uphill climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Metros are sold in the shorter, two-door
configuration, our tester was a marginally larger four-door. Both
models are built on the same 93-inch wheelbase, but the sedan's
rear bodywork makes it 15 inches longer.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the sedan comes only with the bigger four-cylinder.
Bigger, of course, is relative. This is a 1.3-liter unit, which is
big when compared with the coupe's standard 1-liter, three-cylinder
base engine.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, three cylinders. This little mill is a gas-mileage
champ, rated by the EPA at 41 mpg city and 47 mpg highway. Now that
gas prices have been climbing precipitously, that could be a major
consideration. But only just, because at 55 horsepower this buzzing
little critter barely can get out of its own way. I'd say that if
you're going for the coupe, pony up the extra cash for the
four-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   With the four-cylinder, the sedan had enough power to keep up
with traffic, and turned in decent gas mileage. Performance is not
exactly sprightly, but winding out the little engine does achieve a
reasonable amount of zip.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who wonder, yes, my 6{-foot frame does tuck in
behind the wheel of the Metro. But barely. Most drivers and
front-seat passengers should find enough room up front, though
back-seat passengers larger than child-size might feel challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the interior is reasonably comfortable and
well-finished, with straightforward gauges and controls.
</P>
<P>
   The $13,000 test Metro came with a decent array of features,
including central locking (windows were manual) at $220; a
rear-window defogger for $160; a $125 package of remote trunk
release, split folding rear seat, dual manual remote mirrors and a
trunk light; and a $1,665 package that included power steering, an
upgraded stereo (still pretty lame) and air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-lock braking system was $565 extra, surprising because
Chevrolet was a pioneer in offering this important safety feature
as standard equipment on even its most inexpensive vehicles, such
as Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Metro was sold by Chevy dealers as a Geo Metro,
along with the Geo Prism, but both are now Chevrolets.
</P>
<P>
   The four-door's styling is generic Japanese, but fit and finish
are pretty good for such an inexpensive car. Both the coupe and the
four-door Metros were restyled and re-engineered a few years back,
improving their driveability and changing the boxy, utilitarian
style of the earlier models.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I find the shorter coupe version of the Metro to be
more interesting to look at and more fun to drive. It's just a
basic little hatchback, but it handles well and feels sporty. I
definitely could see having one as a second car for tooling around
town, or as a fun little ride for a young driver.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with competitive budget craft from Korea, made by
Hyundai and Kia, the Suzuki offerings seem sturdier and better
engineered. But the more-mainstream competition, such as the
lower-end models of Honda Civic, Ford Escort, Nissan Sentra and
Dodge/Chrysler Neon, may cost a bit more comparably equipped but
offer better, more-competent vehicles with fewer compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chevrolet's own Cavalier is close in price but offers more
car for the money. The Metro and Swift, by the way, are built in a
Suzuki/General Motors joint-venture plant in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who want a little car at a budget price with a
reputation for durability, the Metro's not a bad choice. For a
young driver seeking a fun ride or someone who wants only basic
transportation, the price tag is a definite incentive. &QL;

THE DEVIL IS IN THE _ MANY _ DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 44 days of NATO bombing and 44 days of Yugoslav defiance,
a plan to end the Kosovo conflict is finally taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement issued Thursday by the United States, Russia,
and other members of the Group of Eight nations meeting in Bonn,
Germany, is a big step forward, say diplomatic analysts. But the
devil _ a brigade of devils _ will be in the details.
</P>
<P>
   What the Group of Eight (which also includes Britain, France,
Italy, Germany, Canada, and Japan) achieved was to bring Russia
over to the NATO position that Serb forces must leave Kosovo and
that an international security force must be allowed to enter to
protect refugees as they return.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the statement was hazy, however, when it comes
to the type of international force that would go in and other
crucial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is positive. Bringing Russia in as a real participant is
an important accomplishment. But the parties will now have to come
to the table to talk about specifics, and that will be a very long
process,'' said Jeswald Salacuse, a professor of international
negotiation and conflict resolution at Tufts University's Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest problem: Before the bombing stops, Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic will have to accept the G-8 plan, at least in
principle. As of Thursday ight, he had not. So NATO air raids
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a bombing halt until Milosevic makes a credible
withdrawal from Kosovo, said Peter Galbraith, former US ambassador
to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing he'd like better than a bombing halt and a
permanent period of negotiations,'' said Galbraith. ``At that point
there would be no punishment for him, and he would be much more
firmly in control of Kosovo than before the war began. That is a
trap that NATO has to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Milosevic accepts the G-8 plan or any other, Yugoslav
officials have made clear, key points of contention _ especially
the matter of what kind of international force will be deployed to
Kosovo _ will have to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of the G-8 plan was vague on this point, mentioning
``deployment in Kosovo of effective international civil and
security presences'' but not specifying what countries would make
up the force or how it would be armed.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the force must
have ``NATO at its core'' and include American and British troops.
Milosevic has long objected to this. He wants a lightly armed force
without NATO involvement. Russia says Milosevic's acceptance of the
type and strength of the force is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less, for Milosevic, would be a loss _ and could
threaten his survival as Serb leader. But without overwhelming NATO
military strength inside Kosovo, the alliance will not be able to
intimidate local combatants or deter revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of uniforms alone does not a military operation
make,'' said William Nash, a former major general who commanded US
Army troops in the 1995 Bosnia deployment. ``In Bosnia, having a
robust force with great capacity was crucial. We were in charge. We
eliminated the opportunity for ongoing violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash acknowledges that in Bosnia all of the sides had stopped
fighting and that the cease-fire had held for two months before the
NATO force went in.
</P>
<P>
   Composition of the force is only one of the military questions,
said Roger Fisher, director of the Harvard Negotiation Project and
long active in international conflict resolution. Among other tough
issues, he said, will be how to verify Serb forces have pulled out
of Kosovo, how to schedule the transition of control, and how to
settle disputes that will arise on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be big questions involving the return of ethnic
Albanians to Kosovo, many of whom have been stripped of their
identity papers, and how to get humanitarian aid into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally will come the biggest question of all: the future of
Kosovo. The Serbs rejected the Rambouillet plan for Kosovo that was
drafted before the conflict began. Almost certainly, they would not
accept it now, even after being pounded by NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all these substantive items, how do you take this plan
forward so that it gives Milosevic and his people a sense that they
are participating in this?'' asked Fisher, who said what is needed
now is a neutral party, such as United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan, to mediate between Belgrade and the 19-member NATO
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be easy either, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a situation where you have a committee on one side
and a liar on the other,'' said Fisher. ``How in the hell does
Milosevic give credible assurances that he is complying?''

FOR RUSSIANS, STILL MANY PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The West could claim success by agreeing with Russia
Thursday on general principles for ending the war in Yugoslavia.
But there is no joy in Moscow over the deal.
</P>
<P>
   From the Western perspective, getting Moscow to back a strategy
that calls for an international peacekeeping force to replace Serb
troops in Kosovo puts added pressure on Moscow's ally, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, to agree to NATO's terms for peace.
</P>
<P>
   And an agreement on even general terms for peace relieves the
enormous tensions that have built up between the world's largest
nuclear powers, Russia and the United States, over Moscow's angry
opposition to NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   But from Moscow's perspective, the results of Thursday's meeting
of the foreign ministers of Russia and the seven leading industrial
nations accomplished little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing is continuing, the destruction is even greater,
and as before people are leaving Kosovo,'' said Russia's Balkans
envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov expressed open
disappointment that NATO had refused his proposal to halt the
bombing to allow peace talks with Belgrade. Ivanov also said such
any peacekeeping force could not include NATO troops, as demanded
by the alliance, without Belgrade's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To secure Russia's approval, Thursday's agreement left out any
mention of NATO, saying instead that the troops would be approved
by the United Nations. Russia wants the troops to be under UN
command, a position NATO has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has also proposed that the United States and Britain,
which have led the bombing of Yugoslavia, be excluded from any
Kosovo peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright, who met with Ivanov Thursday, flatly ruled out such a
plan as ``not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright instead underscored that Thursday's agreement meant
that Russia now accepts all of NATO principles for a solution: an
end to violence in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serb forces from the
southern Serbian province, the return of Kosovo refugees, the
introduction of an international security force and a political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the difference has not been over Russia's support of
these principles, but over Russia's insistence that the bombing
stop before a settlement is reached, and differences over the
makeup and auspices of the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is an understanding,'' Ivanov told reporters
Thursday, ``That a political solution is necessary and a military
victory is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The subtle differences in the way both sides saw Thursday's
events are indicative in the broad differences between Russian and
Western assessments of the Balkans conflict. In the West, the past
two weeks of Russian diplomacy have been widely interpreted as a
sign that Moscow had abandoned its earlier, more confrontational
reaction to the war and was now ``on board.'' Among the perceived
reasons for this change were that Moscow realized it had more to
gain by avoiding a complete break with the West.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the change in Russian attitudes, and Chernomyrdin's
appointment, occured only in the Kremlin, and mainly as a result of
President Boris N. Yeltsin's need to reassert himself and sideline
his prime minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, who had pursued the
tougher line. Many Russians, and much of the country's political
elite, have questioned whether Chernomyrdin's peace missions serve
the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, Moscow is acting for NATO's benefit, and suffering
moral and political losses,'' commented Sergei Karaganov, head of
the Council on Foreign Defense Policy, an influential think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moscow politicians still express concern that any
escalation of NATO's campaign could drag Russia into the conflict
on Serbia's side. Yeltsin has said he would not allow this to
happen, and has so far resisted calls by parliament to send arms to
the Serbs. But Yeltsin has also ordered improvements in Russia's
nuclear arsenal, at a time when some Russian military brass and
lawmakers advocate using the threat of Russia's nuclear arsenal to
force NATO to halt its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has played down the potential for the Balkans conflict to
escalate into a game of nuclear brinksmanship, mainly because few
Western policymakers believe Russia would resort to such drastic
measures. But some analysts say this view is shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that there's a danger that in the NATO policy there
may be a misestimation of Russian reaction that resembles what is
clearly a misestimation of Milosevic,'' said Graham Allison,
director of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International
Affairs, who recently traveled to Moscow and held talks with
leading politicians such as Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov and others say Moscow would not be able to stand by if
NATO fought a ground war in Yugoslavia, something no one here has
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about World War III,'' said Alexei Arbatov, a
member of a politically moderate faction in the lower house of
parliament. ``Not because our government and our president will
declare a war on NATO, but because the pressure on them to send
volunteers and weapons will become unbearable and they may give up.
The West should understand and realize this...If that happens,
things like credits and bankruptcy and defaults will not matter.''

<P>
   Given the structure of the school year and the rhythms of the
business world, summer travel is often family travel. Visits to
museums, historic sites and restaurants must be leavened with
diversions for children, and a family at the beach needs backup
when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, destinations are complying. Museums are adding
areas for toddlers or emphasizing yucky stuff kids like, bugs and
rats among them. Sea life entertainment centers are adding rides
and theme restaurants staffed with actors and entertainers.
Historic centers are catering to smaller visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even amusement parks realize that not all children want to
experience several G-forces on a roller coaster, so they are
enlisting employees to wear cartoon-character costumes and wander
around areas that contain gentler rides.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of child-oriented attractions that visitors
would not have seen last summer:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAKING A SPLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Sea World parks, long known for dancing dolphins
and leaping whales, have been adding attractions of a more
mechanized sort. The park in San Diego opens its first adventure
ride May 29, though it is one that doesn't leave the water. It is
called Shipwreck Rapids, and the premise is that riders are island
castaways in an inner tube (actually a nine-passenger raft) trying
to navigate a rough river that will return them to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   On the trip, the passengers bounce through rapids, and in case
they are not wet enough, pass under dripping cargo nets and leaky
buckets left by wrecked ships and narrowly miss a partly submerged
ship's propeller. They will see live turtles and crabs and actors
in the role of castaways along the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The raft enters a dark tunnel and the hissing engine room of a
ship before ending the trip at the foot of a restaurant called the
Shipwreck Reef Cafe. There, diners can view live flamingos, ibises,
sea turtles and occasionally penguins, sea lions or otters.
</P>
<P>
   Sea World California, 500 Sea World Drive, San Diego, (619)
226-3901, is generally open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but 9 a.m. to 10
p.m. starting on June 12; open later on weekends. Admission is $38;
$29 for children 3 to 11, $35 for 55 years and older. Parking costs
$6; www.seaworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   BRANSON: There are steel coasters and wood ones. May 16, in
Branson, Mo., Silver Dollar City, a turn-of-the-century-theme park
in the Ozarks, is adding Buzz Saw Falls, a ``liquid'' coaster.
</P>
<P>
   This ride takes visitors in a free-floating boat that plunges
down a flume at up to 51 miles an hour and then becomes a regular
mechanical coaster that is pulled up a track before making a final
six-and-a-half-story drop.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Dollar City, on West Highway 76, Branson, Mo., (800)
952-6626, is open daily in summer 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission:
$31.20, $20.50 for ages 4 to 11 and $29.10 for 55 and older;
www.silverdollarcity.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILD THINGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: In a world of animatronic T. Rexes and 12-story
upside-down triple-spiral roller coasters, a four-inch-long animal
that looks like a hot dog with buck teeth and a tail may seem like
an unlikely attraction for children. But naked mole rats, native to
Africa, have been drawing crowds at a number of zoos around the
country, and now the children's section of the St. Louis Zoo is
home to 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
   They live in six large transparent cylinders connected by clear
tunnels, something like an ant farm. In fact, the animals have a
social system much like that of ants, with a breeding queen and a
few breeding males. The others, male and female, are workers and
soldiers. The naked mole rats have eyes that don't see, but their
noses and ears work well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very popular because they're repulsive,'' said Alice
Seyfried, supervisor of the children's zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The children's zoo also has new shows featuring otters and birds
and the main zoo expects to open a ``river's edge'' exhibit,
featuring Asian elephants.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Zoo, Forest Park, St. Louis, (314) 781-0900, is
open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (till dusk on Tuesday between Memorial
Day and Labor Day). Admission is free. The children's zoo is free
from 9 to 10 a.m. and $3 thereafter; children 2 and younger are
always free. Web site: www.stlzoo.org.

   THE BRONX: Visits to New York often include a performance of
``The Lion King,'' with its stylized African setting, at least for
those who get tickets months ahead. Families can step into another
re-creation of Africa beginning June 24 at the Bronx Zoo, in the
Congo Gorilla Forest.
</P>
<P>
   A trail about a half-mile-long will take visitors through a
6.5-acre tract of central African rain forest, past colobus
monkeys, okapi, mandrills, guenons and red river hogs. The shady
forest will include more than 20,000 plants of 400 species, with
rocky outcrops, streams, wading pools and thickets of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   The trail leads to a 37,000-square-foot building with smaller
African rain forest animals, like fish, snakes and mice. After a
seven-minute film about gorillas, the screen will rise to reveal a
large window through which a troop of gorillas will be visible.
Visitors then move on to other sites _ indoors and out _ to see
these and other gorillas _ there are about 20 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Also inside will be 21 interactive learning bays, in which, for
example, a human can call up a thermal image that illustrates how a
heat-sensing snake ``sees'' him. An area devoted to rain forest
conservation, built around an artificial rain forest tree with a
wedge cut out by a chain saw, will teach about deforestation,
overpopulation and other threats, and allow visitors to donate
their admission fees to the preservation of gorillas, elephants,
mandrills or okapi.
</P>
<P>
   On eight consecutive weekends beginning June 26 (including
Monday, July 5), Celebration Congo, free with zoo admission, will
feature African music and dance, stilt walkers and face painters.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Zoo, Fordham Road and Bronx River Parkway, Bronx,
N.Y., (718) 367-1010, is open weekdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekends
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is $7.75, $4 for ages 2 to 12 and 65
and older. Wednesday admission is free, with a donation suggested.
Admission to Congo Gorilla Forest will be $3; www.bronxzoo.com.

<P>
   SEATTLE: When the weather doesn't cooperate, a museum can make
for diverting and even educational shelter, if it knows how to
engage children. In this city known for rainy days, the Pacific
Science Center offers 4,000 square feet at a steady 80 degrees
(though a bit humid at 80 percent) and an average of 6,000
foot-candles of light; on a typical cloudy Seattle day, about 1,800
foot-candles reach the ground at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Those bright, warm conditions are in the new Tropical Butterfly
House, and are perfect for butterflies, around 1,000 of which
flutter freely there. Pupae are brought in, from, say, Costa Rica,
and blue morphos butterflies emerge, or gold-banded foresters from
Kenya hatch as visitors watch through a window to the Emerging
Room. Since each butterfly lives little more than two weeks,
species are rotated.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, bugs are a big attraction at the museum's new Insect
Village. There is an insect zoo, where visitors can see 10 types of
insects, like hissing cockroaches, giant centipedes and hairy
tarantulas, and six types of arthropods (not the same thing, one
learns) and can touch some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Insecta Sideshow is a ``tent'' that tells, through
interactive displays, of fleas that can jump 200 times their
length, of ants that can lift more than 50 times their weight and
of beetles that hunt underwater. A Wall of Fame illustrates the
smallest (a wasp one two-hundredth of an inch long), the heaviest
(a quarter-pound beetle), the longest (a 22-inch walking stick) and
the loudest (an African cicada as loud as a jackhammer) insects.
The museum also has an IMAX Theater, which can show 3-D movies.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Science Center, 200 Second Avenue North, Seattle, (206)
443-2001, is open weekdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
weekends and all summer. Admission is $7.50, $5.50 for ages 3 to 13
and 65 and older. IMAX and laser shows are $4.50 and up;

Y2K HOTELS (Phoenix) - Father time wears a Rolex this New Year's
Eve and free-spending partiers might wake up in the new millennium
with a Dom Perignon-like hangover. Four nights at the MGM Grand and
Barbra singing `The Way We Were` (Before We Were Broke) at a Jan.
31 show is $8,500. The Phoenician's seven-night package is $6,600
per couple. The Arizona Biltmore is bringing in the Righteous Bros.
and the Temptations on back to back nights in a package that ranges
from $7,000 to $15,000. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCHOOL-THREAT (Prescott Valley, Ariz.) - Two 8th-graders in a
Prescott Valley charter school have been arrested for allegedly
telling authorities they'd been planning to shoot teachers and
students in their school. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALBERTO RIOS-BOOK (Phoenix) - Bilingualism has served writer
Alberto Rios well, teaching him that everything has more than one
name. Critics have said he writes in Spanish that looks like
English: English words, Spanish syntax. The emotion is uniquely
Rios. Though primarily known as a poet, Rios has just published a
new collection of short stories, ``The Curtain of Trees,'' which
draws from his heritage in a Mexican-American family of
storytellers. By BARBARA YOST. Story moved in the ``E'' category &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Before the massacre at Columbine High
School in Colorado, 14-year-old Tim Murphy turned in a fictional
story, a fairy tale, for a class at Pioneer Elementary School in
Glendale. Tim's story was titled, ``The Wicked Teacher.'' Not long
after turning in the assignment, Tim received a 10-day suspension
for `'written statements that threaten the safety of school
staff.'' That's what we do in America. We ignore problems until
it's too late, then respond in a way that's completely out of
proportion. It'll happen soon in schools across the land. By E.J.
MONTINI. Story moved in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.
</P>

   &QL; 
MUMMY-MOVIE (Phoenix) - The good news: It's not ``Allan Quartermain
and the Lost City of Gold.'' Of course, it's not ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' either. But then what is? ``The Mummy'' is a definite
charge, if you're looking for spectacle, rowdy adventure and
supernatural horror all crammed into a raucous two hours of
high-testosterone special-effects filmmaking. By BOB FENSTER. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - Cheap wheels, basic transportation.
Whatever you call it, the Chevrolet Metro is as minimalistic as
they come. Also known as Suzuki Swift, the Metro is best regarded
as an urban vehicle, a commuter or grocery-getter that is cheap to
buy, cheap to own and cheap to operate. It's there to get the job
done, but it also provides some sporty small-car enjoyment. And the
gas mileage is excellent. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L''
category. Embargoed for Saturday, May 8. &QL;

   BRANSON: A whole new amusement park, Branson USA Entertainment
Park, opens Friday. Set on 50 acres, the park will have about 20
rides, including a six-story steel coaster from Belgium, the
Firestorm, and a 10-story Ferris wheel from Italy that offers
riders in 26 gondolas views of Branson and the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Future stock car racers will be able to ride on two elevated
go-cart tracks ($5) and there will be food and 20 shops selling
mainly souvenirs and toys. There will be six rides for the very
young.
</P>
<P>
   Branson USA Entertainment Park, Highways 376 and 76, Branson,
Mo., (417) 335-2396, is to open daily 11 a.m. to midnight.
Admission is free; an all-day pass for rides costs $15.95, $7.95
for ages 4 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER: Familiar cartoon characters, particularly ones with
prominent ears, have some history as a device for attracting
children to parks. The dozen Six Flags parks have enlisted Bugs
Bunny, along with other Looney Tunes characters.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Six Flags Elitch Gardens has redone its children's
play area, called it Looney Tunes Movie Town and put in 10 rides
for children under 54 inches tall. Among them are Pounce and
Bounce, in which children seated in a cylinder are pulled about 20
feet to the top of a tower and dropped, a carousel called Around
the World in 80 Seconds and Marvin the Martian's Reel Spin.
</P>
<P>
   A play area called the Looney Tunes Acme Prop Warehouse, for
children 54 inches or shorter, will mainly feature foam balls that
can be thrown or shot with an air cannon, plus slides. A musical
show, ``What's Up, Rock?'' will feature Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck,
Sylvester, the Tasmanian Devil and other characters performing
'50s-style songs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Batman Forever Thrill Spectacular is a stunt show
in which the Caped Crusader, Robin and the Riddler fall from
heights, fly and flip on motorcycles amid explosions and fireballs.
And those too tall for the Acme Prop Warehouse, that is over 54
inches, can get full-size thrills on the area's fourth roller
coaster, the Boomerang, which sends riders down a 125-foot drop and
through three loops before they reverse the trip, facing backward.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags Elitch Gardens, 299 Walnut Street, Denver, (303)
595-4386, is open 5 to 10 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday
and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday till Memorial Day, then 10 to 10 daily
June 4 to Aug. 30. Admission is $28, $14 for children shorter than
48 inches and $16 for those 55 to 69; www.sixflags.com.
</P>
<P>
   PIGEON FORGE: Dollywood, Dolly Parton's entertainment and
amusement park in Tennessee, has put in a new roller coaster. The
park celebrates the culture and music of the Great Smoky Mountains,
and the Tennessee Tornado provides riders views of the Smokies from
above, on a 137-foot climb, and from within, through a dark tunnel.
The coaster emerges and takes riders on a series of 360-degree
loops at 63 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The park has also opened the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame
and Museum, tracing gospel music from the 19th century to today.
</P>
<P>
   Dollywood, (800) 365-5996, is in Pigeon Forge, 35 miles
southeast of Knoxville, and is open April through December. The
hours vary, but on most summer days they are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
One-day admission is $29.99, $20.99 ages 4 to 11 and $24.99 for 60
years and older, plus tax; www.dollywood.com.

   ORLANDO: The Titanic and its fate may have seemed fusty until
the movie of a couple of years ago captured the imagination of the
public and the hearts of Leonardo-smitten teen-agers. A new
attraction in the Mercado shopping and entertainment complex in
Orlando, Fla., Titanic _ Ship of Dreams, houses pieces of both the
real and cinematic versions.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors start at a ``dock'' with a 40-foot section of a ship's
side as the sounds of horse hooves, a foghorn and shouts of people
seeing off passengers are broadcast. Inside, they walk through
re-creations of rooms in the Titanic, including the grand staircase
and more than 200 artifacts from the ship, including a deck chair
(predictable joke here), letters on ship stationery, a life jacket
and first-class china.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the movie memorabilia: a costume worn by Leonardo
DiCaprio among them. Staff members in period costume play the role
of passengers and tell stories about the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic _ Ship of Dreams, 8445 International Drive, Orlando,
Fla., (407) 248-1166, is open daily 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Admission is
$14.95, $9.95 for ages 6 to 11; www.titanicshipofdreams.com.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Aquariums are associated with sights of the sea, but the
New England Aquarium in Boston is directing attention to its
sounds. A new exhibit, ``Sounds of the Sea,'' hums, clicks, rumbles
and roars with the crack and creak of an iceberg, the odd clang of
a walrus and the snap of shrimp, among other noises that fish hear
(they do have ears).
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes three chambers that broadcast the calls of
migrating humpback whales and the natural and man-made _ from
sources like boats and oil _ sounds they hear in the Atlantic.
Sound ``dictionaries'' translate the noises.
</P>
<P>
   At interactive stations, visitors can impersonate a dolphin
bouncing sounds off the ocean floor or hear how an operatic tenor
singing underwater would sound a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds of the Sea'' is in the Exploration Center next to the
main exhibition building of the New England Aquarium, Central
Wharf, Boston, (617) 973-5200. From July 1 to Labor Day, the
aquarium opens daily at 9 a.m. and closes Monday, Tuesday and
Friday at 6 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. and weekends at
7 p.m. The rest of the year, it is open weekdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and weekends 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $12, $6 for ages 3 to 11 and $10 ages 60 and older;

   &UR; IT'S SHOW TIME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG: Long an attraction for adults and older children
keen on learning about Colonial America, Colonial Williamsburg has
been making efforts to engage younger visitors. The latest is
children's theater.
</P>
<P>
   The show, to be held Wednesday nights this summer, is ``Bill and
Betsey's Pirate Adventure,'' aimed at ages 5 to 12. In it, three
20th-century children arrive in Colonial Williamsburg to meet their
grandmother. They fall asleep and dream about joining forces with
life-size versions of Bill, Betsey, Farrah and Hotch Potch, the
official dolls of Colonial Williamsburg, to find Granny Epps. It
seems she is being held by pirates who have fled custody and stolen
cookies from a bakery as they fled.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Granny gives the pirates her recipe for gingerbread
cookies, they become honest bakers in old Virginia and she is
released. Songs are sung, children get to parade across the stage,
and they have absorbed some details about 18th-century life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and Betsey's Pirate Adventure'' will be performed
Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in Hennage Auditorium in the DeWitt Wallace
Gallery from July 7 to Sept. 1. Admission is $10.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Williamsburg, Post Office Box 1776, Williamsburg, (800)
447-8679, is open daily 9 A.M to 5 p.m. One-day admission is $27,
which does not provide parking ($6) or entry to the museums or
Governor's Palace, and $16 ages 6 to 12. A Patriot's Pass, $35, $20
for children, provides admission for a year, including parking and
admission to other sites, plus $2 off tickets to the play;

   SANDUSKY: Too often, parents have a choice between
stomach-dropping thrill rides that would scare their children and
kiddie rides that leave the parents on the sideline waving weakly
each time the little car comes around. But parks are beginning to
install what they call family rides, big enough for grown-ups and
children to ride together but tame enough to leave their stomachs
where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Point, a 364-acre park on a peninsula in Lake Erie in
Sandusky, Ohio, has 67 rides, including 13 coasters _ steel, wood,
stand-up, all-dark, suspended _ and a 300-foot free-fall ride. This
season, Cedar Point is opening a family section called Camp Snoopy.
It will feature Peanuts characters (Charlie Brown, Lucy, Sally,
Schroeder and, of course, Snoopy) wandering around and appearing in
musical shows.
</P>
<P>
   The area has six family rides (and one just for kids), including
cars on a track, a ``camp bus'' on a big arm that goes around, up
and down, and a 38-foot-high roller coaster called the Woodstock
Express.
</P>
<P>
   Also new this year: an expansion to the Hotel Breakers on the
grounds, a '50s-theme diner and a ``stock-kart'' raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Point, 1 Cedar Point Drive, Sandusky, Ohio, (419)
627-2350, is open daily today to Sept. 6, plus Sept. 12, 18, 19,
24, 25 and 26 and Oct. 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10. Hours: 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. weekdays most of May and to 10 p.m. weekends, and 10 a.m. to
10 or 11 p.m. or midnight most of June, July and August.
</P>
<P>
   One-day admission is $32.95 (lower after Labor Day), $27.95 for
those 48 to 54 inches tall, $8.95 for ages 4 and older under 48
inches tall; www.cedarpoint.com.
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO: With the swirl of activity at Walt Disney World, a
circus there would seem redundant. Yet Disney World does indeed
have an outpost of the Cirque du Soleil, in the Downtown Disney
entertainment and shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute production is ``La Nouba'' (from the French
``faire la Nouba'' meaning ``to party'' or ``live it up'') and it
features more than 60 gymnasts, acrobats, dancers and clowns. The
central idea is a clash between the monochromatic Urbains and the
colorful Cirques, performed in the French Canadian company's
distinctive dreamlike and highly theatrical style.
</P>
<P>
   In the Animal Kingdom, the animal park that opened last year, a
whole new continent _ Asia _ has opened, with real animals in
manufactured scenes. One attraction is a ride on the Kali River
Rapids through rain forest (including a burning logged-out area)
and by temple ruins and waterfalls. Another is the Maharajah Jungle
Trek, a walk that includes sights of gibbons on a Nepalese-style
tower and ruins of a Thai temple, tigers at a maharajah's palace,
giant fruit bats by cliffs, a komodo dragon and a variety of birds.
And the Flights of Wonder show, at the Caravan Stage outdoor
amphitheater, has been revamped with a new story line and new
birds, including macaws and ibis.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Kingdom section has added Buzz Lightyear's Space
Ranger Spin to Tomorrowland. This ride is essentially a shooting
gallery: Visitors join Buzz (the ``to infinity and beyond''
character in ``Toy Story'') in a quest to keep the sinister Emperor
Zurg from stealing all his fellow toys' batteries to fuel his own
weapon of destruction. On their space cruisers, equipped with twin
laser guns and a joy stick that spins the craft, children blast
orange Emperor Zurg insignias and battle giant robots.
</P>
<P>
   At Epcot, the one-mile Test Track enables visitors to drive
indoors through cold and hot conditions and outdoors up to 65 miles
an hour. Drivers can go up hills and take their cars through skids
and a 50-degree banked curve.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Doug Live'' stage show has been inaugurated at the
Disney-MGM Studios park. Doug is the animated character of a
children's TV show muddling through his middle school years. And
near the entrance to the Blizzard Beach water park, is a new
36-hole miniature golf course, half the holes in summer sand and
half in winter ``snow.''
</P>
<P>
   General information on Walt Disney World is available at (407)
824-4321. Hours vary for the various parks but in summer, the
Animal Kingdom is usually open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., the Magic Kingdom
9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Disney-MGM, 9 a.m. till 7 to 10 p.m.
Admission to any one park is $42, plus tax, $34 for ages 3 to 9;
there is a variety of multipark and multiday passes.
</P>
<P>
   La Nouba tickets, which are $56.50 and $45.20 for ages 3 to 9,
plus tax, can be reserved at (407) 939-7600. Performances take
place Wednesday to Saturday at 5:30 and 8:30 p.m. and Sunday at
2:30 and 5:30 p.m.; www.disneyworld.com.

   LEG07 _ A 6-year-old Wichita, Kan., girl will undergo a rare
surgery Friday at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas
City. Cancer has destroyed the thigh bone in one of her legs.
Doctors will remove the cancerous part of her bone, amputate the
rest of her leg, turn it around 180 degrees and attach the
remaining thighbone to her hip. Her knee joint becomes her hip
joint, her ankle becomes her knee and she'll have a prosthetic
lower leg. And the doctor says she'll be able to play football and
wrestle, two sports she's really interested in. The little girl
also will be considered cancer-free once the surgery is done. By
Alan Bavley. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

   BANK06 _ An 18-year-old high school girl thought she was doing a
favor for a couple of friends by driving them to a recruiting
station Thursday. Along they way they stopped at a Gladstone bank.
One guy got back in the car and said drive _ fast. She did, only to
discover he'd just robbed the bank. She saw a cop, pulled over, and

THE GOP ON PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps the Kentucky Derby's crowded 19-horse field
will be an inspiration. The thunder of 76 hooves made for the most
exciting race in many years, and a dark horse took the roses,
paying off very well on long odds.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months from the first primary, the Republican presidential
field is similarly jammed with panting runners. Twelve announced,
semi-announced or thinking-about-announcing GOP candidates are
poised at the political gate to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first presidential election since 1944 in which the
Republican pack has not been dominated by an incumbent president, a
towering World War II hero or a seemingly invincible single
frontrunner. The temptation to run has been irresistible for a host
of candidates without much going for them.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this mob scene a handful of stars will gradually emerge.
A few months on the road will eliminate those who cannot get
nationwide attention, raise dizzyingly large sums of money or stay
out of political trouble. In New Hampshire last Sunday, the state
Republican Party tried to jump-start the 2000 show by gathering
eight candidates to present abbreviated versions of their case for
themselves and raise a little money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the biggest GOP names did not show _ Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and conservative television
commentator Patrick Buchanan. The biggest name who did appear,
Elizabeth Dole, stole the evening with sensible, tolerant positions
on gun control and abortion that defied heavy-handed party
orthodoxy and represented a clever effort to reach beyond the GOP
right wing. For her independence, she was booed.
</P>
<P>
   Question: When is it good for a presidential candidate to be
booed in the first primary state? Answer: When the state is
irrationally pro-gun and the candidate is a well known but
electorally untested woman who needs to demonstrate that she can be
tough.
</P>
<P>
   Bush naturally dominated the field just by not being there, but
then he's never anywhere but Texas, at least until next month. His
so-called yellow rose garden strategy cannot go on forever, despite
his healthy lead in the Republican polls. Voters are rallying
behind the family name. They don't know the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hiding behind his local duties, he'd better let them
know how he thinks and what he's like soon. He who sits on hot
political lead can get bottom burned.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is creating a vacuum that allows others to get noticed. He
leads Dole, his nearest challenger, by 2 to 1 in most polls. But
she is moving now and should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain, who got family-friendly points by staying away from
New Hampshire to celebrate his son's 13th birthday, is steadily
rising in the polls in response to his hawkish stand toward the
Serbian assault on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He was supported for president by 14 percent of local GOP voters
surveyed in a New Hampshire TV station poll last week, double his
previous numbers. That's not stratospheric, but he is breaking out
of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates most identified with one or more key
issues often do better than those who have a reputation for a mushy
general philosophy. McCain will now forever be the foreign policy
hawk in the race. Dole will be the gun control diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing baron Steve Forbes, known for his radical flat-tax
proposal when he ran four years ago, is trying to broaden his
appeal by talking about other issues and modifying the flat-tax
nonsense. He has merely lost his focus. What makes Forbes stand out
now? Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is a publicity sideshow, always good for an outrageous
quote but no longer fresh, as he was in 1996. Furthermore, this
time his isolationism is not just nuts but positively dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine anyone but their mothers seeing the
others as serious presidential material. This is a lot of
``formers'' in search of current employment. These guys need to get
a life.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle is still a joke. His prompt
reaffirmation of the wisdom of the National Rifle Association's
resistance to modest gun control measures confirms that he hasn't
learned a thing since he left office seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's former Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander,
whose major national qualification for the White House is a Cabinet
post that he thinks is of so little importance that he told
Congress to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   And there's former anti-abortion lobbyist Gary Bauer, who vowed
to ``devote every waking hour of my presidency'' to outlawing that
legal procedure. This means he would be asleep when problems of
Social Security, Medicare, Kosovo, the economy, education, crime
and national security hit his White House desk. Hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Rep. John Kasich, young and stingy, thinks that cutting
federal budgets for public services that voters need and want will
win him votes. Dream on, tightwad.
</P>
<P>
   Why talk show host Alan Keyes and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith
are in this beats me. It will beat the voters too.
</P>
<P>
   And last but maybe not least, there's New York Gov. George
Pataki, who is making the standard preliminary moves of a potential
presidential candidate, short of actually committing himself. The
locals say he's really after the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   We've all been complaining that the primary season is
front-loaded and short and will be essentially over by mid-March of
next year. Maybe that's not such a bad idea after all. The sooner
the field is thinned out, the better.

BELATED BRAGGING RIGHTS FOR LINCOLN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FORD-LUXURY) 
(mk) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the battle for first place in luxury vehicle sales heated up
last year, Ford Motor Co. insisted that winning was not its goal
for Lincoln. Rather, its priorities were building the brand,
entering new segments of the market and attracting younger buyers.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like an excuse from a company that feared it would
lose the race once again. Indeed, when the numbers were in, General
Motors' Cadillac Division seemed to win by a nose, thanks to an
unlikely come-from-behind selling blitz in December.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Lincoln emerged victorious. In an embarrassing
about-face, Cadillac conceded that it had ``overstated'' its 1998
sales by some 4,773 cars and trucks. That gave Lincoln the luxury
sales title for the first time in 57 years.
</P>
<P>
   After Cadillac's embarrassed announcement, Lincoln continued to
take the high road, praising its rival's integrity in admitting the
error and continuing to sing the same tune about its mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position remains unchanged with our focus on growing the
relevance of the Lincoln brand,'' Mark Hutchins, general manager of
Lincoln Mercury, said in a statement. He said Lincoln was focusing
on the introduction of the rear-drive LS sedan and distinctive new
vehicles like the Blackwood, which combines the cabin of a
Navigator sport utility with a pickup bed paneled in rare wood.
</P>
<P>
   And for 1999, the luxury sales race is shaping up differently.
At the end of the first quarter, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus were
beating both Lincoln and Cadillac.

 &HT;    I hope prequel reignites magic of 22 years ago
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a lot of young boys in the late 1970s, I was a
big ``Star Wars'' fan. Actually, I was a fan even before the movie
was released on May 25, 1977, before any of us had an inkling of
the movie's seismic power, before I was bonking my brother on the
head with my plastic Eveready light saber.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, my journalist father had received a
Twentieth Century Fox press kit, which included a lobby card and a
sheaf of glossy 8-by-10s showing various ``Star Wars'' characters.
He gave it to me. Unsure what the movie was all about (space? the
desert?) and humming with questions (``Mom, what's a Wookiee?''), I
was nevertheless enthralled. I stuck the pictures on my wall.
Chewbacca was my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the movie, of course, amplified my ardor for ``Star
Wars,'' exponentially. I acquired ``Star Wars'' toys, trading
cards, sheets, the soundtrack, even the disco mix of John Williams'
theme song by Meco. The Force wasn't with me; it owned me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' monopolized my imagination for a healthy spell.
Its appeal was clear: the simplistic, archetypal narrative, so
rigidly Manichaean (a word I wouldn't learn to love until I was at
least 11); the whiz-bang effects; the crisp lines and bone-white
surfaces of the space ships; the androids, Tusken Raiders, Jawas on
down. And, yes, Wookiees.
</P>
<P>
   For little boys, the film was a triumph of visceral fulfillment,
with only the most elemental emotional cargo to weigh on our tiny
chests. It was light, digestible and furnished a semblance of
resonance, of something lasting and vital. A semblance because by
the time ``The Empire Strikes Back'' came around, in 1980, my
enthusiasm for ``Star Wars'' was receding. By ``Return of the
Jedi,'' in 1983, it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   You know why I bring all this up. On May 19, almost 22 years to
the day since George Lucas unveiled ``Star Wars,'' the film's first
of three planned prequels, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' will open. We're all aware of the clangorous pre-hype. We
know the drill.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this, I'm in New York for Fox's official ``Phantom
Menace'' press preview. I see the movie Saturday. I'm not telling
``Star Wars'' zealots _ the bedraggled souls outside the cineplex
in lawn chairs surrounded by Taco Bell wrappers _ this information
to taunt them or incite envy. That would require partiality on my
part, the presumption that I felt one way or another about seeing
``Phantom Menace'' and that I could empathize with those who are
already in line or who waited six hours at the mall to purchase a
plastic Jar Jar Binks.
</P>
<P>
   I don't and I can't. Save for a twinge of anticipation, I have
no investment in the movie. If Lucas decided to pull it and scotch
all prequel plans, my reporter side might quicken, but my
movie-loving side would not stir. My oath as a critic: I will
approach the movie as I do any movie, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I want to like, nay, love ``Phantom Menace.'' I wish
every movie I saw was my favorite movie. I hope it's wildly
entertaining. I hope it dazzles, thrills and makes me laugh. I hope
I feel what I did 22 years ago. I hope by next week I'll be
energetically playing with my new Jar Jar figurine.

 &HT;    Independents move online as fall books debut
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Independent booksellers are heading into uncharted
territory at a time when book publishers seem bound to
tried-and-true formulas.
</P>
<P>
   At Book Expo last weekend, the same annual conference where
publishers traditionally introduce their fall lists, independent
booksellers were banding together to form Book Sense, a presence on
the Internet to keep their business from slipping away to companies
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second Harry Potter book (``Harry Potter and the Chamber
of Secrets'') is not in the stores yet,'' said Barbara Thomas,
past-president of the American Booksellers Association and current
president of its board, ``but so many people are buying it off the
Internet that by the time it gets to our stores, many of the people
who want it will already have it.'' Thomas, owner of Toad Hall
Children's Bookstore in Austin, sees Book Sense as a good
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Though no single hot new book emerged at Book Expo, certain
trends surfaced for this fall. Once again, publishers mostly sought
a sure thing _ adventure books, appraisals of the century,
celebrity heroes, political figures, TV tie-ins and authors with
recognizable names like Frank McCourt, Michael Crichton, Mary
Gordon, Walter Moseley, Sue Grafton, Patrick O'Brian and Thomas
Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure sells
</P>
<P>
   Following the runaway success of Jon Krakauer's ``Into Thin
Air,'' about climbing Mount Everest, and Gary Kinder's best-selling
``Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,'' about diving for treasure,
several publishers provided new nonfiction escapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Life and Adventures of John Nicol, Mariner,'' edited by
Tim Flannery (Atlantic Monthly Press, October) tells the true story
of a Scottish-born sailor in the 18th century who sailed around the
world twice, battled pirates, traded with Native Americans, fought
in two revolutions and fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Whitaker: A Life on the Edge, Memoirs of Everest and
Beyond'' (Mountaineers Press, September) and ``Himalaya: Life on
the Edge of the World'' by David Zurick and P.P. Karan (Johns
Hopkins Press, November) take you beyond Krakauer's ill-fated
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin provides a more leisurely, philosophical escape
in ``River Horse: A Voyage Across America'' (October) by William
Least-Heat Moon, author of the best-selling ``Blue Highways.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writer Pam Houston (``Cowboys are my Weakness'')
describes her real-life adventures in ``A Little More About Me,''
which ranges from Bhutan to Bolivia to a valley in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Century books
</P>
<P>
   Every publisher seems to mark the turn of the century. ``The
American Century: Art and Culture, 1950-2 000'' by Lisa Phillips
(Norton, October) is the second volume from the Whitney Museum of
Art. Or there's ``The Century of Sex: Playboy's History of the
Sexual Revolution, 1900-1999'' by James R. Petersen (Grove,
October) and edited by Hugh Hefner. Yale has ``American Chronicle''
by Lois Gordon and Alan Gordon (November); the University of
California Press has UCLA film Professor Peter Wollen's
``Addressing the Century: 100 Years of Art and Fashion''
(September).
</P>
<P>
   In ``The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story,'' journalist
Michael Lewis searches out the man he feels most embodies the
spirit of the coming technological age (Norton, October).
</P>
<P>
   Stars and more stars
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity heroes from sports include biographies of Joe Dimaggio
by Richard Ben Cramer (Simon &AMP; Schuster, September) and Jack
Dempsey by Roger Kahn (Harcourt, Brace, October), author of ``The
Boys of Summer.'' Pulitzer Prize-winning writer David Maraniss has
``When Pride Still Mattered: The Life and Myth of Vince Lombardi''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, October).
</P>
<P>
   Books on political figures range from Gail Sheehy's ``Hillary's
Choice'' (Random House, September) to George Bush's letters
(Scribner, October).
</P>
<P>
   Television tie-ins look promising. ``Julia and Jacques Cooking
at Home'' (Knopf, September) offers recipes and commentary by Julia
Child and Jacques Pepin, to go with their October PBS television
series. Also in October from Knopf is ``Not For Ourselves Alone''
about early feminists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,
by Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns, to accompany a PBS show. In
October from Morrow, ``Fooling With Words: A Celebration of Poets
and Their Craft'' by Bill Moyers, to go with a PBS special.
</P>
<P>
   A fascinating offering all to itself is ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War:
The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel'' by
scholar Richard H. Minear, published by The New Press.
</P>
<P>
   Anniversaries galore
</P>
<P>
   What don't we celebrate?
</P>
<P>
   Graywolf Press celebrates its 25th anniversary with an
impressive literary anthology. Coming in November, the Iowa Writers
Workshop marks 30 years with an anthology and essays by Tom Grimes,
director of the graduate writing program at Southwest Texas State
University.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Kansas Centennial edition of ``The Wizard of
Oz'' by L. Frank Baum, with an introduction by Ray Bradbury.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs, memoirs
</P>
<P>
   Summer memoirs by thirtysomethings following in the wake of
``Bridget Jones's Diary'' are giving way to stronger stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the sequel to Frank McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes''
(Scribner, September), a memoir of his Irish-American childhood.
Called `` 'Tis,'' it chronicles his journey from impoverished
immigrant to best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lanterns,'' (Beacon Press, October) by Marian Wright Edelman,
president of the Children's Defense Fund, recalls the mentors who
inspired her.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ``Lonesome
Dove,'' presents a self-portrait that says a lot about small-town
Texas in ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen, Reflections at Sixty
and Beyond'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, November).
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Frederick and Steven Barthelme describe a period after
their parents and brother Donald died when they lost almost
$250,000 gambling (Houghton Mifflin, November). And Willie Morris
has an intriguing title, ``My Cat Spit McGee'' (Random House,
November).
</P>
<P>
   Bantam is publishing John Glenn's memoir (written with Nick
Taylor) in November, and several publishers have books about space.
Knopf has a fascinating photo book called ``Full Moon'' selected
from 32,000 pictures taken by Apollo Astronauts. Yale University
has ``The Planets'' by David McNab and James Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Serious issues
</P>
<P>
   Following the violence at Columbine High School, some books look
particularly timely. Child psychologist and mystery author Jonathan
Kellerman has the nonfiction ``Savage Spawn: Reflections on Violent
Children'' (Library of Contemporary Thought, September). Richard
Rhodes has a new book on why people commit violence called, ``Why
They Kill'' (Knopf, September).
</P>
<P>
   Some books stand alone. ``Africana: The Encyclopedia of the
African and African American Experience,'' edited by Kwame Anthony
Appiah and Henry Louis Gates Jr., is a comprehensive reference due
out in November from HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cahill's ``Desire of the Everlasting Hills'' is also
unique. The author of ``The Gifts of the Jews'' interprets the
cultural impact of Jesus and early Christianity (Nan Talese,
November).
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Cantrell's book for Yale University Press on Stephen F.
Austin should command interest here, as will David Dillon's
University of Texas Press book, ``The Architecture of O'Neil Ford:
Celebrating Place'' (November).
</P>
<P>
   Fiction to watch includes: ``At the Full and Change of the
Moon'' by Dionne Brand; ``Personal Injuries'' by Scott Turow;
``Headlong,'' by Michael Frayn; ``Timeline,'' by Michael Crichton;
``The Great Shame'' by Thomas Keneally; ``Walkin' the Dog'' by
Walter Mosley; ``In America'' by Susan Sontag; ``Peel Me Like an
Onion'' by Ana Castillo; and, for Christmas, ``When Angels Sing''
by Turk Pipkin.

 &HT;    Exercise clothes help moms-to-be work out
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed until Sunday, May 9
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bess Hilpert exercised through each of her three
pregnancies _ as a result, she says, she felt better about herself
and recovered from labor and delivery quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem: She had trouble finding workout clothes
that were suitable. She'd buy one outfit, then have to move up to
the next size, then another, then another. None of the exercise
clothes she found provided good support for her belly or back, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   That frustration turned itself into a business. Mothers in
Motion, the company Hilpert founded and launched this spring with
Virginia Harrison, makes leggings, running and bike shorts, briefs,
unitards, sports bras and other exercise wear for expectant
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers in Motion isn't the only company in the United States
making fitness wear for pregnant women _ Fit Maternity and Beyond
in Mount Shasta, Calif., has created some items, as have Fit for
Two Maternity in Littleton, N.H., among others _ but Hilpert says
her products offer the best support.
</P>
<P>
   She patented a paneled inner-support system used in each
garment. Belly halters in the clothing bear the weight of the
uterine wall; there is also a back panel at the base of the spine
and two inner-thigh panels for the leggings, unitards and shorts,
as well as a special design for bras. The lining of the clothes is
a high-tech fabric made by DuPont, which keep them cool to wear.
</P>
<P>
   James Clapp, author of the book ``Exercising Through Your
Pregnancy'' and a physician at Case Western Reserve University
Medical Center in Cleveland, is testing the Mothers in Motion
clothing in a clinical study. In time-motion studies, he is
comparing the clothing to other exercise gear used by pregnant
women. Although the research isn't complete, Clapp says that ``in
general, women in mid and late pregnancy find that Bess's garments
are more comfortable and offer more in the way of breast, back and
abdominal support than their usual exercise garb.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers in Motion is an outgrowth of Hilpert's experience as an
exercise physiologist. In the 1980s, she ran her own company, Bess
Gatewood Stretch and Alignment. (Gatewood is her maiden name.) She
designed rehabilitation or exercise programs for clients, including
celebrities like Jodie Foster, Bette Midler and Olivia Newton-John.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling business is run out of Hilpert's home in Round
Rock. A factory in California makes the items; they are stored in a
warehouse in Austin, and phone operators in Austin take sales
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison worked as a runway model, showroom model and a ``fit''
model for many years, and that experience is invaluable, Hilpert
says. As a ``fit'' model, Harrison would try on clothes for
designers and tell them how well the garment moved, if it clung to
one side for too long, if a shoulder was too tight. They would
remake or alter clothing designs based on her input. Now, they draw
on Harrison's experience in the fashion industry and Hilpert's
experience in the fitness industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are young, Hilpert's sons _ Eddie, 6, Nathaniel,
5, and Calvin, 4 _ know their mother's business is important to
her, she says. ``They believe in what Mommy's doing. My boys also
understand it is for them, and they were my inspiration.''

 &HT;    Resurrecting the mummies
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Universal Pictures has been dying to resurrect
one of its classic horror franchises. Over the last decade,
Hollywood has dug up Dracula (``Bram Stoker's Dracula''),
Frankenstein (``Mary Shelley's Frankenstein''), the Wolf Man
(``Wolf,'' with Jack Nicholson) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (``Mary
Reilly''), with only marginal success. ``The Mummy'' was the last
Universal monster left from the studio's horror movie heyday in the
1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   The 1932 original starred Boris Karloff, fresh from his success
a year earlier as Frankenstein's monster, in the title role. His
3,700-year-old mummy is an Egyptian high priest named Imhotep who
was buried alive for sacrilege. He is inadvertently brought back to
life by a young archaeologist and attempts to reunite with his lost
love, an ancient princess who has been reincarnated as a beautiful
young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Universal made four more Mummy movies, three with Lon Chaney
Jr., through 1944. Britain's Hammer Films did a 1959 version, also
called ``The Mummy,'' with Christopher Lee in the title role,
followed by three sequels.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation opens today, starring Brendan Fraser,
Rachel Weisz and Arnold Vosloo. Its storyline is similar to the
Karloff original. But the $80 million update's path to the screen
was as slow as the somnambulistic Mummy itself.
</P>
<P>
   British novelist and director Clive Barker first envisioned a
bloody and futuristic treatment, like his ``Hellraiser'' films.
Next up was Joe Dante, whose horror credits include ``Gremlins''
and ``The Howling.'' Working with John Sayles, he came up with a
contemporary romantic version in which the Mummy escapes from a Los
Angeles museum exhibit. Then came attempts by George Romero
(``Night of the Living Dead'') and Mick Garris (``The Stand''
television miniseries). Finally, screenwriter Kevin Jarre (``The
Devil's Own'') delivered a dark, horrific treatment set during the
1920s frenzy that followed the discovery of King Tutankamen's tomb,
like the original.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Sommers (``Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book'')
reportedly toned down the R-rated horror aspects of Jarre's story
in favor of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark''-inspired action, adventure
and romance. He also strived to make the film funny, but not campy.
State-of-the-art special effects by Industrial Light &AMP; Magic turn
South African actor Vosloo into a decaying villain with visible
organs, which he appropriates from the living to regenerate
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the Mummy's return, we take a brief look back at his
cinematic ancestors. A wrapper's delight, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (1932)
</P>
<P>
   Released on home video Tuesday, this first-rate horror classic
is still remarkably chilling _ thanks to Karl Freund's stylized
direction, superb makeup and atmosphere, and one of Karloff's very
best performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Hand'' (1940)
</P>
<P>
   The first of Universal's ``Kharis'' series featured Tom Tyler in
moldering linen and introduced many Mummy conventions, such as high
priests and Tanis leaves. It also combined comedy with chills, as
when an old priest says, ``Kharis rests on de udder side ub dis
mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Tomb'' (1942)
</P>
<P>
   Chaney went under wraps for this weak sequel to ``The Mummy's
Hand,'' in which Kharis is transported to America. After being
revived by high priest Turan Bey, he escapes from a New England
museum to kill the surviving members of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Ghost'' (1944)
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly unkillable Kharis (Chaney) and mad high priest John
Carradine stalk a striking woman (Ramsay Ames) who is the
reincarnation of Princess Ananka. The only new wrinkle in this
routine chiller is the climactic fate of the heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Curse'' (1944)
</P>
<P>
   Last seen sinking into a Massachusetts swamp, Kharis (Chaney)
and Ananka (Virginia Christine) unaccountably rise from the
Louisiana bayou to be sent on a rampage by a pair of high priests.
Creepy and fast-paced, despite the screwloose material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955)
</P>
<P>
   Until today, Abbott and Costello's final Universal horror-comedy
was also the last gasp there for the Mummy. The somewhat amusing
slapstick adventure finds Bud and Lou in Egypt and running from two
mummies _ one real and one fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (1959)
</P>
<P>
   Hammer licensed the creature from Universal for a lavish
updating of the Mummy legend, with Christopher Lee as a terrifying
4,000-year-old Egyptian that rises to take revenge on
archaeologists who desecrated the tomb of his beloved Ananka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curse of the Mummy's Tomb'' (1964)
</P>
<P>
   A handsomely photographed but slow-moving Hammer thriller in
which the vengeful Mummy (Dickie Owen) is brought back to Victorian
London by a crass American showman. He goes on the usual spree,
killing those pesky profaners of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Shroud'' (1967)
</P>
<P>
   Hammer's Mummy series continue to unravel with this bomb about a
British expedition returning home with a mummified child pharaoh.
They are killed off by the boy's mummy guardian, revived by reading
the words on the pharaoh's shroud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood From the Mummy's Tomb'' (1971)
</P>
<P>
   The last of Hammer's Mummy movies is a satisfying chiller
adapted from the Bram Stoker novel, ``Jewel of the Seven Stars.''
An Egyptologist is obsessed with reviving an evil, ancient Egyptian
queen, whose spirit takes the form of a young girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awakening'' (1980)
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the same Stoker novel, this early film by ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral'' director Mike Newell has Charlton Heston
discovering a high priestess' tomb at the exact moment his daughter
is born. ``Get your stinking hands off me, you damn, dirty Mummy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Walker'' (1982)
</P>
<P>
   A low-budget stinker about an alien buried in King Tut's tomb
who awakens and wreaks havoc on a Southern California college
campus.

 &HT;    Doff your top hat to celebrate Astaire's 100th birthday
 &HT;    By Steve Uhler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Can't act. Can't sing. Balding. Can dance a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nameless movie studio executive wrote that curt assessment
after seeing Fred Astaire's first screen test. The man who wrote it
has long been forgotten, but everybody knows Fred Astaire, right?
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it _ there's not much of a market for Fred Astaire
these days. And the anonymous executive's critique wasn't totally
off the mark. As a screen presence, Astaire simply couldn't compete
with Cary Grant or Clark Gable _ or even Harpo Marx. The image of
Astaire that exists today is an evocative icon from another period
and place altogether. And his raison d'etre _ the movie musical _
is as extinct as the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   But the man could dance. And when he did, the real world _ and
all critical carping _ faded into insignificance. Astaire
transported audiences to an elegant fantasy world of exotic
locales, huge art deco sets, impossibly glossy floors, impeccably
tailored top hats and tails, lavish gowns ... and, above all,
passionate, romantic dances. He looked so natural on his feet that
it appeared he could dance before he could think. Astaire in motion
was the personification of carefree sophistication, natural grace
and style.
</P>
<P>
   Monday marks Fred Astaire's 100th birthday. Celebrate his
centennial in style by renting any of these great videos (and if
you want to slip off your shoes and try dancing along, who's
looking?).
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Top Hat'' (1935) is quintessential Astaire, with all the
elements that made movie musical magic: a classic score by Irving
Berlin (``Cheek to Cheek,'' ``Isn't It a Lovely Day?''), superb
dance routines (choreographed by Hermes Pan), great comedic support
(by Edward Everett Horton), stunning white art deco designs and,
above all, Ginger Rogers. Astaire and Rogers went together like ...
well, like Astaire and Rogers. Katharine Hepburn once said that
Astaire gave Rogers class, and she gave him sex. ``Top Hat'' is the
most sexually charged of their films together. Keep an eye out for
a young Lucille Ball in the flower shop.
</P>
<P>
   Most Astaire-Rogers musicals had throwaway plots, often
involving mistaken identities that only served as jumping-off
points for their awesome dance numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shall We Dance?'' (1937) is no exception, with Rogers and
Astaire as a dance team pretending to be married through such
Gershwin classics as ``Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'' and ``They
Can't Take That Away From Me.'' It was around this time that RKO
had Astaire's legs insured for a half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Carefree'' (1938) is almost more of a screwball comedy than
a musical. Rogers plays a radio star who falls for psychiatrist
Astaire even though she's engaged to his best friend (perennial
lady-loser Ralph Bellamy.) Music by Irving Berlin includes
``Dancing in the Dark.'' The highlight is a beautifully
choreographed tour of a country club. This was one of their last
films together.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Easter Parade'' (1948) is a Technicolor Pygmalion-esque
comedy with Astaire as a Henry Higgins-like dance instructor to
Judy Garland's wholesome novice, the only time these two stars were
paired together. If Astaire's opening number, ``Drum Crazy,''
doesn't pick up your pulse, you're rhythmically dead. Garland
shines in a superb comic performance _ and she never looked better
(except maybe in ``Meet Me in St. Louis''). The highlight is their
rendition of ``A Couple of Swells,'' dressed as tramps.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Astaire's gift for creating inventive ways
to showcase his solos reached its zenith.
</P>
<P>
   _ In ``Royal Wedding'' (1951), Astaire co-stars with Jane Powell
as a brother and sister musical act who travel to England to
perform. Their journey coincides with the marriage of Princess
Elizabeth (soon to be Queen Elizabeth II); naturally, they both
find romance. In one sequence, Astaire dances with a hat stand _
and makes it look as graceful and animated as any of his two-legged
partners. This is also the film in which he ecstatically dances on
the walls and ceilings to ``You're All the World to Me,'' a
seamless blending of dance and movie magic. Don't try this at home.
</P>
<P>
   Also recommended: ``The Gay Divorcee'' (1934), ``Follow the
Fleet'' (1936), and ``Band Wagon'' (1953) and ``Silk Stockings''
(1957), both with the wondrous Cyd Charisse.

 &HT;    MACK OFFERS MAJOR TAX-CUT PLAN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republican senators wrangled Thursday over how
extensive a tax cut to push for, Sen. Connie Mack introduced a
wish-list bill Thursday that contains $755 billion in cuts over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, R-Fla., offered his proposal prior to a closed-door
meeting of Republican senators to discuss ways of offering a
phased-in tax cut that could be touted during next year's elections
but which would not have much impact until years later.
</P>
<P>
   Mack is the third-highest ranking GOP senator, chairman of the
Joint Economic Committee, and a member of the tax-writing Senate
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal which would offer a $140 billion cut over five
years before ballooning in later years has not been introduced as a
bill. A committee spokeswoman said Mack has just begun seeking
cosponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Unprepared for the cost of the war in Yugoslavia and boxed in by
their promises not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for tax
cuts, Republicans are seeking a plan that will allow them to claim
tax relief before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's not a matter of if we cut, but how much, and
how we can maximize the pro-growth impact of whatever tax cuts we
decide to enact,'' Mack said during a Senate floor speech.
</P>
<P>
   While pondering how to give workers a tax cut, Republicans are
giving serious consideration to President Clinton's proposals to
close several corporate tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to see where there are opportunities to raise
revenues so we can give the working people a tax cut,'' said Sen.
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
``We want to give as large a tax cut as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack's bill would increase the standard income tax deduction
from $4,300 to $7,200 for individuals and double it from $7,200 to
$14,400 for couples, thus eliminating the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' for joint returns.
</P>
<P>
   It would cut capital gains rates by 25 percent, slash dividend
tax rates, repeal estate and gift taxes, and give permanent tax
credits for research and development expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would reduce the amount of Social Security benefits
subject to income taxes from 85 percent to the 50 percent level
that existed before the 1993 tax bill.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ What is left of the 900 block of Windermere Drive
still curves gently on this Oklahoma City suburb's western edge,
but it is a jumble now of splinters, shards and half-loaded pickup
trucks, its few remaining walls rarely rising higher than four
feet.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the many blocks that felt the full force of the
monster tornado that clawed through central Oklahoma on Monday
night. Now, three days after the disaster, most families have
either finished picking through the rubble or were making a few
last forays in search of family photos and heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergency people came out here and told us that after we
were finished taking what we could find, they were going to cart
off what they could and then just burn the rest,'' said Roger
Hanes, standing outside the shoulder-high rubble of his home at 929
Windermere Dr. ``They said there's no place in the world to bury
all this stuff, so they're going to have to burn it. Then I guess
we'll all have to decide whether to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency in epic disasters like this to take the
eagle's eye view and see it from high above, the long trail of
debris stretching into the distance, or to focus instead on tiny
details, like children's toys caught in the rubble. But it is at
the intermediate level, of individual homes and blocks, that
disasters like this are really felt. That is how it is on the 900
block of Windermere Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma officials said Thursday that the fatality toll from
Monday's storm had risen with the deaths overnight of three of the
injured in area hospitals and now stood at 41 in Oklahoma and five
in neighboring Kansas. In addition, 1 Texas woman was killed on
Tuesday in a tornado and four people died in another string of
twisters in Tennessee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma officials spent much of Thursday trying to whittle away
at the list of those still unaccounted for following Monday's
storms, a list that reached 100 names on Wednesday, and were able
to report by late afternoon that, after comparing lists of those at
shelters and motels and receiving a flurry of calls from people who
wanted to report that they were still alive, only 14 names remained
on the list of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   There was guarded optimism that most of these would turn up,
too.
</P>
<P>
   On the 900 block of Windermere Drive, residents said they were
confident that all of their neighbors had been accounted for. They
counted themselves fortunate, too, that apparently no one on their
block had died in the storm, though a few had been wounded and
three had been killed on neighboring blocks in their square-mile
1970s subdivision of two-story, brick-and-frame houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was this neighborhood like?'' asked Darrell Brooks,
paging through a recently unearthed photo album in the driveway of
his home at 1000 Windermere Dr. ``Oh, it was pretty much like this,
kind of trashy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks laughed and shook his head. ``No, I'm just kidding,'' he
said. ``It was a normal, everyday middle-class community, a slice
of the Midwest heartland. Everybody took care of their lawns,
everybody got along.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Butch Phillips were trying to toss aside the last
remaining shards of dry wall and two-by-four to see what was buried
beneath what had been their garage at 924 Windermere. The couple
were wellknown on the street as hosts of the annual block party, a
combination potluck and barbecue usually held in their front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have another block party, too, we are,''
Phillips said before breaking down, briefly, in a wave of sobs.
``Sorry, I can talk again now. As soon as we get this cleaned up,
we're going to have a block party right on this driveway. We're
taking down the numbers of where everybody is and we're bringing
them back. We're going to build this neighborhood back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Grief, for the most part, was buried beneath veneers of
camaraderie and dark humor. Phillips had put a sign on the front of
the ruins of his house offering it for sale as ``a fixer upper.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the block, Beverly Rushie could not stop laughing about the
Valentine's Day card from her granddaughter. The computer chip
embedded in it had been broken in the storm and now played the
theme song from ``Love Story'' over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-one years and not a shingle disturbed before now,''
said Alice Brooks, Darrell's wife. ``We had just retired and bought
an RV and were getting ready to travel. Man, we thought we were
settled in. It just goes to show you never to be complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pollard worked up on the tottering second-story of his
home at 917 Windermere Dr., which had been the only house in the
vicinity to retain its upper floor. ``Must have been built right,''
Pollard said. ``Either that, or we're just lucky. It's a mess
though, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Several groups moved up and down the block with camcorders. An
almost constant traffic jam clogged the street with rental trucks,
insurance representatives, police, television station vans and even
giddy residents who had managed to get their tornado-battered
vehicles started and were driving them, improbably, for one last
time.
</P>
<P>
   The mounds of debris were also aswarm with search parties from
neighboring blocks looking for household items that had been
carried off by the winds.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Piper, whose head had barely missed being crushed by a
neighbor's truck that landed on her grandfather's house a couple of
blocks away while she huddled in a bathtub under a mattress on
Monday night, was looking for the family's 16-foot ski boat. It had
mysteriously disappeared, apparently carried through the air, from
the rubble of their attached garage.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if her neighborhood had a name, Ms. Piper scratched
her head. ``Doesn't really have one,'' she said. ``Gone with the
Wind, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Carter could not look for what had become of his four
vintage cars because he was in intensive care in a nearby hospital,
his scalp sheared back, his leg broken and a nail impaled in his
chest. So several relatives were combing the debris. Carter's 1940
Chevy had flown a few feet across his front yard, his 1925 Ford
pickup was upside down about 50 yards away, in someone's back yard,
and his 1960 Chevy Impala was half buried in Hanes' front yard. But
they were still looking for the red 1971 Super Sport that had taken
wing and disappeared.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hanes had found something else in his front yard, a purse that
he at first thought belonged to his wife. But when he opened it, he
discovered that it belonged to Karen Doshier, who had improbably
survived with just a few bruises in the knee-high rubble that had
been her house just across the street from Hanes at 926 Windermere
Dr.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jerry Doshier, is an assistant chief in Moore's
fire department, and he had been working on the roof of City Hall
several blocks away when the tornado plowed through his
neighborhood. ``I saw it lift the roof off of my house and I just
lost it,'' Doshier said. ``Then I got over here and I saw her come
climbing out and it was like, I don't know, it was like I could
think again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doshier had huddled in a ball on the floor of her bedroom
closet, a battery-powered lantern in one hand and her purse in the
other. ``She said that she felt this rush of air and then she was
shaking back and forth, real fast, and all of a sudden there was
the sky over her head,'' Doshier said. ``She came up out of a hole
that was maybe two feet deep and a foot-and-a-half around with only
three or four bruises. She thought she was the only one left alive.
I mean, look at that rubble. That's all that's left of the house.
How she came out of that alive, I'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The lantern was found about 30 yards away in the front yard,
broken in half. The purse, its contents intact, was another 20
yards away in Hanes' front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand,'' Doshier said. ``Something like
this shows you, all of this stuff, all of this rubble, it's just
things, it's just stuff. It doesn't mean anything. It's only people
that mean anything. It's true. I mean it. See, that's my truck over
there, that Dodge. Do you want it? Here's the keys. It doesn't mean
anything. People have to know that.''

   A Lost Treasure To Be Auctioned
</P>
<P>
   A haunting landscape by the Hudson River School master Frederic
Edwin Church is being offered for sale at Sotheby's in New York on
May 27. The painting, which features a cross in the foreground,
comes with an unusual past.
</P>
<P>
   For years it was lost and known to Church scholars only from
passing references. But in 1980 it was rediscovered hanging in the
Des Moines Women's Club, where it had been since the group received
it in 1952. Club members knew the painting not as ``To the Memory
of Cole,'' as the artist had named it, but as ``Sunrise in the
Catskills.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Church scholars, David C. Huntington, who died in 1990, and
J. Gray Sweeney, an art history professor at Arizona State
University, had spent years looking for ``To the Memory of Cole,''
which Church painted in memory of his teacher, Thomas Cole, in
April 1848, two months after Cole's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had found two references to the painting from newspaper
clippings in the early 1970s,'' said Sweeney. ``Then one day in
1979 I got a call from David Huntington, who said he had been
contacted by the Des Moines Women's Club, which wanted him to look
at a Church they owned. He asked me if I'd go instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney remembers the moment he first saw the painting. ``It was
like an electric charge, a powerful moment of recognition,'' he
said. ``It can only be described as a national treasure. It's an
audacious, daring statement by a 22-year-old genius who is saying:
`I am a Cole student. I shall wear his mantle.'''
</P>
<P>
   The painting was originally owned by George Austen, a New York
auctioneer. The work predates Asher B. Durand's monumental
``Kindred Spirits,' now in the collection of the New York Public
Library, which had long been considered the only painting to
commemorate Cole's death.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Cole was working on a series of
allegorical paintings called ``The Cross and the World,'' and they
directly influenced ``To the Memory of Cole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Church saw the cross as a symbol, or perhaps an ideal or
proposed tombstone, but one never realized it was for Cole's
tomb,'' said Sweeney. ``The rays of morning light that illuminate
the cross symbolize rebirth.''
</P>
<P>
   In an economic climate where top American paintings are hard to
come by and prices keep rising, Sotheby's estimates that the
painting could sell for $5 million to $8 million. The proceeds will
go to create an endowment for the upkeep of the Des Moines Women's
Club's 1907 building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see it go, it's like my baby,'' said Anabelle
Wonders, a former executive director of the club. The painting is
in a collection of about 60 works, European and American, that the
club owns and exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wonders said the club first began talking to Sotheby's in
the 1980s. At the time, she said, the members did not really want
to part with it. And American paintings were not as highly valued
then as they are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an iconic painting,'' said Dara Mitchell, director of
American paintings at Sotheby's. ``Obviously, great paintings by
Church rarely come on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell noted that Sotheby's seems to get the chance to
sell a work like this about every 10 years. In 1979 the auction
house sold Church's ``Iceberg,'' which became the first American
painting to sell for more than $1 million. (It made $2.5 million.)
In 1989 Sotheby's sold the artist's famous image ``Home by the
Lake'' for $8.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Church's first great statement,'' said Sweeney.
``Today there are only about a half-dozen Churches left in private
hands, and this is the best of them. It's my greatest hope that a
museum will buy it so it can stay in the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Rarity
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Accord,'' one of the last Watteau paintings in
private hands, has been given to the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art by the Ahmanson Foundation, a Los Angeles-based foundation that
is a longtime supporter of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, from around 1716, depicts five elegantly dressed
people in a wooded park. A man in the center is playing the flute
and a young woman beside him is singing. It was painted for the
artist's friend Nicholas Henin, who oversaw architectural projects
for the French court.
</P>
<P>
   After changing hands several times, the painting was bought in
1892 by the Iveagh family of Britain and remained in the family
until recently. One of Lord Iveagh's daughters, Lady Bridget Ness,
the wife of Prince Frederic of Prussia, was the family's last
owner. ``She loved it so much she had a special case made and took
it with her wherever she went,'' said Graham W.J. Beal, director of
the Los Angeles County Museum. When she died a year ago, Simon
Dickinson, who has galleries in New York and London, sold the
painting to the foundation on behalf of the family trustees.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first Watteau to enter the museum's collection and is
on view in the Carter Gallery. This is the first time ``The Perfect
Accord'' has been seen publicly in more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having a Watteau has been a notable gap,'' Beal said.
``The preparatory drawing for the work is also in Los Angeles, at
the Getty.''
</P>
<P>
   Help for Uncle Sam
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Pavilion at the 1999 Venice Biennale opens June 12
with the installation and performance artist Ann Hamilton, the
exhibition will have corporate sponsorship for the first time, and
the sponsor is Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci and its creative director, Tom Ford, have over the years
financed decorative arts, photography and performing arts projects
in London, Japan and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Venice installation is also receiving support from the
United States Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions,
which is a partnership of the U.S. Information Agency, the National
Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew
Charitable Trust.

NATO, RUSSIA AGREE TO FRAMEWORK FOR POLITICAL END TO KOSOVO CRISIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Russia and the NATO alliance have agreed on
a framework for seeking peace for Kosovo, including the need for an
armed international force to secure the return of hundreds of
thousands of refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached early Thursday at a meeting of the
world's eight leading economic powers, does not address the makeup
of any security force or Russia's demand for an immediate end to
NATO's bombing campaign, now in its seventh week.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the agreement by Russia _ a longtime ally of
Yugoslavia _ for an armed security force in Kosovo is expected to
further isolate Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and increase
pressure on him to end the conflict on terms dictated by the United
States and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step forward,'' President Clinton said
during a meeting in Bonn with German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder.
``I think you have to read this as a move forward and (as)
increasing the likelihood that there'll ultimately be a resolution
of this that will actually work.''
</P>
<P>
   While working out details of the agreement and a decision by
Milosevic to pull out of Kosovo, Clinton said the bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real peace process under way, but it has no chance
of reaching a satisfactory conclusion unless we maintain allied
unity and firmness,'' Clinton told reporters as he wrapped up a
two-day European trip to visit U.S. troops and Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of changing policies until the basic
conditions are met,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's framework for a political end to the Kosovo crisis
was adopted by foreign ministers from seven Western powers and
Russia _ known as the G-8 or Group of Eight _ meeting in Bonn. Once
details of the plan are worked out, it will be submitted for
approval to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by the G-8, the plan calls for immediate end to
violence and repression in Kosovo; withdrawal of Serbian military,
police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo; deployment of a U.N.
peacekeeping force; a U.N.-supervised administration of Kosovo to
aid the transition to self-government; return of all refugees and
displaced people; unimpeded access to Kosovo by international aid
groups; and comprehensive economic redevelopment of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers also agreed to keep China informed of
negotiations, hoping that with Russia now aboard, China _ a member
of the Security Council _ would not veto any resolution calling for
involvement of U.N. forces in post-war Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan called the agreement ``an
important'' step toward reaching a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   State-run media in Yugoslavia quoted Milosevic as saying that a
political or diplomatic settlement was possible after NATO halts
its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Under relentless bombing since March 24 by NATO, Milosevic has
softened his long-held opposition to any peacekeeping force in
Kosovo. Before the bombing, Milosevic's negotiators refused to
discuss the concept at talks in Rambouillet, France. Over the past
two weeks, the Yugoslav president has said he would consider a
peacekeeeping contingent that was unarmed or carried only light
weapons. At the same time, he has insisted on keeping 11,000 Serb
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals by Milosevic have been turned down by NATO, a
rejection underscored Thursday when Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright reaffirmed their desire for ``a strong military
force with NATO at its core'' to ensure the security of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Albright characterization of allied involvement in
post-war peacekeeping has shifted in recent weeks from a demand
that NATO forces be deployed in Kosovo to the use of NATO-led
forces to, as described Thursday, having NATO troops at the
``core'' of any foreign military presence in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia has objected to a peacekeeping force directed
and dominated by NATO, Sandy Berger, the president's national
security adviser, said the agreement Thursday shows an evolution in
Moscow's position. ``I think Russia is moving toward the NATO
position,'' he told reporters aboard Air Force One between Bonn and
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing of the gap between Washington and Moscow could
influence Milosevic's calculations. ``The Serbs have to see they
are increasingly isolated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials argued that the agreement worked out with the
United States, Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Italy and Japan
signals more movement by the Clinton administration than Russia.
The agreement reflects Moscow's call for an international presence
in Kosovo under the direction of the Security Council, said Sergey
Lavrow, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad that this is now accepted by our Western partners,''
Lavrow told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry that it took them one and a half months of bombing
to come to the same solution which we were offering,'' Lavrow said,
failing to mention Russia's long-held opposition, until Thursday,
to arming any international forces deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that we are already there,'' the ambassador
said. ``We would still have to see how the details of those
arrangements could be negotiated, and this would require good will
on both sides as was repeatedly stressed by Russian leadership.''

CABLE OFFERS REFUGE FROM MAY SWEEPS SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week into May sweeps, and the dread settles heavily on the
critic's brow. Can there be another ``Noah's Ark'' lurking on the
schedule? Dare we peek ahead? One might think the odds of something
so vile emerging again in a matter of days or weeks would be
astronomical. And yet February sweeps managed to disfavor us with
``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story'' and ``The '60s''
within a fortnight of each other. Clearly, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   At moments like these, it's comforting to find refuge in cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Channel on Friday features the world premiere of
``Me &AMP; Will,'' a flawed but strangely compelling film by Melissa
Behr and Sherrie Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Part ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' and part ``Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance,'' this profanely personal buddy movie
follows two drugged-out L.A. biker women who meet each other in
rehab and decide to stay on the wagon while taking a road trip in
search of Peter Fonda's star-spangled Harley from ``Easy Rider.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing, producing and directing, Behr and Rose
play the main characters, Jane and Will, which is part of the
film's problem. They're much better behind the camera than in front
of it. But ``Me &AMP; Will'' still has a spark that's hard to resist,
particularly as Jane and Will search for Fonda's chopper and
viewers get to guess at its metaphorical significance.
</P>
<P>
   Behr is the better actress, but she and Rose both manage to keep
the film watchable by weaving a tale that matches ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' for moments of cynicism and despair while ultimately
embracing hope. It's a worthy entrant in Sundance's ``She Said
Cinema'' celebration, a monthlong survey of independent women
filmmakers, spotlighting nearly 40 films and shorts from 10
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works featured this month are ``The Tango Lesson,''
from British director Sally Potter (``Orlando'), airing May 21;
``Not 14 Again,'' a documentary by Australia's Gillian Armstrong
(``My Brilliant Career''), airing Sunday, and ``Six Days, Six
Nights,'' by France's Diane Kurys, airing May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Kurys' films, the acclaimed ``Entre Nous,'' starring
Isabelle Huppert and Miou-Miou, airs this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Short films airing at various times this month include ``Peel''
by Jane Campion (``The Portrait of a Lady'') and ``gunshy,''
directed by Maura Naughton and starring Parker Posey.

`THREE SEASONS' IS A GRIPPING, IMMENSELY SATISFYING FILM 
</HEADLINE>
 SEASONS-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year-and-a-half ago, I happened to be walking down a side
street in Saigon when I happened upon a shoe-string film crew
shooting what they claimed was the ``first-ever American feature
film'' to be shot in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to the crew members and the 26-year-old
Vietnamese-American director, Tony Bui, I distinctly remember
thinking that the script sounded cliched, and _ even though Harvey
Keitel had been talked into being in a few scenes _ the movie
didn't have the future of a snowball in hell.
</P>
<P>
   Well, never underestimate a determined young man with a dream.
That film, ``Three Seasons,'' turned out to be the hit of the last
Sundance Film Festival, and one of the most accomplished, lyrical,
beautifully textured first films I've seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically an omnibus movie that weaves together the stories
of four Saigon characters: a young woman (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) who has
just come to work on a suburban lotus farm, a street urchin named
Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc), a cyclo driver (Don Duong), and an ex-U.S.
Marine (Harvey Keitel).
</P>
<P>
   The young woman, unable to sell her flowers in a Saigon more
interested in plastic flower replicas, gradually withdraws into a
dreamy longing for a lost past and develops a ``beauty and the
beast'' relationship with a reclusive poet with leprosy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy Woody (named after the Woody Woodpecker T-shirt he
wears), sells wristwatches and other trinkets from a suitcase
provided by a child-exploiting Fagin, and his story involves his
frantic quest to recover that suitcase when it disappears during a
blackout at Saigon's ``Apocalypse Now'' bar.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclo driver has fallen in love with a prostitute (Zoe Bui)
who hangs out at the city's posh Majestic Hotel, and his story
involves his efforts to acquire enough money to buy her services
and taste the luxury of one night in a four-star hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And the Vietnam-veteran Marine has returned to Saigon to search
for the daughter he fathered 30 years ago, but mostly just boozes
it up in the bars of the Rue Catinet by night, and pathetically
wanders the streets by day, like some ghost of the old American
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Director Bui follows these four quests rather lightly,
occasionally mixing them up (as when Woody believes the Marine has
stolen his suitcase), and his intention is less narrative drive
than a sequence of scenes that collectively create a kind of visual
``symphony'' of a Saigon in lightning transition.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gorgeous movie in which every shot seems imaginative and
revealingly composed, and yet _ like ``The Bicycle Thief'' and
other great Italian neo-realist classics of the post-war '40s _ it
still has a documentary-like feel, so it's both poetic and
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``Three Seasons'' has that ring of truth and subtle
moral power that is always impossible for a filmmaker to fake. Bui,
who left Vietnam at age 2 but returned when he was 19, sees his
country with a sharp, loving, sad eye that makes his film gripping,
melancholy, immensely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Three Seasons. Directed and written by Tony Bui. Cast: Harvey
Keitel, Don Duong, Nguyen Ngoc Hiep, Tran Manh Cuong, Nguyen Huu
Duoc, Zoe Bui. October Films. 113 minutes. In Vietnamese with
English subtitles. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

`MUMMY' REMAKE TRIES TO BE EVERYTHING, FAILS AT BEING ANYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Universal Pictures announced it was planning a big-budget
remake of its 1932 horror classic, ``The Mummy,'' the word was it
would be a similarly stylish, evocative and subtle film that would
rely more on atmosphere and suggestion and less on special effects.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't happened. Somewhere along the pipeline, the
project morphed into an overblown, special-effects-o-rama comedy
that's closer in spirit to ``Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy''
than to the critically acclaimed horror movie from the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Small boys and teenagers will like ghoulish violence and goofy
imitation-Indiana Jones action sequences, but others are likely to
be bored by its numbingly predictable and repetitive non-stop
action. Devotees of the original will want to throw rocks at it.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts off in 1719 B.C. with a computer-generated
prologue that vaguely recreates the original premise _ Imhotep, a
high priest in the court of Themes, has fallen in love with the
Pharaoh's mistress, and is turned into a living mummy for his
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 1923 (the Egypt of the King Tut discovery), and the rest
of the story follows an American adventurer (Brendan Fraser) and a
clutzy Anglo-Egyptian archeologist (Rachel Weisz) who find the lost
city where the Mummy lies in a state of suspended animation, and
release him.
</P>
<P>
   But this Mummy is not so much a lovesick sap out to gain the
reincarnation of his lost love as he's a supernatural Hitler out to
enslave the world by unleashing the same series of plagues _
locusts, boils, comets, etc. _ that Moses did, as if inspired by a
recent viewing of ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a exaggerated, campy mess, and one that has no respect
for the geography and culture of ancient Egypt either _ so if
you're a fan of those endless Egyptology specials on the Discovery
Channel, you'll be overwhelmed by the inaccuracies and
anachronisms.
</P>
<P>
   It's very much one of those big-studio concoctions that try to
be everything and end up being nothing: not creepy enough to be an
effective horror movie, not funny enough to be a rollicking comedy,
not historically credible or adventurous enough to be a rousing
action spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Fraser has a few enjoyable moments as the thick-headed
hero (half-Indiana Jones/half-George of the Jungle) but the
dumbed-up script doesn't allow him to do anything with the part,
and he has zero romantic chemistry with co-star Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of today's wannabe summer blockbusters, much of the
film is digital, but the effects _ a zip through a Middle Kingdom
Egyptian city, a sea of flesh-eating scarabs, a desert storm shaped
like a mummy's face _ always look exactly like what they are:
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The Mummy. Directed and directed by Stephen Sommers. Cast:
Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin J.
O'Connor. Universal. 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 for horror violence.

BOMBING OF A KOSOVAR TOWN TRIGGERS FLIGHT AND WIDER PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ The ethnic Albanian woman, when a stranger
said hello Thursday, pulled her child's arm so hard to get away one
could almost hear the tendons pop.
</P>
<P>
   Two elderly Albanians, chatting quietly on a street corner,
scurried off when a stranger approached them to talk, heading in
opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged Albanian, walking his bicycle up one of Prizren's
ancient cobbled streets, past the shut-down stores and broken
windows, stopped politely. But when asked how his life is now, his
eyes darted convulsively as he pushed his bike away.
</P>
<P>
   This charming medieval city in deep southwestern Kosovo, where a
15th-century church hugs a steep hill just above a 14th-century
mosque, is rank with tension and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few Serbs stopped briefly to talk, the anxiety of the
people on the street is matched only by the edginess of the many
soliders and militarized policemen who fill the town, and who
stopped a reporter to check his papers nearly every time they
noticed a notebook or camera.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more soldiers and policemen visible here than in
Pristina or Pec, and a few plainclothesmen with automatic rifles
also walk the streets.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to make everyone nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, many of Prizren's Albanians, perhaps as many
as 30,000, were pushed and panicked into flight in the few days
following a bomb blast in a poor residential area that killed at
least five civilians and wounded 23 others.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of ethnic Albanians brought new charges of organized
ethnic purging from NATO officials and the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees. A spokesman for the U.N. agency, Ray Wilkinson, said
last Friday from Albania: ``To me it seems this is the final
cleansing of Prizren.''
</P>
<P>
   The city itself is hardly empty, and many Albanians, however
fearful, remain here, rarely going outside. As they walk, they
watch warily for anyone who approaches, and when they pass a
soldier, they drop their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear what happened last week in Prizren, a
city of some 180,000 people before this war began, including some
11,000 Serbs, 130,000 ethnic Albanians, 10,000 Turks, 20,000 Muslim
Slavs and Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing early last Friday of the residential area, known as
Ciganska mala, or ``Gypsy neighborhood,'' did frighten many, who
had been holed up in the houses and apartments for days, some
residents said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bombing also served as a trigger, it seems, for an
effort by Serb authorities _ which they deny _ to arrest certain
Albanians and order others to leave, setting off a wider panic.
</P>
<P>
   People rushed for the bus stations, even if no Serb came to
their door. In two days _ Friday and Saturday, while much attention
was focused on the Rev. Jesse Jackson's mission to free three
captured American soliders, residential areas of Belgrade were
bombed and a passenger bus was hit by a missile just north of
Pristina, killing 41 people _ some 30,000 ethnic Albanians from
Prizren crossed the border into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Others took buses to Pristina or to Podgorica, in Montenegro.
Refugees arriving in Albania said many people were warned to leave
by the Serbs, who charged them a dollar for the 10-mile bus ride to
the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Rexep Hoti, a 60-year-old who agreed to speak Thursday, said
that people were terrified by both the bombing and the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told some people to move, but not in my neighborhood,''
which is known as Brezovica, like the name of the resort town
nearby. ``Nobody came to tell us to leave, but some were
threatened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some left because they were told, some because they were
scared and some of them saw their neighbors leaving, so they left
too,'' he added. ``Some from the villages were sure they would be
killed, and they made a fear among the ones in the town.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped and said with wonderment: ``They just walked out of
their big houses and left them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the war, there was little bomb damage in
Prizren. ``But when the bombs landed on the houses, a lot of people
also became afraid,'' Hoti said. ``I'm afraid, too. I stay at home
and came out to buy some bread,'' lifting up a plastic bag with a
loaf inside. ``I'm not walking around much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoti is a widower, with a son in Germany. Living alone, he said,
he had less reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Hoti's comments about panic reflected those made by the U.N.
spokesman, Wilkinson, last Friday. ``We have started to hear that
panic is setting in,'' he said then. ``A lot of these people are
saying, `My God, everyone is leaving. I've got to leave.' `'
</P>
<P>
   The war came comparatively late to Prizren, where the streets
signs are written in three languages. But since NATO expanded its
air campaign in Kosovo, Prizren and its surroundings have been
bombed almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Car Dusan Silni barracks and warehouses have been hit
regularly, as well as nearby transmitter towers and other targets,
and 10 more civilians have been killed, Yugoslav authorities say.
Those people who would talk Thursday said there was an increasing
fear among everyone here about the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   There was a continuous rumble of NATO warplanes overhead,
invisible through the heavy cloud cover, and the intermittent sound
of detonations seemingly far away, echoing off Prizren's embracing
hills.

   Lubitsa Stankovic, 48, walking quickly with a friend, said:
``Everyone is afraid of the bombs and the sirens. When they were
just shooting the barracks, we were not that scared, but now when
they hit the other things and kill innocent people, it's
terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Albanians, Stankovic said: ``We're afraid,
they're afraid. A lot of people left because of fear, including
Serbs.'' Many Albanians left in the last week, she said, ``but many
are still here, and my Albanian neighbors ask me when this madness
will stop _ when they are bombing we are all together.''

artillery pieces. Overhead, like a drill in the brain, there is the
steady rumble of NATO aircraft, circling for targets.

EBOLA-LIKE VIRUS IDENTIFIED, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Authorities Thursday identified a deadly cousin
of the Ebola virus as the disease that has struck inhabitants in a
remote corner of the eastern Congo, killing as many as 52 people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the World Health Organization said they are
planning to send a team to the region this weekend to investigate
outbreak of the Marburg virus, one of the world's most lethal and
deadly diseases. Soviet biological warfare experts allegedly
converted it into a weapon in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The team will fly to Kampala, Uganda, Saturday before seeking
permission to cross into Wasa, a rebel-controlled region 30 miles
from the Ugandan border, said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the
international health organization.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known cure or vaccine for the outbreak, which was
first reported in Congo by scientists from the French organization
Doctors Without Borders. International specialists say they have
learned little about the virus since it was identified in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely no idea of the source of the virus,'' said
Hartl. ``It has caused one past outbreak and several sporadic
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Marburg, a close viral cousin of the Ebola, causes a hideous
death for those who contract it. ``Both Marburg and the closely
related Ebola virus are often characterized by the sudden onset of
fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache and conjunctivitis,''
according to a WHO statement. ``This is followed by sore throat,
vomiting, diarrhea, rash and both internal and external bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Alibek, a former Soviet biological weapons expert who
defected nearly a decade ago, described in his book ``Biohazard''
the slow, gruelling death of a Soviet colleague, Nikolai Ustinov,
who accidentally pricked his finger with a concentrated dose of
Marburg.
</P>
<P>
   The disease _ known as a viral haemorrhagic fever _ induced
fever, headaches, and nausea and shock before causing internal
bleeding and ultimately death. ``The virus prevents normal
coagulation,'' Alibek wrote. ``As the virus spreads, the body's
internal organs begin to melt away.''
</P>
<P>
   Alibek said Thursday that the Soviet Union successfully
weaponized a dry form of Marburg by 1990. He said Russia continues
to possess the capacity to attack an American city with a
Marburg-filled warhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This virus fortunately appears in isolated areas and it is not
very stable in natural conditions. That's why it doesn't cause
larger outbreaks,'' he said. But he added that an attack on a
heavily populated area by a Russian laboratory super strain could
cause ``thousands or hundreds of thousands of deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia denies that it possesses biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded outbreak of the disease occurred in 1967 at
the Behring pharmaceutical works in Marburg, Germany, which was
experimenting with green monkeys from Uganda. Thirty-one people
died during the outbreak. Two more perished from the virus during
the same year in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, scientists investigating the disease's origins
traveled to Uganda to determine the cause, according to Hartl.
While they suspected the monkeys were the culprit, they were never
able to conclusively prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the World Health Organization believes the virus is
transmitted to humans following contact with infected animals or
animal tissues. Humans can also contract it from close contact with
an infected person or infected body fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the US Center for Disease Control in Atlanta said
that a handful of smaller outbreaks have been recorded in South
Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya during the past 25 years. But the recent
case in eastern Congo is the largest yet. And it is far more
virulent that the European strain, which killed some 30 to 35
pecent of those infected by it. Of an estimated 76 cases in the
Congo, 52 have died.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control,
said the disease -- catalogued along with Ebola, Lasa fever and
Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever as a Level 4 virus -- is among the
most lethal and least understood in the world. He said a sample of
the virus would probably be made available to CDC scientists.

BRISTOL-MYERS PLEDGES $100 MILLION TO AIDS FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unprecedented effort by a private corporation to stem the
AIDS epidemic and provide care for its poorest victims, a leading
US-based pharmaceutical company Thursday pledged $100 million over
the next five years to fight AIDS in five hard-hit African nations.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution, by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., will fund
programs to prevent new AIDS-virus infections and to provide care,
including drug treatment, to a region where 3.5 million people _
more than 7 percent of the population _ are already infected. Few
can afford the costly drugs used to treat the disease in developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The additional $20 million a year amounts to a 14 percent jump
in total AIDS funding in sub-Saharan Africa, where currently only
about $140 million is available to fight the disease. South Africa,
Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland will share the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, director of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS
agency, said he hoped the drug company's move ``will be imitated by
more multinational companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The new money will be targeted in part to programs to improve
care for women and children in nations where 16 to 36 percent of
pregnant women carry the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research has shown drugs given during pregnancy can cut
in half the rate of HIV transmission from mother to infant at a
cost of about $80 per case. But providing such treatment requires a
chain of support services seldom found in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot parachute the drugs into these countries. We need
the infrastructure to deliver care,'' said Dr. Joseph Saba of
UNAIDS, who has campaigned vigorously for drug company
contributions. ``We need well-trained doctors and nurses;
laboratory facilities for people to get tested; pharmacies where
the drugs can be made available and managed properly. We need
patients to be aware of the treatments they need and how to take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a $25 million pledge this week by Microsoft's
William Gates to support AIDS vaccine research, the Bristol-Myers
Squibb contribution heartened activists who have recently worried
about a decline in AIDS-fighting support in this country and
abroad. ``It indicates a dramatic rise in interest in the global
pandemic,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action,
a Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to hear these things years ago,'' said
Jacob A. Gayle Jr., the UNAIDS liaison to the World Bank, who spoke
Thursday night at a Boston forum on African AIDS sponsored by the
21st Century Group, an organization of black professionals.
``However, hopefully 20 years hence we'll look back and say this
contribution began a whole new era of response to this epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol-Myers Squibb chairman and chief executive, Charles
A. Hiembold Jr., said the $18.3 billion-a-year firm felt ``a moral
obligation to take action against this grave situation.'' But
company executives and consultants noted that the step will serve
the drug firm's commercial interests as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty. I think the company will benefit from this,''
said Barry Scott, vice president of Bristol-Myers Squibb's
international division. ``I don't know how.. . .But I'd be avoiding
the obvious to say there would be no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Marlink of the Harvard AIDS Institute, who will
serve on a scientific advisory board for the new project, said the
contribution ``will buy goodwill. It may open doors. If I were in
the upper reaches of a pharmaceutical company very involved in AIDS
drugs, I would note that this epidemic is growing, and it's
disproportionately affecting southern Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb makes three leading AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Like other AIDS-drug manufacturers, it has recently been alarmed
by threats from some African nations to manufacture cheap,
unauthorized versions of costly AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to South Africa's health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma,
Scott added: ``Certainly we are challenging the health minister on
intellectual properties issues and we will continue to challenge
her on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said those threats ``did not enter into'' the
company's decision to contribute $100 million to South Africa and
four neighboring countries.

 &HT;    Parental influence on child limited, author says
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``If I were the father of one of those boys, how
would I go on living?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first question Harriet Lerner's husband asked when
the news of the Colorado tragedy broke and the couple learned that
students had been responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a staff psychologist and psychotherapist at the
Menninger Clinic in Kansas, shared his sentiments _ only more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers are blamed for everything and blame themselves in this
society,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In town recently to promote her new book, ``The Mother Dance,''
(Harper-Collins, $25), Lerner also has authored ``The Dance of
Anger'' and ``The Dance of Intimacy.'' ``My husband calls me the
Fred Astaire of the self-help world,'' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But she isn't laughing when she begins talking about parental
culpability for a child's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are responsible for their own behavior but they are
not responsible for their children's behavior ... which they can
influence but not control,'' she says emphatically. ``A particular
mother can behave badly, even abominably, but she cannot make her
child become a serial killer or even get straight A's.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner says there are many factors beyond a parent's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids come into the world with their own unique strands of
DNA,'' she says. ``Some kids are genuinely easy kids and some kids
are a piece of work!''
</P>
<P>
   While, in the best of all possible worlds, parents would pay
perfect attention and be perfectly attuned to their children's
thoughts and actions, Lerner says many parents are often exhausted
and hardly able to pay attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making excuses regarding neglect, abuse or even
insensitivity,'' she adds. ``I'm merely saying there are times when
parents barely get through the day. All of us make mistakes in what
we do and what we fail to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An example from her own life? When her two boys were young, the
family started off on a car trip after stopping for gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove off leaving our younger son behind in a seedy gas
station,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When she tells the story, the reaction is always laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has done things like this,'' Lerner says. ``And we
were lucky. If we had been unlucky, we might have been put in jail
in today's world. We all have vulnerabilities, limitations and `bad
mother days.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner says our society encourages mothers to cultivate guilt
like ``a little flower garden.'' Her gift to mothers on Mother's
Day, she says, would to encourage them to let go of nonproductive
self-doubt and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   When her first son was born _ in the '70s _ there was something
to make every mother feel guilty, each in her own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers who worked outside the home were told their children
would not thrive, while homemakers were depicted by the media as
idiots who drooled over their newly waxed floors,'' she says.
``Career women were pitted against stay-at-home moms.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lerner, it was a false and decisive polarity for
which feminism was then blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women today still feel on the defensive, as if differences are
a condemnation or judgment,'' she says. ``It's easy for one woman
to be critical of another woman's parenting or feel defensive about
her own choices.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lerner decided to write a book on parenting, she first went
to a giant bookstore to see what was already on the shelves. What
she discovered were ``several million'' books on the subject. What
was missing, she noted, were books from a mother's perspective:
books that told what mothering was really like from the inside and
how a woman's life was changed and transformed after her first baby
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motherhood is surrounded by such false sentimentality that
mothers are hungry to hear the voices of other women telling the
truth,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The new book is written for mothers and grandmothers of all ages
and covers experiences from conception to empty nest. Lerner shares
much from her own life. Fathers, she says, will relate to it as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What motherhood taught me is humility,'' she says. ``Before I
had kids, I was amazed at the improper behavior of other mothers
and I knew I would never do any of those things. ... I would never
scream at my kids or fight with my husband within their earshot or
feed them at McDonald's. And I definitely wasn't going to be a
worrier like my own mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she says, smiling, `` I did all those things and
more. We don't have a clue what our children will evoke in us until
we have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner says novelist Fay Weldon put it best: ``The greatest
advantage of not having children must be that you can go on
thinking you are a nice person. Once you have children, you
understand how wars start.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your kids will make you love them in a way you never dreamed
possible,'' Lerner concludes. ``They will also teach you that you
are not the calm, clear, mature, highly evolved, saintlike person
that you fancied yourself before you became a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner believes that while today's dads are deeply committed to
being more connected to their children than in previous
generations, far too much is still expected of mothers and far too
little expected of fathers in terms of the daily hands-on job of
rearing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in therapy and many modern parents who are totally
committed to shared parenting and earning do remarkably well until
the first baby comes along. Then they discover how incredibly
powerful the old roles of `man the breadwinner' and `woman the
primary nurturer' really are. It puts a tremendous strain on the
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner disagrees with some parenting advice, such as the notion
of ``letting go'' of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that any parent can be invasive, intrusive or over
controlling at any stage of the life cycle,'' she says. ``It's true
that parents need to have a profound respect for differences.
However, we should never let go. Our children always need us to
stand for connection ... even if they seek distance and even if
they refuse to speak to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead we should be reaching for deeper and more complex ways
of staying connected. Get help when you need it. Never give up on
your kids.''

   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Bonn, Germany) _ The West and Russia agreed for
the first time Thursday on the need for an international military

of Seven and Russia marked a decisive step away from the specter of
a wider conflict over the Balkans between Washington and Moscow. It
also intensified pressure on Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, by demonstrating that Russia is not ready to turn its

by European Jews before the Holocaust under a formula that reflects
the present-day value of the policies, which could potentially
result in billions of dollars in payments. By Alan Cowell.

LEE SEEN AS SYMBOL OF ASIAN COMMUNITY'S POLITICAL ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's Asian-American community flooded Senator Edward
Kennedy's Washington office two years ago with letters and phone
calls, urging him to support Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the
US Justice Department's civil-rights division.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, many of those same supporters will sit down to
hear a man they had hope will be the country's first civil rights
chief, despite Lee's repeated failed nominations. Lee, 50, the son
of a poor Chinese immigrant, symbolizes for many the entrance of
the Asian community into the country's powerful public policy
arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``African Americans have really established a strong hold in the
political arena which we are striving for,'' said George Cha,
former president of the New England Organization of
Asian-Americans. ``So, it's Bill Lann Lee . . . who we consider one
of the forerunners of success in our community.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Asian American he means our maturation into the
political process,'' he said. ``But globally he represents true
access for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The permanent appointment of Lee, currently acting attorney
general for civil rights, to the post has been delayed by vigorous
Republican opposition _ which many see as a national metaphor for
the changing face and continuing attack of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he is neither black nor white and the first Asian
American to be tapped for this post _ he is symbolic,'' said Frank
Wu, associate professor at Howard University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's nomination has been blocked by the Senate Judiciary
Committee each time it has come up since he was first chosen by
President Bill Clinton in December 1997, becoming the flash point
in the perennial debate over civil rights and affirmative action
that often occurs in an election season.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton resubmitted his nomination in March _ for the third time
_ after Congress passed a watered-down resolution condemning
discrimination in the wake of an embarrassing disclosure that two
Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and
US Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, maintained ties to the
Council of Conservative Citizens, which promotes the preservation
of the white race.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Clinton administration seized on the Republicans'
fumble to play to the minority vote, particularly Asian Americans,
who may be crucial to Vice President Al Gore's presidential
prospects in western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing a Republican candidate for president wants to
confront going into an election would be his party's unfair
rejection of a leading Asian American civil rights expert,'' said
one administration official. ``It's really not justifiable and it
would be very difficult to explain why our party did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials downplay Lee's involvement in
affirmative action cases, saying they constitute only a minute
portion of his workload at the Justice Department. Instead, they
emphasize his efforts to combat hate crimes, enforce the Americans
with Disabilities Act, and his pioneering role in promoting
mediation and alternative dispute resolution, which brings parties
together while avoiding expensive litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee's critics focus on his support of affirmative action:
``Mr. Lee thinks that the Constitution is not color-blind, but
color-coded, that the rights that an American have under the
Constitution and under civil rights laws depends on his melanin
content, where his ancestors came from and his or her sex,'' said
Roger Clegg, a former Justice Department official now general
counsel for the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Mr. Lee spends only 10 percent of his time working
on affirmative action issues,'' continued Clegg. ``Saying that he
shouldn't be criticized because of those 10 perent of the cases is
like saying the airlines shouldn't be criticized because only 10
percent of the planes crash.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House brushed aside such arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Lann Lee did not create the (affirmative action) laws,
Congress did, and if critics have a problem with the law then their
problem should be with the Congress,'' said White House spokesman
James Kennedy. ``He's caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nominee shares the views of the president and the
president deserves to have someone whose views reflect his.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's open support of affirmative action dismantles the myth
that Asian Americans oppose affirmative action and that the
argument of race and discrimination is a black and white matter,
said Wu, the Howard University Law School professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often when people assume Asians are foreigners, guests
and tourists _ they (Asian Americans) feel frustrated because the
dialogue on race is going on without them as if they didn't have a
stake in this country'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch, the Judiciary Committee chairman, who has
vehemently opposed Lee's nomination, recently gave White House
officials a glimmer of hope by asking his staff to review Lee's
record over the 1 1/2 years he's been acting attorney general.
Kennedy said administration officials view the request as a
``positive sign'' that could pave the way toward consideration of
Lee by the entire Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast, said Judiciary Committee spokeswoman, Jeanne
Lopatto. ``Senator Hatch has not changed his position on Bill Lann
Lee,'' she said Thursday, adding that the Utah Republican continues
to oppose his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno pleaded Lee's case
before the committee, which has oversight of the Justice
Department. She called him ``splendid'' to work with and said he
would ``serve you and this nation very well.'' Hatch, however, said
he was still conducting the review of Lee's tenure and was
non-commital about scheduling a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who spent two decades as a lawyer for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, was born and raised in Harlem. His parents, Chinese
immigrants, owned a small laundry. His father, who experienced
mean-spirited discrimination, inspired young Lee to pursue a career
in civil rights, according to his biography.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Bronx High School of Science, he won a
minority scholarship which helped him attend Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a man who grew up in Harlem, worked for the NAACP.
It's a rare thing to find someone who was a beneficiary of an
affirmative program and is successful and confident enough to tell
people that he would not have had doors open had it not been for
affirmative action,'' said Andrew Leong, assistant professor at the
Law Center at the University of Massachusetts. ``So he is a very
proud symbol not just for the Asian community but for people of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee studied at Yale University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in
1971. Three years later he would began a career as a civil rights
attorney which stretched for nearly a quarter of a century. His
career with the NAACP Legal Defense began in 1974 as an associate
attorney. In 1983, he left the organization to become the
supervising attorney for civil rights at The Center for Law and
Public Interest in California. He would return to the NAACP in
1988.

HARVARD PILGRIM CHIEF QUITS FOLLOWING RECORD LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care
resigned Thursday amid financial turmoil at New England's largest
health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Greenberg's abrupt departure occurred less than a week
after Harvard Pilgrim reported its largest annual loss ever and
said it would significantly raise premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Like other HMOs nationwide, Harvard Pilgrim, which insures 1.3
million people, has been buffeted by soaring prescription drug
costs, rising medical inflation and intense competitive pressure to
keep a lid on premium increases.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim did not specify the reason for Greenberg's
resignation. Its chairman Alan R. Morse said the departure was ``a
private matter between Allan and the board of directors.'' In a
memo to employees, Morse said the HMO has created a transition team
to run the company until a replacement can be found. ``Dr. Gil
Shapiro and I, along with several other members of the Board will
work with the senior management team of Harvard Pilgrim to make
sure that the important work of the organization continues without
interruption,'' Morse wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, 46, whose resignation was effective immediately, was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came swiftly after Harvard Pilgrim, which is
consistently rated one of the country's best HMOs for quality of
care, announced it lost $94 million from operations in 1998 on
revenue of $2.6 billion. A $40 million gain from interest income
helped lower the net loss to $54 million. Still, the losses were
unprecedented in magnitude for Harvard Pilgrim, which was formed in
1995 with the merger between Harvard Community Health Plan and
Pilgrim Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who was chief executive of Pilgrim, became CEO of the
combined organization in 1996. Since then, the company's senior
management positions were gradually taken over by executives from
Pilgrim, culminating in a layoff in November, which swept out many
Harvard managers, including Dr. Patrick Mattingly, senior vice
president for strategy, and Dr. John Ludden, a medical director.
The merger also created computer integration problems, which cost
Harvard Pilgrim significant sums to correct. Those costs were among
the reasons cited by the HMO for its 1998 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan has to own a lot of the responsibility,'' for the
losses, said Stephen Caulfield, chairman of the Chickering Group,
an insurance company in Cambridge. ``He chose to imprint the
organization with his people and his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Other health care executives give Greenberg credit for leading
one of the mostly highly regarded HMOs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't forget that Harvard Pilgrim is nationally
recognized as an outstanding HMO and that it is a formidable force
in this marketplace,'' said Ann Thornburg, a health care consultant
with PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Newsweek magazine ranked Harvard Pilgrim as the best
HMO in the country, while US News &AMP; World Report gave it four
stars, its highest rating, for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Though rumors have circulated in recent weeks regarding
Greenberg's term in office, news of his departure shook the Boston
health care world .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great surprise to me,'' said Dr. Manuel Lowenhaupt,
who was a board member of Harvard Community Health in the 1980s and
is a partner at Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad,'' said Dr. Harris Berman, chief executive of
Tufts Health Plan, the region's second-largest HMO and Harvard
Pilgrim's archrival. ``I feel very badly about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Berman said Harvard Pilgrim's losses, though
large, are symptomatic of the entire managed care industry. After
suppressing health insurance premiums for years to gain new
customers _ a practice that is part of what the industry calls an
``insurance cycle'' _ HMOs nationwide are starting to pay the
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance cycles make everybody look dumb,'' said Kenneth
Abramowitz, a health care analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
in New York. ``The board could have blamed it on the cycle, or the
people. Since it's difficult to pin the blame on some amorphous
cycle, it's easier to blame it on the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz said Harvard Pilgrim may be trading one set of
problems for another by trying to find a new CEO, given that the
field of candidates is thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is generally lacking in talent and experience,''
he said. ``I would hope that when the board makes a decision like
this, they have a lot of talent underneath to move up the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim has been searching unsuccessfully since February
for a chief operating officer, a new position for the organization.
Now the search is under way for a CEO as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Morse, a former banker with US Trust who in
1995 became the state's superintendent of financial services, said
Harvard Pilgrim has created an office of the CEO to be occupied by
six executives, including himself; Shapiro, a board member; William
Frado, general counsel; Esther Emard, senior vice president for
regional operations; Larry Gibson, senior vice president for human
resources and information technology; and Dr. Joseph Dorsey,
medical director.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST AGREE TO A PEACEKEEPING FORCE, BUT NOT ITS
COMPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ The West and Russia agreed for the first time
Thursday on the need for an international military presence in
Kosovo to keep any eventual peace, but the composition of such a
force and conditions for its deployment remained in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached here by foreign ministers from the Group
of Seven most industrialized nations and Russia marked a decisive
step away from the specter of a wider conflict over the Balkans
between Washington and Moscow. It also intensified pressure on
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, by demonstrating that
Russia is not ready to turn its back on the West to support him.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the six-week old conflict, a risk seemed to
exist that Russian fury at NATO over the bombardment might lead to
a severing of the carefully cultivated ties with the West that have
grown since the end of the Cold War a decade ago. Milosevic clearly
hoped for such a break.
</P>
<P>
   After much patient diplomacy, that risk has now receded. But
Thursday's agreement revealed enduring differences between the
Western and Russian approaches to the war and appeared unlikely to
bring a quick end to NATO's bombing campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the ministers called for the ``deployment
in Kosovo of effective international civil and security
presences,'' and the ``withdrawal from Kosovo of military, police
and paramilitary forces.''
</P>
<P>
   These demands appeared as significant for what they left out as
for what they included. Western ministers gave some ground by not
calling explicitly for NATO participation in the ``security''
force, as they did at the NATO summit meeting in Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the statement did not explicitly call for the
withdrawal from Kosovo of all Yugoslav forces, a demand backed by
the United States but opposed by Russia, which favors some form of
continued Yugoslav military presence.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who met here Thursday with German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, said the agreement was ``a significant step
forward'' because ``this is the first time that the Russians have
said publicly that they support an international security as well
as civilian force in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was meant by that security force appeared widely
divergent in the minds of American and Russian officials. Madeleine
Albright, the secretary of state, said, ``This must mean a strong
military force with NATO at its core.'' She said that NATO had not
made any concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, insisted, however,
that the force could not include NATO troops without the agreement
of Milosevic, whose blessing for Alliance troops in Kosovo will not
be easy to obtain. It was his refusal to agree to such a deployment
that precipitated the war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to Albright said that in private conversations,
Ivanov had been more conciliatory on the question of NATO troops.
``The Russians understand that without a strong NATO presence, the
ethnic Albanians refugees will not come home,'' one official said.
``They also understand that the Kosovo Liberation Army will never
disarm unless NATO is there.''
</P>
<P>
   This issue appeared likely to remain highly contentious. The
furthest Milosevic has appeared to go up to now has been in some
contemplation of acceptance of NATO troops that are not from the
countries leading the air campaign _ for example, Greece or Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But that would never be acceptable to the United States, which
wants ``NATO command and control of the mission,'' in the words of
one official. It therefore seems inevitable that NATO bombing will
continue or intensify in the forseeable future, even as diplomacy
inches forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stay with the strategy we have and continue to
aggressively support our air campaign and aggressively support any
diplomatic initiative that will secure the conditions necessary for
a lasting peace in Kosovo,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement called for the ``safe and free return of all
refugees and displaced persons,'' an agreement on ``substantial
self-government for Kosovo'' that respected the ``sovereignty and
territorial integrity'' of Yugoslavia, and the ``demilitarization''
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla group that has led the
fight for the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It added that the deployment of an international force should be
``endorsed and adopted by the United Nations.'' But while the West
backs a Security Council resolution on such a deployment as soon as
possible, it was far from clear that Russia would support it
without first gaining the consent of Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Officials said this basic difference over the timing of a U. N.
resolution, and how it could be passed, reflected a fundamental
divergence on how to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   While the western view is that a settlement might eventually be
imposed on Yugoslavia, with the presence of Milosevic or perhaps in
the aftermath of his downfall, the Russian view is that the only
possible resolution lies in an agreement with the Yugoslav
government.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow therefore seems likely to resist any Security Council
resolution that would open the way to an imposed solution. Germany,
however, favors a quick Security Council resolution under Chapter
Seven of the U.N. Charter which, unlike Chapter Six, does not
require the consent of the parties to a dispute for the approval of
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems suggest that progress may be slow. ``There is
still a lot to be done before we can consider an interruption of
the bombing,'' Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with a prolonged NATO campaign likely to make
several European governments, including the German and the Italian,
increasingly vulnerable, it appeared certain that diplomatic
efforts led by Russia's special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, would
continue, possibly with a further visit to Belgrade within the next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems are different,'' said one senior U.S. official.
``The political need in Europe is to show that diplomacy is being
pushed. At home, the whiff of diplomacy tends to make people
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Schroeder's Social Democratic Party have
begun to question the wisdom of the bombing, and his junior
coalition partner, the environmentalist Green Party, is split as it
approaches a decisive congress next week. In Italy, where ties with
Belgrade are traditionally warm, there is growing restiveness
within the center-left government over NATO's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that, in the coming weeks, diplomatic
attention would focus on the composition of any international force
that goes into Kosovo, an eventual timetable for a Serbian
withdrawal, how that timing would be linked to a pause in NATO
bombing, and using Russia to press Milosevic to climb down.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it seeks concessions from Milosevic, it is clear
that the West is also contemplating a resolution that would involve
his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said here they are giving ``a lot of help'' to
the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague, which is
investigating a possible indictment of Milosevic. ``Nobody is going
to lose any sleep if he is no longer in charge,'' one official said
of Milosevic, adding that suggestions of an erosion of his
authority included the recent placing under house arrest of several
generals in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many questions left unclear by Thursday's meeting was
the extent to which Russia has been persuaded to view Milosevic as
a central part of the Balkan problem _ Clinton on Thursday accused
the Yugoslav leader of ``the dehumanization, the delegitimization
of the Muslim people, first in Bosnia and then in Kosovo'' _ or
whether Moscow still sees him as central to any peace.

STATE STREET SELLING BANKING OPERATION TO CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Every three months for the past five years, Lawrence
Fish, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group Inc., telephoned
Marshall Carter, head of State Street Corp., asking to buy what
remained of State Street's bank.
</P>
<P>
   The persistence paid off, with State Street agreeing Thursday to
sell all of its branches and deposits and a big chunk of its
commercial loans to Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, the latest transaction to alter New England's rapidly
changing financial landscape, signals the rise of Providence-based
Citizens as a regional bank with a full menu of lending operations.
It also marks the final exit of State Street _ a giant, high-tech
securities processor and money manager that evolved from a
financial institution whose charter was approved by John Hancock in
1792 _ from traditional banking.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Citizens will buy all of Boston-based State
Street's retail bank, or four branches with $1.6 billion in
deposits, and around one-third, or $2.2 billion, of State Street's
commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition may help position Citizens more favorably before
industry regulators, who are working to decide what size bank
should be allowed to bid for assets to be divested by Fleet
Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. as a condition of their
blockbuster merger. That sale will put $13.6 billion in deposits
and 270 branches in New England, including 200 in Massachusetts, on
the market, the largest divestiture ever.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller Citizens, whose mainstay has been traditional,
slow-growth deposits rather than corporate lending, wants to buy
some of those assets. But regulators favor banks with strong
commercial lending practices _ usually larger banks _ as bidders.
By bulking up through the State Street deal, Citizens may stand a
better chance of becoming a contender.
</P>
<P>
   For Citizens, a private company owned by the Royal Bank of
Scotland, the transaction is ``a defining moment in our history and
transforms Citizens into the premier middle-market and
small-banking practice here in New England,'' Fish said Thursday.
The deal increases Citizens' commercial portfolio by nearly 50
percent to $7 billion, or one-third of its $21 billion in assets.
Around $2 billion of the total is real estate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens is paying the portfolio's book value of $1.1 billion
plus a $350 million premium, all in cash. The book value does not
include $500 million in repurchase agreement deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, part of a trend of consolidation in the banking
industry, represents State Street's final farewell from mainstream
banking. The company began two centuries ago as a traditional bank
but over the past two decades has transformed itself into the
world's third-largest securities processor _ a global back-office
operation that keeps track of what institutional investors buy and
sell. In addition to collecting fees for overseeing $5 trillion in
assets in custody, it also manages $525 billion in assets through
its State Street Global Advisers, the nation's third-largest money
management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens gains two State Street branches in Boston and two in
Quincy, as well as a loan book focused on small and mid-sized
businesses in the Northeast. The company, which now has 239
branches throughout five New England states and is the region's
second-largest bank behind Fleet-BankBoston, gains 300 State Street
employees. It pledged no cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The sale leaves State Street with $4 billion in lease financing,
and real estate and securities-backed loans to institutional
investors. While State Street will retain its banking charter, it
will close its remaining downtown branch and provide bank services
only to institutional and private clients. Traditional banking, or
retail deposits and commercial loans, accounted for only 8 percent
of State Street's bottom line last year. State Street's entire
commercial lending business had pre-tax profits last year of $88
million, according to the Royal.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a sign atop its tower that says ``State Street
Bank'' _ a fixture it cannot change under Boston architecture
regulations _ State Street is no longer a bank. ``The company sees
itself as a technology firm, as doing processing for other
customers,'' said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's
equity research group.
</P>
<P>
   While a Royal statement said the acquisition ``positions
Citizens to take strong advantage of the continuing consolidation
in the New England market,'' Citizens hastened to say the sale was
in the works months before Fleet and BankBoston's deal in March to
combine into the nation's eighth-largest bank. But Carter said at a
press conference Thursday that for Citizens, the merger was one
factor behind the timing of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Fish first approached Carter about a sale in mid-1995, when
State Street had finished shaping up a loan portfolio battered in
previous years by New England's recession. Undaunted by Carter's
response of ``maybe, but not now,'' Fish called his colleague every
quarter to see if sentiment had changed, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a Kennedy School of Government dinner last December for
the British chancellor of the exchequer, Fish found himself
strategically positioned next to Carter at the head table,
according to an executive familiar with the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both looked at each other and said, `maybe it's time we
talked','' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Several conversations followed in January and February,
culminating in a verbal agreement Sunday while Fish was golfing at
the Sawgrass Country Club in Jacksonville, Fla. A final deal was
signed early Thursday after the two sides worked through the night
to hammer out a servicing arrangement for the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Although several large national banks and some smaller local
outfits had made inquiries, Carter said he had not shopped the
assets to other buyers because he viewed Citizens as the best
option for State Street's banking customers.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens has grown rapidly this decade through acquisitions,
quintupling its deposits and commercial loans since 1992. But ``we
don't want to be a $50 or $100 billion company,'' or twice to five
times current size, Fish said Thursday. Fleet-BankBoston will have
over $160 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   London financial circles buzzed with talk Thursday that the
Royal might be more likely to sell Citizens, an attractive
franchise that contributes 25 percent of its parent's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry increasingly divided between giant banks with
hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and tiny community
players, there are not many banks of Citizens' size left.
</P>
<P>
   State Street has various ways to use the sale proceeds. ``We
have historically looked at small and sometimes not-so-small
acquisitions _ that will be one option,'' said company spokesman
Gregory Ahern. Other possibilities include reinvesting in
technology or conducting a stock buyback.
</P>
<P>
   State Street shares, on an upswing for nearly two decades, rose
3-1/16 Thursday to close at 86-9/16. They are up 23 percent so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Citizens deal, which is expected to close in the third
quarter, State Street was advised by Goldman Sachs. Citizens used J
P Morgan &AMP; Co, the Boston law firm of Goodwin Proctor &AMP; Hoar, and
PriceWaterhouse Coopers.

ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS SEARCH FOR MISSING PETS IN TORNADO RUBBLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. _ Animal welfare officials from North Texas
and across the country converged Thursday to help find pets buried
in the rubble left by Monday's killer tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were asking for chain saws to cut through debris in
search of dogs, cats and birds believed to be under mountains of
brick, glass and wallboard, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pounds of dog and cat food have been donated to feed
unclaimed pets.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency Animal Rescue, a nonprofit group based in Sacramento,
Calif., was in suburban Moore, where 55 dogs had been rescued by
Thursday, said the group's director, Terri Crist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no count on the dead ones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Locating cats is an entirely different beast, Crisp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so frightened,'' Crisp said. ``They are staying
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, humane traps were being put out for the felines.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 35 will work through Tuesday to help Moore animal
control officials. The California group works only disasters,
handling eight last year.
</P>
<P>
   Suzi Green, a nurse at the Equi-Center Veterinary Hospital in
Oklahoma City, estimated Thursday that hundreds of horses had been
killed, based on reports that she was getting from owners.
</P>
<P>
   The vet hospital had about 30 injured horses, she said,
including 19 from Tinker Air Force Base, where a barn was leveled
and two other horses were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarian Mike Wiley had blisters on his hands after working
20 hours straight _ from Monday night until Tuesday afternoon _ to
stitch up lacerations from flying debris, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't hardly bend his fingers,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas near Newcastle, a community south of Oklahoma
City, veterinarian Kim Murdoch treated a herd of 60 injured cattle,
some with lacerations as large as footballs, she said. She had to
destroy 12 animals that had broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   She had no estimate of how many cattle were killed in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs of Del City and Midwest City are getting assistance
from Oklahoma City's Animal Welfare division.
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers from the North Texas communities of
Grapevine, North Richland Hills, Fort Worth and DeSoto arrived or
were en route to Oklahoma City on Thursday. Workers also came from
the McKinney and Dallas offices of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States'
Southwest Regional Office.
</P>
<P>
   Others have come from Colorado, California and Arkansas,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis White, director of the Humane Society's southwest office
in Dallas, drove past one of the worst hit areas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a Hiroshima bomb,'' he said. ``I think they're
going to find a lot of dead animals who were crushed by houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the surviving dogs and cats have been reunited with
their owners, said Dr. George Cooper, superintendent of the animal
welfare division. By Wednesday, 14 of 42 animals had been picked
up.
</P>
<P>
   In the storm's immediate aftermath, pet dogs growled at rescue
dogs searching the debris for dead and injured people, said Carla
Gathright, a Norman animal control officer.
</P>
<P>
   She rescued one cocker spaniel that she couldn't believe was
still alive. The dog was upside down in a hole next to where a
wooden light pole had broken in two. The dog's head was in muddy
water from the rainfall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to smash the dirt away from her to get enough room to
pull her out,'' Gathright said. ``You could hear the gurgling of
mud as she fought for air.''
</P>
<P>
   In one garage, an animal control officer found a small dog
inside the wheel well of a car that was about 5 inches off the
floor, all its tires flattened, Gathright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very traumatized,'' Gathright said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newcastle, a 1-year-old Australian shepherd got a new name
after the twister. Buddy is now called Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The dog's owner, Lee Kuhlman, 31, said his cousin had been
keeping the dog at his home in Newcastle. Monday morning, Buddy had
been chained as usual to a steel fence post moored in concrete.
After the tornado swept through Monday evening, all the homes
around the cousin's house were destroyed and the dog was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kuhlman returned to the house Tuesday to help clean up,
a neighbor down the street had good news. He had found Buddy alive,
still on the chain. Kuhlman promptly renamed him Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear to you this dog had to have been blowing in the
wind,'' Kuhlman marveled. ``It just blows my mind.''

STORM DESTROYS HOME _ EXCEPT FOR BUILT-IN SHELTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL CITY, Okla. _ When light began peeking underneath her
bedroom closet door Monday evening, Beth Bartlett knew her house
was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled among her clothes in a space specially constructed to
serve as a closet and in-home storm shelter, Bartlett could
ascertain what the tornado was doing to her Del City neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a loud roar, but you could hear things crashing into
one another and debris just kept pummeling the house,'' Bartlett
said on Thursday. ``You could tell the house was taking a pounding.
Then I saw the light under the door and I knew. ... I knew the
house was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the bombed-out conditions that greeted her when she
emerged from her shelter, Bartlett, 40, was elated to have
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Without the 12-inch-thick concrete walls and added supports to
make the closet shelter even stronger, Bartlett and her mother,
Norma Bartlett, likely would have been injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have that closet to hide in, I don't think we
would have made it,'' said Norma Bartlett, 64. ``Our old hiding
place was the hallway closet and everything from one of the
bedrooms got sucked right in there. We would have been beaten to
death with debris.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bartlett had constructed the in-house shelter because
of a lifelong fear of tornadoes, her decision made her an unlikely
guinea pig for severe weather researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the shell of her home on Thursday, Texas Tech University
researchers were trumpeting her shelter as proof that tornadoes
need not be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that even the most powerful of tornadoes are
survivable,'' said Larry Tanner, an architect and structural
engineer with Texas Tech's wind engineering program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, even those on a moderate income, can have a shelter
in their home where they can ride out a tornado. It's simple and
not that expensive to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett purchased the family home of 35 years from her mother
after they decided to become roommates. It sits in a Del City
neighborhood decimated by the storm, just two blocks from the
western edge of Tinker Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bartlett's shelter was rolled into her remodeling
project, she isn't sure of its exact cost, but Tanner estimates it
would cost between $3,000 and $5,000 to build a similar one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a do-it-yourselfer, you can do one like this for
$2,500,'' Tanner said. ``If you hire someone to do it for you, your
costs are probably going to double. But for someone building a new
home, the costs would be considerably less if it was done at the
time of construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech, which has pamphlets on constructing
tornado-resistant shelters inside homes, has been bombarded with
thousands of calls after Monday's tornado. Somewhat surprisingly,
Tanner said they are finding few Oklahoma City residences with any
kind of storm shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Three Texas Tech teams are in the Oklahoma City area to assess
the damage and learn more about the manner in which buildings are
destroyed by tornadoes. Besides homes, they are studying how
commercial structures withstood the storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see on the Bartlett's home how a piece of a lumber
became a missile and tore into the roof,'' Tanner said. ``What
happens is a tornado destroys your neighbor's house and then it
becomes a weapon against your home. And once that debris breaks
through or tears off the roof, the structural integrity is gone and
you will probably lose your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Bartlett's shelter survived, the house was in
shambles. She said she will rebuild, with an improved shelter being
the most important part of the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been told I need three dead-bolts on the door
instead of one, so that's one improvement I'll make,'' Bartlett
said. ``And that will make Mom feel better. She's was convinced the
door wasn't going to make it through the storm, but it did and we
did. And we'll rebuild right here, where we belong.''

BUSH ALREADY EXPLORING A UNITED AGENDA WITH HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders are so united behind Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas for their party's presidential nomination
that they have already begun meeting informally to discuss a common
agenda for Bush and House candidates in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   These meetings are the latest demonstration of the extraordinary
degree to which the party apparatus has concluded that Bush's
nomination is inevitable even though there are nearly a dozen
contenders, the governor has not formally announced his candidacy
and the first primary votes will not be cast for nine months. The
outpouring is all the more striking because members of Congress
traditionally prefer backing one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the nation's governors have already rallied to
Bush's side, and he enjoys many other institutional advantages,
including the early backing of more than a third of the Senate
Republicans as well as the behind-the-scenes encouragement from
fund-raising officials of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's support is so vast that his endorsements rival those of
Vice President Al Gore on the Democratic side. That is remarkable
given that Gore has only one opponent and has been the presumed
Democratic nominee to succeed President Clinton since their
election in 1992 _ two years before Bush was even elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of the groundswell for Bush is in the
House, where the top leaders are already backing the governor.
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois had agreed to be the Bush
campaign's chief House liaison, but he stepped aside when he rose
to the speakership. He is officially neutral only because of his
position.
</P>
<P>
   The second- and third-ranking House Republicans, each from
Texas, Dick Armey and Tom Delay, also back Bush. The chairman of
the House Republican conference, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, is a
member of Bush's exploratory committee, as is Rep. Roy Blunt of
Missouri, the chief deputy whip. In all, 94 House Republicans have
signed with Bush, including more than half the committee chairs.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders view Bush's nomination as so inevitable that they
recently began the informal meetings with him as well as his
advisers, including Karl Rove, his top strategist, to discuss a
unified agenda on issues ranging from Social Security to taxes to
education. They have also begun to discuss joint electoral and
fund-raising strategies for the 2000 campaign. The meetings were
first reported Thursday in Roll Call, a newspaper that circulates
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians involved in the sessions cautioned that they were
preliminary and were geared to announcing a common agenda at the
end of the primary season _ not for imminent policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes, as I believe, there's a great opportunity for us
to come together around a common set of principles,'' Armey said in
an interview. ``We'll work out the details through the basic
legislative process. You will probably see a final distillation of
all these ideas in a set of programatic objectives that would not
be announced formally until after he's the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said the participants were far from reaching specifics. On
Social Security, for instance, he said, there was only ``the sense
that this is something we'll want to address together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a member of Bush's exploratory
committee, said he has rounded up 20 senators to back the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell explained that there was ``a natural coalescing of
thinking'' between lawmakers and Bush. ``Where we think an issue is
developing, obviously, I'd be on the phone talking to him about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this budding alliance may say more about a
transformation among House Republicans than about Bush: It
underscores a reality that lawmakers of all stripes are so eager to
find a leader _ and to retake the White House _ that they are
willing to back a politician who is untested on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   That many of the most conservative members of Congress are
backing Bush may also reflect a triumph of pragmatism there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taming them and domesticating them from going on further
kamikaze missions like impeachment,'' said a supporter of Bush who
also works closely with House Republicans. ``I've got several
clients in the House who have gone down and met with Bush and said,
`I'm tired of being viewed as an extension of Trent Lott and Newt
Gingrich.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The overwhelming congressional backing could help Bush navigate
the minefield of national issues. And the support of many of the
most conservative members could also provide Bush cover so he can
espouse nuanced views on matters like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   So many House members are jumping on the Bush bandwagon because
he is so far ahead in the polls that they see him as inevitable.
Many lawmakers said they were also drawn to him because he comes
from a big state, has impressive political skills and has
successfully pulled in votes from Democrats and independents as
well as from Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians like nothing better than jumping in front of a
parade,'' said Ed Brookover, a strategist who is close to many
House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In backing Bush, members of Congress are passing over their own
colleagues in the race: Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Smith
of New Hampshire, and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, particularly Bush's rivals, warn that that the
Bush juggernaut amounts to short-sighed foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   One top strategist to a Bush opponent, who agreed to speak only
on the condition of anonymity, put it this way: ``They're
panic-stricken on Capitol Hill, and they're afraid they're going to
lose their five-seat majority. And they're looking for a savior.
But in trying to preclude a contest from taking place before it's
even started, they're putting an awful lot of eggs in the basket
for a candidate they know absolutely nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said the discussions
demonstrate the governor's commitment to developing ``a positive,
issue-oriented agenda.'' ``These discussions are about the agenda
that would emerge from the 2000 presidential campaign should
Governor Bush be elected president,'' Ms. Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party who
is a member of Bush's exploratory committee, said the early support
``should not be misread into thinking he's going to get the
nomination on a silver platter: he's not.''

FOR SURVIVORS, FAITH MAY BE ALL THEY HAVE LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Tornadoes wiped out entire neighborhoods. One
left a man comatose after it lifted his wife into thin air right
before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Another left a child fighting for his life after a board became
embedded in his body like some sick supernatural prank.
</P>
<P>
   The merciless pack of tornadoes that trampled Oklahoma on Monday
claimed dozens of lives and destroyed some 3,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the destruction, painful and unanswerable
questions linger: Why did this happen here? Why my child? Why my
church? Why not me? And how could a merciful God allow it to
happen?
</P>
<P>
   Ministers, counselors and others are answering such questions
daily from Oklahomans who have endured two devastating tragedies in
four years, the first being the Murrah Federal Building bombing.
They were repeatedly addressed on Thursday during National Day of
Prayer events across the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I sit down I just want to cry,'' said Christine
Grigsby, who was left with only the clothes on her back. ``Why us?
Why would God let this happen to us? ... I felt hurt by it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Some storm victims weren't blaming God. But they believe that
they have been treated unfairly by the natural calamity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd actually have to point the blame toward Mother Nature,''
said Karim Hayavi of Moore as he gathered deodorant, toothpaste and
a pack of underwear from a makeshift shelter. ``There isn't anyone
else to blame. I just want to know why these miserable things keep
happening every four years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Missions pastor Bud Parrish of First Baptist Church of Moore
said, ``In the anger and the pain, you can still find trust in
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Heath, a licensed psychologist, was spared the tornadoes'
powerful wallops. His son lost his home.
</P>
<P>
   He said he can best describe the tornado victims as ``the
walking wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, many people are still in shock,'' said Heath, who
is vice president of the Oklahoma City Murrah Building Survivors
Association. ``During the first period of grief, your mind and soul
are not ready to accept what has happened. They become numb and
behave as if it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the shock wears off, others express grief and anger and want
someone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Heath said his faith in God remained solid after the April 19,
1995, bombing that killed 168 people. Caught on the fifth floor
during the explosion, he found himself staring down the bomb's
roaring pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and saw one of my friends holding his left eye in
his left hand,'' Heath said. ``It was at that point I started
bargaining with God and asked him to let me get out of this
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Killensworth, 34, of Moore, said her home exploded into
kindling during Monday's storm. She said her faith will carry her
through the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Only an act of God, she said, kept her family alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all couldn't fit in the bathroom,'' said Killensworth, a
mother of four. ``My husband flipped over the sofa and love seat
and we hid with some of the kids under there.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the windows shattered, the roof flew off and the
winds roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tornado started lifting the love seat up into the air,''
she said. ``At first I was hanging onto it and then I let go so I
could grab hold of my babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating said he has witnessed those of
various faiths lock hands to help those who need it most. The
governor, a devout Catholic, said he believes it is not God's will
that anyone suffers.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said he believes that the Lord's presence shines through
the community's ``barn-raising mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after the bombing, Keating said, a firefighter from
Maryland returned to the area after rescuing survivors from the
federal building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was mowing the lawn and something told him to come
back here,'' the governor said. ``He said, `I have never felt more
spiritual and more alive as a human being as when I was here in
this community. I had to come back.' ''

   HONG KONG _ In 10 years, this city will be a miserably
overcrowded and polluted place, burdened with double-digit
unemployment and astronomical public spending, if 1.67 million
mainland Chinese are allowed to emigrate, government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers would be forced to spend $92 billion on new
construction, land and transportation infrastructure for five new
cities, 266 extra schools and a half-million added public housing
apartments, if the government abides by a local high court ruling
granting residency to all mainland-born children of Hong Kong
residents, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   Social service advocates and politicians have accused officials
of exaggerating the numbers and of creating an absurd scenario to
scare the public into demanding that Beijing intervene to stem the
predicted tide of arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars have warned that asking Beijing to override Hong
Kong's high court, or to amend the local constitution to limit
residency rights here, could be a dangerous step toward eroding
Hong Kong's judicial independence and autonomy from China, which
regained control of the British colony in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong cannot bear the burden of an additional 1.67 million
people,'' said the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa says. ``The
consequences are unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that by 2009, more than $4 billion would have to
be spent annually on housing, education, training, health care,
welfare and transport for migrants. Perhaps an even greater
constraint is the 14,826 acres of land needed for new facilities
and infrastructure, the report said. In the 1990s, an average of
just 494 acres a year were made available for development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining solution,'' Tung told legislators, ``is that we
ask the National People's Congress to amend the Basic Law, or for
the NPC standing committee to give an interpretation'' of a local
high court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In January Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled that the
Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution, grants residency
rights to all children of Hong Kong residents, even illegitimate
ones and ones born before their parents became residents. Last
week, the government said 1.67 million people would eligible for
residency within 13 years under the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many have questioned the figures. The numbers imply
that one of four Hong Kong men has out-of-wedlock children in
China, and that mainland mothers are widely flouting China's
one-child policy. High numbers of mainland children born to Hong
Kong parents also contradict Hong Kong's low birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics lambasted the government for not reporting last week
that 20 percent of people surveyed had said they did not want their
mainland-born children to move here, or did not expect them to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China still restricts exit permits for its citizens,
so there is no reason to believe that all eligible people would be
able to come to Hong Kong soon _ even if Hong Kong wanted to accept
them. At present, 150 mainlanders settle here every day under a
quota agreed to by Hong Kong and mainland authorities. And there is
no sign that Beijing will start issuing 1,000 exit permits a day _
the number needed to fulfill Hong Kong's dire predictions about an
influx.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics worry the immigration issue is a Trojan Horse
that will persuade the public to invite China's interference _ and
thereby undermine Hong Kong's autonomy on everything from civil
rights to economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we ask the central authorities to trust Hong Kong to
solve it ourselves?'' Democratic Party legislator Albert Ho asked
Tung. ``Hong Kong people have been scared...so they will agree to
whatever you propose.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not our tactic,'' Tung replied. ``But if you have a
better solution, I am more than happy to hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the government meant to scare people, it has done
so.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu Wai-ming, 39, a construction worker who admitted his own
parents came here from China, said: ``I'm not well-educated, but I
know it'll be a burden and may affect social order. The best
solution is to overrule the court's decision. If we can't do that,
then let them come in gradually, in 10- to 20-year increments. It's
like rain _ if every day there's a small amount, it's OK. But if
one day it rains too much, you have a flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates about the impact of new arrivals appeared
contradictory or were such worst-case scenarios that they strained
credulity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government said new migrants would add 876,500
people to the labor force, lowering wages and per capita income and
increasing unemployment by 10 percentage points in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants' advocates said that in fact, countless jobs would be
created by the government's predicted building boom.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary for Security Regina Ip denied a report that that the
government had ``cooked up or inflated'' figures, saying it had a
duty to tell residents what would happen if every eligible migrant
were to come. Already, Ip said, 45,000 children of Hong Kong
residents have arrived since Hong Kong returned to China in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Yau, 23, a graduate student in social sciences, said she
thinks the ``government is playing tricks with numbers. Quite a
large number don't want to come, because they already have families
there or because life wouldn't be as good for them here if they're
unemployed. Yet the government's trick is very effective, because I
know a lot about this issue, and even I am scared.''

SOMETIMES A PICTURE IS JUST A PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Why Are Our Pictures Puzzles?'' (Routledge; $80)  &UR; James &LR; 
 &UR; Elkins &LR;  writes about art historians' tendency to over- &LR; analyze
great works. Some examples of this tendency, cited in an essay
about the book in Lingua Franca magazine:
</P>
<P>
   Renoir's 1875 painting ``Woman at the Piano,'' according to
Norwegian art historian  &UR; Birger Carlstrom &LR; , is an allegory
revealing the painter's worries about the Panama Canal, which was
just getting under way. In one murky corner of the work _ which
depicts a romantic-looking woman seating on a bench and tickling
the ivories _ a ``brownish squiggle'' is said to evoke the Latin
American isthmus. The painting, says the Norwegian, was meant to be
a prophesy of financial problems about to beset many French
investors.
</P>
<P>
   German scholar  &UR; Bernhard Koerner &LR; , analyzing  &UR; Rembrandt &LR; 's
``Rape of Ganymede,'' thinks that an infant's squiggly stream of
urine is meant to be a heraldic fertility symbol.  &UR; Sidney Geist &LR; 
says that a Cezanne landscape, ``Small Houses at Anvers,'' is
really a Freudian depiction in which the hills duplicate the
contours of the genitalia of a hermaphrodite.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins also discusses  &UR; Frank Meshberger &LR; 's 1990 analysis of
 &UR; Michelangelo &LR; 's Sistine Chapel ceiling, in which the drapery behind
the figure of God in the panel depicting Adam's creation are
representative of an outline of the human brain. Meshberger says
that the leg of one of the angels behind God ``represents the
pituitary stalk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pictures are effectively and forever without meaning,'' writes
Elkins. ``Art history is the bruise that has grown up around that
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MATERIAL GOODS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Can anyone get a bargain at Chanel? The New York Observer says
the couturier has twice-yearly sales, by invitation only, followed
by one-week 40 percent sales open to the public, then
employees-only sales, even more reduced. Finally, whatever is left
is destroyed so it won't wind up in a discount store. ``We do shred
the merchandise,'' said Chanel Vice President  &UR; Barbara &LR; 
 &UR; Cirkva &LR; , ``so that it does not fall into strange channels of
distribution. That is a tradition here.'' The buttons are the only
things saved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: That auction of left-behind stuff at  &UR; Burt &LR; 
 &UR; Reynolds &LR; ' former dinner theater in Florida netted some fancy
prices. A picture of Burt and &UR; Loni  &LR; fetched $10; Burt and  &UR; Groucho &LR; 
 &UR; Marx &LR; , $20; Burt and the pope, $50.
</P>
<P>
   _ World Championship Wrestling has licensed Perfumania to sell
WCW Nitro, a men's perfume. ``It will be upscale,'' Perfumania's
 &UR; Ilia Lekach  &LR; told the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gazoontite (that's gesundheit in the correct German), a Union
Street store for allergy sufferers and asthmatics, had a
grand-opening party last  &LR; Sunday night. Inside the store: ``all
kinds of things to help people to breathe happier and healthier.''
Outside on the sidewalk:  &UR; Greg Chew &LR;  and at least one other
customer, smoking.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the latest issue of the airline magazine Ambassador,
 &UR; Marty Olmstead  &LR; asked a number of hotel concierges about odd
requests they had received. One with a particular local flavor: The
Hotel Nikko in San Francisco was asked to ``deliver a traditional
Chinese dress, embroidered with a golden dragon, large enough to
fit a 6-foot-2 man.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sophie Rhys-Jones  &LR; and &UR; Edward Windsor &LR;  have registered at the
London china shop Thomas Goode, reports the Weekend Financial Times
of London, where there's an aura of danger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, says that newspaper,  &UR; Czar Nicholas II  &LR; placed an order
with Goode to replace dishes broken in a set first ordered in 1776.
A few years later, he was assassinated. In recent years, after
 &UR; Gianni Versace &LR;  ordered a plate in the same style, he was
assassinated, too. The Financial Times says it ``hopes that
Rhys-Jones and her fiance will exercise extreme caution when
selecting the pattern of their dinner service.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The British Design Council, preparing for a millennium
demonstration of the ``latest examples of British brilliance in
innovation and creativity,'' has selected more than 600 products
and services to be exhibited, says the Wall Street Journal. Among
them: Viagra, largely developed in British laboratories; the
Teletubbies; and water beds for dairy cows, ``which provide
unsurpassed comfort.''

COMMENTARY: THE ROGUES' GALLERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine what it would sound like if the world's biggest rogues _
North Korea's Kim Jong Il, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Yugoslavia's
Slobodan Milosevic and Syria's Hafez al-Assad _ had a conference
call about Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kim: Is everybody on the line?
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: Kim, how are you _ you old Scud-maker you!
</P>
<P>
   Kim: Actually, that's what I was calling about. I just saw this
report that the Americans had run out of air-launched cruise
missiles. Turns out they stopped the production line back in '95.
Can you believe that? I have more Scuds than they have cruise
missiles. Heck, Saddam, you still have more Scuds buried in the
desert than they have cruise missiles. Anyway, I was thinking about
launching another missile test over Japan right now, or maybe a
probe across the 38th parallel. My people are starving, and every
time I rattle my cage the Americans send me more potatoes. Maybe
Iraq could take a bite out of Kuwait at the same time and we could
``triangulate'' Bill Clinton. Boy, would that bring the potatoes!
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: I love it! The last Pentagon strategic review said the
U.S. could fight two wars at once _ one on the Korean Peninsula and
one in the gulf _ but it looks to me like they can barely handle
one, let alone three.
</P>
<P>
   Kim: Can I put you all on hold? I've got a call coming in from
Li Peng in China. (Long pause) I'm back. You're gonna love this. Li
is thinking this might be China's moment to seize Taiwan, but he
says Zhu Rongji and Jiang Zemin are opposed. Those two are such
lackeys. They just want to kiss up to the Americans to get into the
World Trade Organization. I've been having trouble with those two
myself. They keep me on a short leash. Does Clinton realize how
much he needs China to keep Asia quiet right now? The Americans
probably hope we haven't noticed that they moved their only
aircraft carrier in North Asia _ the Roosevelt _ over to the coast
of Yugoslavia. But we notice everything.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam: The Americans think that nothing is connected and that
the world stands still for them. I have a question for brother
Slobodan, though: What's it like fighting 19 countries at once? I
thought I had the record.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan: Rope-a-dope, that's my strategy, rope-a-dope. Whatever
you do, don't turn on your anti-aircraft radars. That was your
mistake, brother Saddam. Every time you turned on your radar they
sent a radiation-seeking missile right back down the radar beam and
blew you away. You're still doing it, you idiot. NATO pilots never
know when I might turn my radar on, so they won't fly below 15,000
feet. They fight like they're Northwest Airlines. And always
remember the Jesse Jackson rule: If you can capture just one U.S.
pilot, Jackson will pay you a visit within 30 days and shift the
whole U.S. focus from its strategic war aims to POWs. As soon as
Jackson starts mediating, people forget what the war is about and
put you on the same moral plane with the U.S. president. Then
you're home free. Right, brother Hafez?
</P>
<P>
   Hafez: You're all idiots.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan, Kim, Saddam: What?
</P>
<P>
   Hafez: How many times have I told you all _ being an extremist
is not just knowing when to go over the line, but when to duck back
behind it. Sure, I leveled a whole town, Hama, when the Muslims
there threatened me. But then I rebuilt it. Sure, I'm bleeding the
Israelis in Lebanon, but I stop just before they get frustrated
enough to bomb me. Saddam, you mistook the world's tolerance for
your war against Iran for a green light to invade Kuwait. Slobo,
you mistook the world's tolerance for your war in Bosnia for a
green light to ethnically cleanse Kosovo. You're both fighting as
though the Soviet Union were going to resupply us all again. It's
not. The Russians want cash now. All Primakov ever says to me is
``Show me the money.'' Look where the Russians agreed to be part of
the international peace force in Kosovo. It was at this week's G-8
economic meeting! It's all part of a package deal for them.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you guys are going to win, all right. But win what? Without
a deal with the West you'll never be able to rebuild your
countries, and you personally will be on the run forever. Your
people may hate the Americans now, but as time goes by they will
hate you more, and you'll be lucky if you don't live to see it. All
you're winning is the right to sleep in a different bed every night
for the rest of your lives. Thanks, but I like to sleep at home.

CLINTON, SCHROEDER MEET WITH KOSOVO REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGELHEIM, Germany _ They lie on black metal bunk beds, eight to
a room, but they do not sleep. They are safe now, but night after
night these refugees from Kosovo relive the horrors of their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday they recounted their stories to a special audience that
included President Clinton, who pledged, ``You will go home
again,'' in a message meant as much for President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia as for these refugees created by his
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany sat silenced
for the most part as the misery of the uprooted refugees washed
over them.
</P>
<P>
   But in a final speech to more than 300 of the refugees here,
Clinton assured them: ``You have not been forgotten or abandoned.
Milosevic has not succeeded in erasing your identity from the pages
of history, and he will not succeed in erasing your presence from
the land of your parents and grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   These refugees said they were beaten and robbed and their homes
set on fire. They saw people massacred, their legs cut off. Women
said they smeared mud on their faces to make themselves as
unattractive as possible _ to discourage the Serbs from raping
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left my brother in the basement and he had no food,'' said
one woman. Another paid a huge bribe to the Serb police to get her
father out. ``It's 42 days,'' she said, ``and I don't know what has
happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been that long since they were chased from their villages
in Kosovo by Yugoslav forces, and nearly a month since 334 of them
were airlifted here from a vast tent encampment to which they had
fled in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   They make up a fraction of the 10,000 refugees Germany is
sheltering now, even as it plans to take in 10,000 more. Germany is
one of 19 countries giving safe haven to more than 25,000 refugees
of the forced displacement from Kosovo. The United States announced
two weeks ago that it would take in an additional 20,000, with 453
of them arriving in New Jersey on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Schroeder told the refugees that repeating their
stories would be therapeutic for the storytellers and it would
underscore to the outside world why it was necessary to bring the
weight of the strongest military alliance in history to bear
against the small Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``People find what has happened to you to be literally almost
unbelievable,'' Clinton told two dozen refugees, who sat with him
and Schroeder in a small hallway for nearly an hour and a half
Thursday morning after they met with one family in the room it now
calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the world needs to know the truth of Kosovo,'' Clinton
said. ``And we need to make sure that we are all strong enough to
stay with you and to support you until you can go home.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The stories came in a flood. One man, probably in his early 20s,
told them: ``I'm young, but my life is broken from what I've seen
in Blace. The first day I arrived I heard that 24 children,
infants, had died in the camp, of exposure, of starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman told of being herded out by Serb police who demanded
5,000 German marks from her, then 1,000. ``I had a golden chain, a
necklace,'' she said, ``and I said, `That's all I have.' And they
said, `We are full of gold; we just want cash now.'''
</P>
<P>
   They also said they appreciated the visit, thanking Schroeder
profusely for opening Germany's doors to them, and lauding Clinton
for pressing their cause.
</P>
<P>
   One refugee called the war just and the leaders noble. Clinton
promised to help track down their missing friends and family and to
establish a registry in the camps and computer terminals here so
they can stay in communication with others and keep up to the
minute on the war.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Clinton told them not to lose heart. ``Don't let
yourself be broken by this,'' he said. ``Find a way to be glad that
the sun comes up in the morning and that you have the people around
you you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's pledge that the refugees will go home again,
which is as much an aid mission as a military goal, has become a
touchstone of administration comments on the brutality in Kosovo.
Vice President Al Gore, in a speech at Ellis Island on April 21,
said the air war would not stop until Milosevic ``allows the
refugees to return and accepts an international security force to
protect all Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted some of the first Kosovo Albanian
refugees to arrive in the U.S. on Wednesday at Ft. Dix, N.J. ``We
will not let Milosevic succeed in keeping you out of your homes,''
she said. ``We will continue to work to create a peaceful Kosovo
where you can return home as soon as possible and build your
country again.''

COMMENTARY: 100 BRAVE ARABS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Palestinian state will be created. It will be a dictatorship
_ ranging from stifling to murderous, and most of the time both.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world's governments, including the United States, will not
worry about that. They never really thought Arabs were entitled to
human liberty in their own nations. Neither did Arabs; only a few
spoke or risked themselves for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The questions remaining about the official creation of Palestine
are time and what security conditions the Israelis will squeeze out
to slow down its military growth.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Labor government unofficially created Palestine at
Oslo. The United Nations, vastly distasteful of Israel, will make
sure it becomes official. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is re-elected, Palestine
will come about somewhat later, as he insists on strong security
conditions. If Ehud Barak wins, he will be spurred on by Washington
and Western Europe, which back him, not to be security-finicky, but
he will not be their patsy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dictatorial nature of Palestine's government is predictable
because of history, past and present. Arabs never produced a
democratic society nor world Islam a liberalizing movement of
moment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month about 100 Arabs from 15 countries did meet, at great
danger to themselves, to send a cry of Arab rights _ to the world,
which eagerly avoided it, and to their own people, those who
somehow get word past censorship and police. Morocco was the only
Mideast country that would allow them to meet and in which they
felt relatively safe from Arab spies shadowing them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final statement of the conference included the usual Arab
demonization of Israel _ racist, Zionist, imperialist Israel. Only
a few Arab intellectuals ever are courageous enough to skip that.
But if a man risks one hand for democracy, I suppose you cannot
blame him for not sticking the other in the fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, the statement deals bravely with the ``grim'' truth
that even whatever scraps of liberties Arabs did hold are
declining. Saudi Arabia and some gulf states, it says, lack even
the symbols of democracy _ no constitution, parliament or modern
legal system. Why bother? Countries that had made progress are
pedaling back _ Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan. In Iraq, Syria,
Sudan, Bahrain: ``massive and dangerous human rights violations.''
Only Morocco got some praise for a ``relative improvement'' this
past decade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The statement attacked armed Muslim groups for physical and
intellectual terrorism. Searing the hand deeper, the signers
denounced regimes that used ``Islam's specificity'' as an excuse to
reject reform _ an attack on fundamentalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it because of religion that Islam has so miserably failed to
create democracy and tolerate human rights? Maybe, but Catholicism,
Orthodox Christianity, Judaism and particularly Protestantism often
overcame the bigotries and calls for eyeball-plucking in their own
religious histories. They produced democracies by the score.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the reason is in social history as well as religious _
Islamic disdain for rule by majority decisions. Perhaps it is the
absence of the ``legal person'' the West inherited from Roman law _
local governments, colleges, societies, corporations that run their
affairs and can be held responsible, subject to suit.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's borrowed knowledge. But I know all by myself that one
Mideast democracy exists, and would seem to be something to be
cherished by the others. I remain astonished and disgusted that
whenever something happens in Israel not to their liking, European
democracies threaten to cut it back to borders that guarantee its
death. American journalists who proclaim love for Israel screech
that its ethic, morality and legal system are collapsing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I try to explain why I am so troubled about that incessant
denigration of Israel's democracy _ or America's. Prof. Ruth Wisse
of Harvard, at a dinner for that intellectually indispensable
magazine Commentary, found the words in what Jean-Francois Revel
wrote 16 years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Exaggerated self-criticism would be a harmless luxury of
civilization if there were no enemy at the gate. ... But if it is
repeated often enough, it is finally believed. Where will the
citizens of democratic societies find reasons to resist the enemy
outside if they are persuaded from childhood that their
civilization is merely an accumulation of failures, and a monstrous
imposture?''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO said Thursday that its bombing had
destroyed half the Yugoslav army's ammunition stores in Kosovo and
200 tanks and other armored vehicles, artillery pieces, and trucks
_ about 20 percent of all Yugoslav heavy equipment in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a spokesman for the allied military
command, predicted that as bombing intensified and the weather
improved, 50 percent of the armored personnel carriers, long-range
guns and other heavy weaponry the 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers, police
and paramilitaries in Kosovo need to continue operations against
ethnic Albanian civilians there would soon be knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission,'' Jertz said, ``is to pin them down, cut them
off, and take them out. We have pinned them down, we have pretty
much largely cut them off, and we are about to take them out.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials admitted the bombing campaign had failed to stop
the Yugoslav forces in Kosovo from driving most of the 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians in the province out of their homes. But Thursday,
presenting the most comprehensive picture yet of the effects of 43
days of allied air strikes, NATO officials promised that their
attacks would intensify until those forces were destroyed and
international peacekeepers could take hundreds of thousands of
refugees back in.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to dispel the impression that six full weeks of allied
bombing had had no effect at all on the Yugoslav forces that have
driven more than a million people from their homes in Kosovo since
the NATO bombing began March 24, allied officials said that the
bombing would continue until the Yugoslavs were forced to let them
all return in safety, under the protection of an international
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have adapted our tactics to take advantage of a wide
variety of intelligence gathering facilities,'' Jertz said. With
more than 1,000 planes available for air strikes, he said, ``We
have planes circling waiting to respond to targets of opportunity
designated by forward air controllers.''

NATO MUST BE PART OF PEACEKEEPING FORCE, KOSOVAR LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova said Thursday
that NATO must be included in any international force sent to
secure the return of ethnic Albanian refugees to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking softly in French at a news conference in Rome, Rugova,
in his first public remarks since he left Kosovo on Wednesday, said
that ``an international force, NATO and other countries, is a key
condition for the return of the refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova gave almost no details about his circumstances over the
last six weeks in Yugoslavia, where he had been shown on television
meeting with President Slobodan Milosevic and making conciliatory
statements, prompting NATO leaders to suggest that he was being
coerced. He said he had arrived in Italy to ``rebuild the political
life of our country.'' Rugova added that the withdrawal of Yugoslav
forces and an international presence were ``essential'' to any
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate political leader who describes himself as a pacifist
and who accepted the agreement at Rambouillet, France, Rugova said
his views had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the last 10 years seeking peace and trying to avoid
that Kosovo end up the way it is right now,'' he said. He added
that he would continue to push for a non-violent solution so that
ethnic Albanians and the Serb civilian minority in Kosovo could
``build a future.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful that the Yugoslav authorities would be closely
watching his statements in the West, Rugova did not address the
conditions of his stay in Kosovo, which some have described as
house arrest, or his current views of the bombing campaign. Instead
he suggested that he had remained there to work on a negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my stay in Kosovo I had contacts with the Serbian
authorities,'' he said. ``We discussed a process for continuing a
political process and creating a climate of trust between us. I
sought steps for a peaceful political future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova said he had left Kosovo because he needed to confer with
colleagues who are in exile in Albania and Western Europe. ``I do
not like being in exile, and neither do my people, I am here for
them and to see that an international force in Kosovo can create a
real society in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said
that Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had phoned Rugova to invite him
to London and ``welcome him back to the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla force
fighting for independence, have been increasingly critical of
Rugova, whom they say they have replaced as the legitimate voice of
ethnic Albanians. But Rugova insisted that ``I am the elected
representative of the people of Kosovo, and I still represent the
people of Kosovo.''

   Brief looks at some of those killed in the Oklahoma tornadoes:
</P>
<P>
   Jake Self, 86, Del City
</P>
<P>
   Self was a retired minister who came to the profession late in
life, his son, Phil, said. Known in his later years simply as
``Brother Jake,'' Self grew up in Oklahoma, farming, ranching and
working as an oilman until he had a born-again experience at age
40.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the second half of his life as a Baptist minister, his
son said.
</P>
<P>
   Self died in his house on Darla Drive after a tornado lifted a
van onto the bathroom where he had sought shelter.
Jeffery Yonnes Jr., 4 months, Midwest City
</P>
<P>
   ``J.R.'' was a ``little blond, blue-eyed chubby guy,'' said his
grandfather, John Richmond. He was a good baby who would just lay
there and smile at whomever passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just starting to laugh out loud at you if you tickled
him,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. was thrown out of the bathtub after his home on Will Rogers
Road split apart. He was found dead in a neighbor's yard.
Bonnie Price, 46, Bethany
</P>
<P>
   Price was a nurse who loved working with the elderly, whether it
was caring for residents of three nursing home centers in nearby
Kingfisher, Okla., or for her widowed father until his death in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special talent and a special love to work with
elderly people, and she definitely had that,'' said her older
sister, Alice Redwine.
</P>
<P>
   Price was at her late father's home in Dover, where she had
spent much of her childhood, when Monday's tornado struck. She is
survived by a son, Jeffrey Don Price of McCloud; a granddaughter,
Natasha; three sisters; and a brother.
Molly Kughn, 76, Guthrie
</P>
<P>
   Kughn wasn't slowed by her age.
</P>
<P>
   In her later years, the widow kept busy, attending church
regularly, joining every club she could and working at the youth
center in the Abell community that she had called home for 23
years. On Monday Kughn's son, Gary, called his mother and told her
to go to the storm cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said `no, the cellar had water in it.' She decided to ride
the storm out,'' said her sister, Fayola Ambrose, 78.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm passed a neighbor tried to check on Kughn. He
sawed through a large tree that had fallen on the home but could
not find her in the rubble. She was later found in the nearby
pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Ann Arthur, 51, Midwest City
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, who had a heart transplant in July 1997, sang soprano in
the Hillcrest Christian Church choir, delivered meals to the
elderly and was a member of the Christian Women's Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very active for somebody who had health problems
herself,'' said friend and fellow church member Linda Hill. Arthur
was friendly and outgoing and loved ceramics, cake decorating and
working with the youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things I noticed about her is, she had very
beautiful fingernails, and she always painted each fingernail a
different color. She was that kind of person,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   When the tornado hit, Arthur was seeking shelter in a closet of
her home with her husband and mother, both of whom survived. Hill
said Arthur's husband, Melvin, returned Wednesday to find the house
destroyed but a few items untouched.
</P>
<P>
   His glasses sat on the bathroom cabinet. ``The china cabinet was
still sitting there with the china inside, and nothing was
broken,'' Hill said.
Kara Wiese, mid-20s, Bridge Creek
</P>
<P>
   Kara Wiese's world evolved around her 6-year-old son, Jordan,
family members said.
</P>
<P>
   The single mother was clutching her son tightly in the bathroom
when the tornado's strong winds ripped the family's mobile home
apart. Jordan was thrown into a nearby ravine and quickly sought
out a neighbor to help search for his missing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese was identified yesterday through fingerprints that her
mother had saved from her daughter's school days.
Others, including locations where their bodies were found:

NEIGHBORS FIND SAFETY IN SHELTER JUST BEFORE TORNADO ROARS THROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ In a scene that could have been written for the
movie ``Twister,'' Sheila Meadows and her family risked their
safety to save the lives of eight neighbors who outran Monday's
tornado and made it to the Meadows' storm shelter with less than a
minute to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows lived in a four-bedroom home at 620 N.W. 21st St. The
house, like most on the street, isn't there anymore. When Meadows
heard the tornado warning early Monday evening, she and her
teen-age daughters, Christina and Nikki, and 6-year-old son,
Victor, climbed into their shelter several feet underground.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows' husband is in the Army and stationed in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadows were joined by four others, and all were nervously
waiting for the tornado to pass when they heard someone fiercely
pounding on the door. Two of the men in the shelter opened the door
and were greeted by one of Meadows' neighbors, who motioned to
seven others running from a tornado now visible and gaining on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to climb over a chain-link fence, and the fence kept
rising up,'' Meadows said. ``One of my neighbor's daughters was
almost being blown away as they were helping her get over the
fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind was getting stronger and threatening to knock the door
off its chain latches as the eight neighbors struggled to reach
shelter. One by one, they climbed down the concrete stairs and
huddled close _ 16 people in a shelter built for eight.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the door was closed and secured. ``Then it got real
loud,'' Meadows said. ``The tornado hit and everything was shaking.
But we made it.''

INDUSTRIAL POWERS PROPOSE KOSOVO PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In what many described as an important
diplomatic breakthrough, the world's biggest industrialized nations
and Russia Thursday agreed on a plan they say could end the
conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the foreign ministers from the so-called Group of
Eight industrial powers were hailing their framework for an armed
international force in Kosovo, all sides stressed that wide gaps
remain between NATO and the Russians, who are sympathetic to their
fellow Orthodox Christian Slavs in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For example, NATO wants a total withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo while the Russians are talking about a partial withdrawal.
And NATO insists that its troops must be at the core of any
peacekeeping mission inserted into Kosovo, while the Russians say
it must be United Nations-led.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of NATO countries, including Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright, called the plan a breakthrough. Igor
Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, was more circumspect, saying,
``it would be premature to speak of a breakthrough, but progress
has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just a month after Russian politicians were warning that
the conflict between NATO and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
could start World War III, the joint statement of the G-8 countries
meeting outside Bonn was widely welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Belgrade permitted the return of UN
relief agencies to Kosovo, and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said
he would send a mission to assess the situation. UN agencies left
Kosovo before the start of the NATO air campaign on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said diplomats from the
``G-8'' countries will confer over the next few days to draft a UN
resolution to back the plan. The G-8 countries are the United
States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia, Canada, Italy and Japan.
Only Russia and Japan are not part of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official response from the Yugoslav government, but
in what some were taking as a hopeful sign official Serb media
Thursday night quoted Milosevic saying that he could pull his
troops out of Kosovo in a week if the bombing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Ending his two-day visit to Belgium and Germany, President
Clinton called the G-8 plan ``a significant step forward.'' Clinton
said the plan increased ``the likelihood that there will ultimately
be a resolution of this that will actually work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and other NATO country leaders insisted the bombing
would go on until Milosevic agreed to NATO's demands, which differ
from the G-8 plan only on the insistence that the peacekeeping
force have NATO ``at its core.'' Frustrated Russian diplomats
believe there would be a quick settlement if NATO stopped bombing
and let Milosevic save some face.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight day, the Yugoslav capital Belgrade was
not bombed, what some saw as a meager gesture to keep the
diplomatic momentum moving forward. Another gesture, some said, was
Milosevic's decision to let the moderate ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova to leave for Italy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, said Thursday that he believed that a
resolution of the conflict could come about even if Milosevic
remained in power _ a stunning admission given the heated rhetoric
from Clinton and other NATO leaders about Milosevic being a war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Keen to isolate Milosevic and bring the Russians closer to their
position, the western allies approved a statement that did not
mention NATO as being part of the peacekeeping force that everyone
agrees is needed to convince ethnic Albanian refugees to return
there after being forcefully expelled by the Serbs. In another
concession to Russian opinion, the G-8 will formally inform China
of their plan. China frequently votes with Russia against the west
in the UN.
</P>
<P>
   The plan talks of deploying ``effective international civil and
security presences, endorsed and adopted by the United Nations,
capable of guaranteeing the achievement of the common objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But foreign ministers from NATO countries insisted they had not
compromised on having a heavily-armed international force to keep
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must mean a strong military force with NATO at its
core,'' said Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign minister Joschka Fischer, who hosted the
two-hour talks Thursday, said that ``without robust military
presence, nothing will be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said refugees would not
return unless the protection afforded them was credible, not the
light arms of typical UN peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian diplomats were trying to persuade the NATO nations
to compromise on their insistence to lead the peacekeeping force,
saying it will give NATO their victory, and Milosevic his way out.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the peacekeeping force, the plan calls for an immediate
and verifiable end to violence and repression in Kosovo; withdrawal
of Serb forces from Kosovo; establishment by the UN of an interim
administration in Kosovo; the return of refugees, and a political
process to disarm the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army in return
for giving Kosovo ``substantial self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   But that last point insists that Kosovo remain part of
Yugoslavia, which ethnic Albanians are unlikely to accept given
what they say Serb forces have done in ethnically cleansing them
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent progress in diplomatic talks added fuel to another
dispute over Kosovo _ that between NATO and the KLA, which long
pleaded for a NATO intervention. Jakup Krasniqi, spokesman for the
KLA and its self-proclaimed government of Kosova, said any
international force in Kosovo should be led by NATO _ not the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is NATO that should command and control any force that is
sent to Kosovo _ not any other force outside NATO is acceptable,''
Krasniqi said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the KLA will not disarm, despite the fact that
demilitarization of the KLA was one of the key elements of the
Rambouillet agreement, which collapsed when Milosevic refused to
allow foreign troops in Kosovo to enforce the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all that has happened in Kosovo in the past months, we
cannot disarm the KLA,'' Krasniqi said. ``The circumstances under
which the KLA would agree to disarm do not exist, and I do not
think they will ever exist in the Balkans. Such a demand is
completely unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi also said the KLA was committed to independence, which
the West has opposed, but said they were open to having Kosovo as a
protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic has been largely blamed by the West for the
failure of peace talks earlier this year, the KLA also held up the
agreement. The rogue army was the last holdout on the Albanian
delegation side, and has said it will not give up its weapons, even
if there is a peacekeeping force in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The division among ethnic Albanians _ one which dragged out the
talks and threatened their implementation on the ground _ still
exists, even while they are at war with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has declared one government, headed by KLA leader Hasem
Thaqi, while the more moderate wing of the Albanian rebellion has
declared Bujar Bukoshi as its leader-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   Bukoshi is closer to the thinking of Rugova. Many Albanians are
still loyal to Rugova, who for a decade led a non-violent effort to
free Kosovar Albanians from Serb oppression. But an strong group of
Albanains now despises Rugova, saying the KLA's violent rebellion
is the only solution. Speaking Thursday in Rome, where he met with
Italian prime minister D'Alema, Rugova said he wanted an
international force that included NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The schism bodes poorly for political stability in Kosovo after
the fighting is over. But Krasniqi said the KLA would not fight the
Western soldiers to get their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA would not fight against the peacekeepers,'' he said.
``The KLA has an enemy to fight already.''

 &HT;    Wachovia appoints new chief for Georgia
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wachovia Bank has named Isaiah Tidwell president of
its Georgia operations. The bank becomes the second major financial
institution in recent months to name a minority executive to
oversee its business in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell, 54, formerly the regional executive in charge of the
Charlotte, N.C., area, is the bank's highest ranking
African-American executive. In March, Bank of America, which still
operates under the NationsBank name in Georgia, named a minority
executive, Michael H. Dulan, to be president of its Georgia
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell's appointment follows a series of management changes at
Wachovia that began when G. Joseph Prendergast, formerly the top
Atlanta-based executive with the bank, this year was named
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell succeeds D. Gary Thompson, 52, who now is CEO for the
bank in Georgia and Florida. Tidwell will report to Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coming will help us continue what has been very good
growth in this market,'' said Thompson, who added that Atlanta,
Charlotte, Tampa, Fla., and Richmond, Va., are viewed as strong
growth markets for Wachovia.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell, a native of Charlotte, has spent virtually all his
26-year banking career with Wachovia in North Carolina. He became a
regional vice president in 1990, assuming responsibility for
Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, home of the corporate
headquarters of both NationsBank and First Union, both aggressive
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it quite stimulating,'' Tidwell said. ``You wake up in
the morning, and there's no question who the competition is. You
just look at the office towers.''
</P>
<P>
   When he moves to Atlanta by early June, Tidwell said he
understands that his job will be ``growing the bank rapidly and
very profitably.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is an important market for Wachovia, representing about
30 percent of its revenue. Wachovia operates in 27 Georgia counties
and has 135 branches, 90 of them in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Tidwell said he intends to get involved in the
community. In Charlotte he was a past chairman of the Afro-American
Cultural Center board and past treasurer of the Charlotte Chamber
of Commerce. He also is a past chair of the Charlotte/Mecklenburg
Education Foundation, a former general campaign chairman of the
United Way of Forsyth County and its president in 1990.

 &HT;    TV screens hit minivans for movie watching, games
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a cross-country automobile trip in the '50s _
before freeways and air conditioning _ my sister and I amused and
annoyed each other by playing license-plate bingo, staring at
endless stretches of scenery and making funny noises.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, my own three kids amused and annoyed each
other on road trips _ thankfully on freeways and with air
conditioning _ by hogging the seats, playing the alphabet game and
making funny noises.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just in time for road trips with grandchildren, automakers
have found a way to amuse the back-seat passengers the whole way _
with movies and video games. And I don't mean movie soundtrack
tapes or hand-held Gameboys. These are real movies on videotape and
full-action games with a TV screen on which to play them.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile was first out of the blocks with its Silhouette
Premiere minivan equipped with a factory-installed pop-down TV
screen and a bank of controls for the videotape, game, radio and CD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. isn't far behind. A rear-seat entertainment
system that will play movies or video games is an option on Ford
Windstar and Mercury Villager minivans. The console-mounted system
built by Ford unit Visteon will be available for all automakers'
minivans, sport-utility vehicles and conventional vans by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A DaimlerChrysler spokesman said the automaker has no plans to
add a similar option in its segment-leading minivans, explaining
that the company is looking at the technology but is concerned
about the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In an affinity marketing campaign, Oldsmobile is teaming with
the American Film Institute, Sony and Blockbuster for an
interlocking tour and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   AFI recently brought its touring collection of movie memorabilia
and props to Northlake Mall. Blockbuster is stocking some of the
AFI's best 100 movies of the past century. Oldsmobile dealerships
might have a movie theme for the Silhouette in the showroom.
Prospects who test drive the minivan get $25 gift cards, funded by
Oldsmobile, for Blockbuster movies. Sony shows off its DVD
technology at the AFI display and is marketing its video games to
minivan buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Rainbolt, assistant brand manager for Silhouette, said the
minivan's entertainment system is the first one on the market to be
fully integrated into the vehicle. Aftermarket systems have been
available for years.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is designed to keep everybody happy.
</P>
<P>
   The controls for the video, CD and radio are in both the front
and back. When the radio is off, sound for the video systems comes
through the speakers. But turn the radio on, and headphones are
needed for video or CD listening. That way, front passengers can
enjoy their music while one rear-seat passenger rocks to a CD and
the other blasts space aliens on the video screen.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid crystal display monitor, mounted on the roof just
behind the front seats, flips up and out of the way when not in
use. Even when it's down, it doesn't block the rearview mirror. The
rear controls are mounted alongside the screen and include a
universal adapter for video games.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment system is part of the Silhouette's Premiere
package, which includes a whole menu of extras. It has a sticker
price of $31,680, about $3,500 more than the base price of the
next-lower-priced minivan.
</P>
<P>
   GM is beginning to install the entertainment center _ covered by
the factory warranty _ in the Pontiac Montana and eventually will
add it to the Chevrolet Venture.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials say sales of the Silhouette have exceeded
expectations. The company hopes to sell more than 40,000
Silhouettes this year, about one-third of them with the Premiere
package.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Visteon system is mounted in a console between the front
seats. The $1,299 system can be ordered with a new vehicle, where
it is installed as the vehicle comes out of the assembly plant, or
added to an older vehicle at a Ford or Mercury dealership, said
Mark Horvath, a marketing specialist with Visteon. Installations in
other vehicles may be through auto dealers or audio stores, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The setup is integrated for automobile use, but it also can be
removed when the owner changes vehicles. A Nintendo 64 system is
part of the package, but other game systems also can be used. The
videotape player is part of the console, and the whole thing can
operate with or independently of the vehicle's audio system.
</P>
<P>
   Sales data were not available yet, but Horvath anticipates
Visteon will sell all the systems it can supply.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, license-plate bingo will never be the same if
the driver has to play it alone.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola tries to soothe investors on suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola has sent a letter about a recently filed
racial discrimination lawsuit against the company to about two
dozen large institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, the cornerstone of our share-owner affairs has
been the process of enhanced dialogue and proactive communication
on any issue of concern,'' wrote Thomas Paris III, manager of
share-owner affairs. ``While we believe the lawsuit is without
merit, I wanted to write and assure you that our management team
takes these allegations seriously. Discrimination in any form is
not tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta federal court suit filed two weeks ago by four
current or former African-American employees alleges that Coca-Cola
systematically discriminates against blacks in pay, promotions,
performance evaluations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not true,'' Paris wrote, adding that there are
``significant errors of fact throughout the lawsuit which we will
address in our response to the complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys had no comment Thursday on Paris'
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the letter was not unusual given the
company's proactive nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have regular, ongoing dialogue with institutional share
owners,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has had no apparent impact on the company's stock,
which is up 4 percent over the past two weeks. The stock closed
Thursday at $69.12 1/2, down $1.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to investors is similar to e-mail sent by Coca-Cola
Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester to the company's
10,000 U.S. employees.
</P>
<P>
   That e-mail is the subject of a federal court hearing next week.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs contend that Ivester violated a local
court rule when he sent the e-mail message to salaried black
employees. The attorneys said he is prevented from communicating
about the lawsuit with potential members of a class-action suit
without court approval.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so 1,500 salaried
black employees can be included in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said the plaintiffs' attempt to get a court
order preventing Ivester from communicating with black employees
about the suit is a typical legal maneuver that has no validity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story is to hold a hearing on the
issue Thursday.

 &HT;    Honda picks Alabama for $400 million plant
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ After months of secret negotiations, Honda
made it official, announcing it will build an auto and engine plant
on 1,350 acres off Interstate 20 near Lincoln, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the 1.7 million square foot, $400 million plant
will begin in mid-2000. The plant will build either minivans or
sport-utility vehicles and employ about 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia economic development officials, who earlier acknowledged
that Honda had considered Georgia, expressed optimism that the
plant's economic benefits will ripple into this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Honda officials would have given a stronger look at
Georgia,'' said Tim Chason, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce's chief
operating officer. ``I still look at it as an opportunity for our
state to compete for the suppliers to Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   Chason suggested that although there are no glaring
deficiencies, the state needs to review how competitive its
economic incentives are for car makers. Gov. Roy Barnes has
promised to review the state's overall industrial incentives this
year. Georgia's incentives have been viewed as conservative
compared to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Honda made no mention of other states it considered for the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company chose the Alabama site because of the ``outstanding
community of people, excellent transportation systems and the
necessary infrastructure to support industry,'' said Koichi
Amemiya, president and chief executive officer of American Honda
Motor Co., Honda's North American subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   More than $158 million in tax abatements and incentives from
Alabama and local governments helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   The major incentives include the $16 million site, the state is
providing $55.6 million in tax breaks, a $30 million training
program and about $45 million in improvements _ mostly roads _
around the site.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with an estimated $325 million the state used to
bring the Mercedes-Benz sport-utility plant to Vance., Ala., in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Don Siegelman welcomed the company, saying in Japanese,
``Our friendship will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman said the incentives offered to Honda were the same
that would be offered to any major company coming to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the plant builds a new sport-utility or the company's
Odyssey minivan will depend on market conditions over the next few
years, said Richard E. Colliver, executive vice president with
American Honda. The plant will be capable of building both.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Alliston, Ontario, minivan plant is unable to keep
up with demand he said. While the minivan and sport-utility market
has grown rapidly, Honda hasn't been able to keep up, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeff Schuster with J.D. Power in Michigan said a new
Honda SUV would replace the company's current Honda Passport and
Acura SLX. Both are built for Honda in Indiana by Isuzu. Schuster
said Honda wants to improve the quality of vehicles carrying its
names.
</P>
<P>
   Honda said it will hire most of the workers locally. The company
will begin accepting applications in late 2000, and hiring will
begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wages will be competitive, officials said. In Ohio, the pay at
Honda assembly plants is about $20 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is unusual because it will build both vehicles and
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a manufacturing viewpoint, the new plant in Alabama is a
different approach. In Ohio, vehicle and engine production are
housed in different plants.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, we will combine them into one efficient plant,''
said Koki Hirashima, CEO of Honda of American Manufacturing. The
V-6 engines will be built from recycled aluminum ingots, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it was too early to determine what suppliers
will be used. Generally, suppliers locate near an assembly plant to
facilitate just-in-time delivery of parts.
</P>
<P>
   Hirashima pointed out, ``We don't decide which suppliers will
come.''

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T's deal likely to benefit Time Warner
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time Warner is not part of AT&AMP;T's tentative purchase
of MediaOne, but the 800-pound gorilla of the media business could
score big in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a change in MediaOne's ownership would eliminate
a quarrelsome partner for Time Warner. It also would create a
potential opportunity for Time Warner to regain full control of its
highly valuable entertainment assets.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne owns 25.5 percent of Time Warner Entertainment, a
venture that owns Warner Bros. TV and movie studios, premium cable
TV channel HBO and Time Warner Cable. Time Warner owns the
remaining 74.5 percent of the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Entertainment has been a venture marked by
often-bitter quarreling among the partners. But now, with the
potential entry of AT&AMP;T, the chemistry of the venture is poised to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Time Warner declined to comment on its entertainment
venture or AT&AMP;T's tentative deal to buy MediaOne, the third-largest
cable TV operator, for $62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's only comment has been a statement by Chairman
Gerald Levin, which applauded how Comcast President Brian Roberts
handled himself in his losing bid for MediaOne. Roberts and Levin
have long been close allies and friends.
</P>
<P>
   While quiet publicly, Time Warner is closely studying AT&AMP;T's
deal. The company sees plenty of opportunity on a variety of
fronts, depending on how the final deal is structured.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must also win federal regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Time Warner are not strangers. Months ago, the
companies struck a tentative deal for AT&AMP;T to provide local
telephone service through Time Warner's digital cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the companies each control a cable modem service
that provides high-speed access to the Internet through digital
cable TV networks. Time Warner's service is called Road Runner and
AT&AMP;T's At Home. The two services are not direct competitors because
they serve separate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both AT&AMP;T and Time Warner could cut costs and strengthen
marketing of cable modems by combining or forming a strategic
partnership between Road Runner and At Home.
</P>
<P>
   But where AT&AMP;T as MediaOne's new owner could help Time Warner
the most is in the entertainment venture. The venture was created
in the early 1990s as a way for Time Warner to help finance the
high cost of reconfiguring its cable systems as digital networks.
</P>
<P>
   That involved selling off stakes in Time Warner's entertainment
assets to a variety of companies, including what was then U S West.
U S West eventually spun off its cable assets into MediaOne, which
also held the company's stake in Time Warner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a collegial partnership. The two quarreled from
the start, the battles intensifying in recent years. Time Warner,
for example, never notified MediaOne that it would make a bid for
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting is now a unit of Time Warner, and MediaOne
has resisted several of the unit's big initiatives. MediaOne, for
instance, has refused to pay a price increase for carrying Turner
Broadcasting's TNT cable TV channel. It also won't pay new fees to
carry sister channel TBS, although almost every other cable TV
operator does.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Time Warner wouldn't mind finding a new
partner for its entertainment venture. But some industry observers
also wonder whether the venture has outlived its purpose. Time
Warner, after all, has completed much of the expensive rebuilding
of its networks.
</P>
<P>
   While Time Warner won't comment, some industry observers believe
the company may seek to buy back the 25.5 percent of its
entertainment assets outside its control. Indeed, the company has
been moving in that direction for years, having bought out every
other partner except MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   But will AT&AMP;T be ready to sell off MediaOne's stake in Time
Warner Entertainment? Only time will tell.

BRISTOL-MYERS PLEDGES $100 MILLION TO AIDS FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unprecedented effort by a private corporation to stem the
AIDS epidemic and provide care for its poorest victims, a leading
US-based pharmaceutical company Thursday pledged $100 million over
the next five years to fight AIDS in five hard-hit African nations.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution, by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., will fund
programs to prevent new AIDS-virus infections and to provide care,
including drug treatment, to a region where 3.5 million people _
more than 7 percent of the population _ are already infected. Few
can afford the costly drugs used to treat the disease in developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The additional $20 million a year amounts to a 14 percent jump
in total AIDS funding in sub-Saharan Africa, where currently only
about $140 million is available to fight the disease. South Africa,
Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland will share the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, director of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS
agency, said he hoped the drug company's move ``will be imitated by
more multinational companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The new money will be targeted in part to programs to improve
care for women and children in nations where 16 to 36 percent of
pregnant women carry the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research has shown drugs given during pregnancy can cut
in half the rate of HIV transmission from mother to infant at a
cost of about $80 per case. But providing such treatment requires a
chain of support services seldom found in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot parachute the drugs into these countries. We need
the infrastructure to deliver care,'' said Dr. Joseph Saba of
UNAIDS, who has campaigned vigorously for drug company
contributions. ``We need well-trained doctors and nurses;
laboratory facilities for people to get tested; pharmacies where
the drugs can be made available and managed properly. We need
patients to be aware of the treatments they need and how to take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a $25 million pledge this week by Microsoft's
William Gates to support AIDS vaccine research, the Bristol-Myers
Squibb contribution heartened activists who have recently worried
about a decline in AIDS-fighting support in this country and
abroad. ``It indicates a dramatic rise in interest in the global
pandemic,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action,
a Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to hear these things years ago,'' said
Jacob A. Gayle Jr., the UNAIDS liaison to the World Bank, who spoke
Thursday night at a Boston forum on African AIDS sponsored by the
21st Century Group, an organization of black professionals.
``However, hopefully 20 years hence we'll look back and say this
contribution began a whole new era of response to this epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol-Myers Squibb chairman and chief executive, Charles
A. Hiembold Jr., said the $18.3 billion-a-year firm felt ``a moral
obligation to take action against this grave situation.'' But
company executives and consultants noted that the step will serve
the drug firm's commercial interests as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty. I think the company will benefit from this,''
said Barry Scott, vice president of Bristol-Myers Squibb's
international division. ``I don't know how.. . .But I'd be avoiding
the obvious to say there would be no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Marlink of the Harvard AIDS Institute, who will
serve on a scientific advisory board for the new project, said the
contribution ``will buy goodwill. It may open doors. If I were in
the upper reaches of a pharmaceutical company very involved in AIDS
drugs, I would note that this epidemic is growing, and it's
disproportionately affecting southern Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb makes three leading AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Like other AIDS-drug manufacturers, it has recently been alarmed
by threats from some African nations to manufacture cheap,
unauthorized versions of costly AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to South Africa's health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma,
Scott added: ``Certainly we are challenging the health minister on
intellectual properties issues and we will continue to challenge
her on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said those threats ``did not enter into'' the
company's decision to contribute $100 million to South Africa and
four neighboring countries.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Gonzales, a waiter from Los Angeles who earns about
$25,000 a year, has been in a buying mood lately. ``Things are
going well for me these days,'' he reflected, while shopping at
Home Depot in Los Angeles for supplies to refurbish his apartment.
``It's not like I'm spending mountains of cash. Just enough for a
few comforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 28, adds, ``I'm older, so I can't stand living
someplace that looks ratty.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether snapping up bathroom fixtures at Home Depot,
shrink-wrapped T-shirts at Old Navy or wide-screen televisions at
Circuit City, American consumers are on a rampage, increasing their
spending even faster than they did last year. In the first four
months of this year, sales in stores open at least one year rose
6.7 percent from the corresponding period last year, one of the
biggest jumps in years, according to the Goldman Sachs retail
composite index. That increase comes on top of a dizzying 5.1
percent increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   For growth in consumption to actually accelerate after eight
years of economic expansion is a surprise _ the torrid pace had
been expected to slow. Retail analysts and economists now point to
numerous factors, including the continued rise of both the stock
market and home values, to explain much of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   But another change is also helping: While the wealthiest
consumers powered the expansion in its early stages, spending by
those in the bottom 40 percent of income, defined as households
making up to $28,500 a year, has been picking up. Real growth in
wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years have spread the
shopping spree into every corner of American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that for the first time in two-and-a-half
decades, workers' broad-based wage gains are generally driving
consumption throughout the economy,'' said Jared Bernstein, an
economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute based in
Washington. ``It is not just the wealth bubble at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first years of the economy's expansion, middle- and
low-income Americans increased their spending, but at a much slower
pace than wealthy households, those making over $47,000.
Consumption by those earning less than $28,500 grew 10 percent from
1993 (a nadir in consumer spending for this group) through 1997,
whereas spending by the richest fifth of Americans, those earning
over $73,000, grew 25 percent, according to Edward Wolff, an
economist at New York University who has analyzed the federal
government's Consumer Expenditure Survey. Wolff projects that this
will change when the government data are made available for 1998.
Spending by the group making less than $47,000 will have grown by 5
percent, he estimates, and spending by the richest by only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the inflation-adjusted pay of the bottom 20 percent
of wage earners has grown 5 percent to 10 percent since 1996 while
their savings rate has hovered around zero, economists say it is
safe to conclude that their additional earnings are going to new
purchases. The earned-income tax credit (expanded in 1994) has also
given them some additional buying power.
</P>
<P>
   But low earners are taking on additional debt too, as credit
card companies court them and federal programs encourage them to
buy their own homes and assume mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get the '98 and '99 data, it will become very clear
that they are accounting for a very sizable share of the growth in
consumer spending,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for RFA,
an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   All this is not to discount the spending power of the rich. As
the biggest beneficiaries of sharp gains in the stock market, the
wealthiest fifth of Americans are consuming as conspicuously as
ever. Their intense appetite for luxury items has created a boom
market for upscale cars and for homes that rival the gaudiest
mansions of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the giddy spending is the fierce resurgence of the
ultimate income showpiece: fur. Not only are mink stoles in fashion
for the fall, but designers are using fancy animal pelts for all
manner of clothing from sweaters of royal blue chinchilla to skirts
in shearling.
</P>
<P>
   But if the rich are enjoying a sumptuous banquet, the remainder
of Americans are not just scooping up table scraps, as many critics
of Reaganomics argued was the case in the 1980s expansion. In
everything from apparel to electronics to home furnishings, these
Americans are making their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, they are speeding the rise of value-oriented
emporiums and highlighting the growing troubles of retailers that
cater to the middle market. In previous economic booms, low-income
people tended to trade up to more expensive stores. This time
around, they are sticking with those that offer them the best
deals, and they are being joined by more affluent Americans, who
are increasingly willing to shop both in chichi boutiques and in
stores that offer cut-rate prices.
</P>
<P>
   In previous months, the surging buying power of lower earners
has helped move Target Stores, Kmart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
to the head of the retail pack. In April, sales at discount stores
rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs,
much slower than in previous months but still impressive
considering that Easter sales were recorded in March this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This segment is winning big because it has transformed itself
from pragmatic but grim to stylish yet affordable. Target, a unit
of Dayton Hudson Corp., is the most obvious practitioner of the
strategy, but not its only one. It employs a brigade of trend
hunters who bring the hippest clothing designs to the stores in a
timely manner and recently unveiled a home design collection by the
renowned architect Michael Graves, featuring retro-chic tea kettles
and toasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago there were no major brands in the discounters;
then somebody finally woke up,'' said Adelle Kirk, director of
marketing for Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm.
``These days discounters very successfully deliver fashion,
terrific merchandising, and brands _ all at value prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market researchers argue that the more polished approach,
in the best tradition of retail, is doing more than simply filling
a need. It is also creating new desires to fuel the economy. In
other words, home-and-hearth avatar Martha Stewart, whose products
are now available at Kmart stores, is making 200-thread-count
cotton bed sheets in sunflower yellow something that most every
American can aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Clark, 21, has two jobs, one as a data entry clerk at a
bank and another as a cashier at a grocery store. She says she
regularly visits Target in her home town of Memphis, even on
evenings when she goes out with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always spend way too much when I come here, but I always
find other things to buy,'' Ms. Clark laments. ``Today I came to
buy detergent and fabric softener, and I ended up with two plastic
lawn chairs, plants, electronic games, candles, socks and a utility
knife. I thought I would spend maybe $25, but I spent $106 instead.
Every time I come here, I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other winners in this environment are also stores that
emphasize good value. This includes Home Depot Inc. and the
electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc. Old Navy, the stylish
low-cost clothing chain started by the Gap in 1994, has also
repeatedly registered double-digit sales growth in the last year
and reported a 7 percent increase in the latest monthly sales
report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, stores that cater to the middle class, like Sears,
Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co., are finding it hard to get
solid footing. Both stores Thursday reported slight sales declines
in April from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc, said,
``The companies who are losing market share need to reposition
themselves as value leaders, or they are not going to last.'' &QL;

EBOLA-LIKE DISEASE IDENTIFIED AS CAUSE OF 59 DEATHS IN CONGO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Congo, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya)   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The disease that has killed 59 people in
northeastern Congo is caused not by Ebola but by a similar virus
that is nearly as deadly but not as contagious, doctors reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Biot, of the medical group Doctors Without Borders,
said a blood sample from one victim who died showed the disease to
be caused by the Marburg virus, named after the city in Germany
where it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ebola, the virus causes high fevers and heavy bleeding but
is not transmitted as easily to other people, Biot said. There is
no cure.
</P>
<P>
   A team of doctors from Doctors Without Borders traveled this
week to the town of Durba in Congo, near the border both with Sudan
and Uganda, to investigate the deaths. Nearly all of the victims
have been miners who work illegally in a closed gold mine, living
together in filthy conditions and drinking water that drips from
the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Biot said that 76 people might have been infected, and that most
of them worked in the mine. But he said the number of cases did not
appear to be spreading outside that group, though doctors are still
interviewing people in the area. An exception was a doctor who died
after treating the miners; his blood tested positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might cautiously say that this is not a very large
epidemic,'' Biot said.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms are similar to those caused by Ebola, the most
deadly of the so-called hemorrhagic fevers. In 1995, 244 people
were killed in an outbreak of Ebola in the city of Kikwit, in
western Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But laboratory tests conducted in South Africa showed it to be
Marburg disease, which Biot said had never infected a large number
of people outside a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one people were infected by the disease in a laboratory
in Marburg in 1967, in an outbreak believed to be caused by a group
of African monkeys there. Biot said that nearly a quarter of the
people had died, and that much smaller, recent outbreaks in
Zimbabwe and Kenya had claimed more victims.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the disease suffer from early symptoms that resemble
malaria _ headache, as well as fever and pains in joints and
muscles. On the second day, diarrhea and vomiting begin, and soon
blood appears in both. Death usually occurs on the sixth day.

 &HT;    Churchs seeking female franchisees
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Women like Bridget Chisholm who are interested in
franchising are getting a helping hand from Atlanta-based Churchs
Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a division of AFC Enterprises, announced Thursday a
new program aimed at increasing the ranks of female franchisees and
diversity in its restaurant system. The Churchs Professional
Mentoring Program, which will initially last about a year, will be
launched this month during a restaurant industry trade show in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm, a Memphis, Tenn., businesswoman, is among three women
who have the rights to develop four Churchs restaurants in the
city. ``This program will help women know that opportunities are
out there,'' Chisholm said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, about 80 percent of all new businesses will be owned by
women, but females will head only 10 percent of franchises, said
Hala Moddelmog, president of 1,400-unit Churchs and one of the
highest-ranking women in the quick-service restaurant industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real gap there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 20 percent of Churchs franchisees in the United
States are women, a number Moddelmog would like to see grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've definitely done a better job than others, but we realize
that there's opportunity to dig into why women are not going into
franchising,'' she said. Reasons include access to capital and a
perception that franchising does not lend itself to creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed to address both issues. Moddelmog said
she hopes to match women with investment capital with women who are
interested in running franchises. Additionally, she wants to
establish a mentoring program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Churchs is starting the program, the hope is that other
AFC divisions will use similar approaches and eventually it will
spread throughout the industry. Other divisions include Popeyes
Chicken &AMP; Biscuits and Cinnabon International.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Rosenthal, a spokesman for the Maryland-based National
Foundation for Women Business, said the program will help more
women enter the ranks of entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any program that recognizes the expertise and significant
economic clout of women is a good program,'' Rosenthal said.
``While women business owners have made significant progress within
the last decade, there are still some challenges in respect to
access to capital and in general with women-owned firms being taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago kickoff, which will be held May 24, is accessible
via the Internet. Participants can access the forum at
www.churchs.com.

 &HT;    Publishers jump on NASCAR bandwagon
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Publishers used to believe auto racing fans didn't
read books. A few wondered aloud if they could read at all. For
years, stock car racing was considered by some to be a blue-collar
event where hard-drinking good ol' boys made fools of themselves in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Books on auto racing suddenly are a hot commodity among New York
publishers. ``There's a huge market out there for books on
NASCAR,'' says Ed Hinton, a Sports Illustrated staffer who recently
signed a $231,000 deal with Warner to write a book on racing at
Daytona, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the interest, Hinton says, is that the
demographics have changed significantly in the past 10 years. ``The
income and educational level of the fans is way up. My wife and I
went to Talladega and sat in the grandstand recently, and we were
astounded at how quiet the crowd was. NASCAR is being overrun by
nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinton, 50, a former Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer who
lives in Cumming, says his book will be a combination of stories
about the drivers and a history of the sport. ``What I did in the
proposal was to write a sampling of the kinds of stories I sit
around and tell people. It's going to be about a rollicking bunch
of guys and the mischief they got into.''
</P>
<P>
   The book won't be finished until next winter, but Hinton has
already been besieged by Hollywood producers anxious to make a
deal. ``Last weekend I met with a guy who's interested in a six- to
10-part HBO miniseries, and another guy who's interested in making
a big, epic film and wants to get started right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Why all the interest in racing? Tom Cruise's 1990 movie ``Days
of Thunder,'' the emergence of driver Jeff Gordon as a sexy
superstar, and the number of cable channels that carry racing may
all be factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Bobby Cox and a lot of the Braves watch racing on
TV after the games,'' Hinton says. ``And attendance at races has
doubled since 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   AT WIT'S END: When Margaret Edson's play ``Wit'' won the
Pulitzer Prize, publishers Faber and Faber suddenly found
themselves in an embarrassing situation. Since play scripts
published as books rarely sell well, the company had printed only a
few thousand copies of the $12 paperback. Amazon.com quickly sold
out and Faber and Faber had to rush back to press for more copies
of the 37-year-old Atlanta kindergarten teacher's play about a
woman's confrontation with terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Edson's fellow Pulitzer winner Michael Cunningham is
reaping the benefits of the prize as well. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux
has gone back to press twice with ``The Hours,'' for a total of
115,000 copies. This has been a good year for Cunningham, who also
won the PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction and the American Library
Association's Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Award.
</P>
<P>
   IRISH ROOTS: Frank Gannon is hoping some of the luck of the
Irish that Frank McCourt enjoyed with ``Angela's Ashes'' will rub
off on him. The Demorest humorist and essayist has signed a
six-figure deal with Warner Books to write a nonfiction book with a
first-generation Irish theme. ``The book is about me, as a
middle-aged guy, realizing that even though both of his parents
were born in Ireland, he knows nothing about his Irishness,'' says
Gannon, the author of ``Yo, Poe!'' and a contributor to GQ and The
New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Gannon's parents talked about the old country, so
he's having to do a lot of detective work in Ireland and on Ellis
Island. ``I'm finding out that my dad, in a strange way, hated
Ireland. Anything that reminded him of the farm life he had back
there, he blocked out. Almost every day since I started the book,
I've found something that either made me laugh very hard, made me
angry or made me feel like crying.'' Gannon expects to finish the
book in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   MORE PRIZES: The New Yorker magazine is launching yet another
literary competition. The prestigious magazine will award $10,000
in each of five categories: lifetime achievement, fiction,
nonfiction, poetry and best first work. Nominees will be listed in
the last issue of the year and winners _ selected by readers _ will
be announced on Feb. 14, 2000, on the magazine's 75th anniversary.

 &HT;    Biting, funny film about politics transcends its high school
class
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might be laughing too hard to notice, at first, the
melancholy edges of ``Election,'' a high school satire from the
director of ``Citizen Ruth.'' Unlike the dozen other teen flicks at
the mall, the film has a grip on the kind of mundane reality that
usually gets exiled from mainstream movies. It's a broad comedy
grounded with precise anthropological observation _ a combination
that can make you both giggle and wince.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a Nebraska schoolteacher
who really, really loves his job. His chipper, cheery notion of a
peaceful status quo is exactly what the movie sets out to upset.
``It wasn't just a job for me,'' he says in voice-over. ``I got
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, he becomes too involved, thanks to student Tracy
Flick (Reese Witherspoon), whose perky persona masks a ruthless
lust for power. Her latest target: presidency of the student
government. Tracy goes out for everything, whether it's acting in
the school production of ``Fiddler on the Roof'' or reporting news
blurbs for the student TV station. ``I volunteered for every
committee, as long as I could lead it,'' she says in her own
voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Letting us into the heads of both these characters, the movie
clues us in to director Alexander Payne's bigger issue.
``Election'' takes a skeptical look at the idea of ``truth'' by
showing us the same situation, ``Rashomon''-style, from different
perspectives. Additional points of view come from two other
students, the popular jock Paul (Chris Klein) and his lesbian kid
sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell). They constitute a round-robin
chorus of self-deluded rationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   They're all involved in the presidential race, thanks to Jim. He
urges Paul to run against the unopposed Tracy. Tammy also enters
the race in anger when she finds out that her ex-girlfriend is now
dating her brother. (Fair warning: The story is driven by the
characters' libidos, resulting in some frank sexual scenes and
dialogue.)
</P>
<P>
   The film's unspoken idea is that nobody really enters politics
for the good of their constituents; a personal agenda is the glue
that holds up campaign posters. In ``Election'' we watch the
characters (well, except for Paul, who's too dim to scheme) break
rules and lie to get what they want. It's one of the movie's balder
jokes that Jim teaches his students the difference between ethics
and morals, even as his vendetta against Tracy blurs his own
integrity, at school and at home.
</P>
<P>
   While the plot makes ``Election'' sound like a bouncy comedy,
it's really a bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell
themselves to justify their actions. Payne, shooting in his native
Nebraska, uncovers a plaintive beauty in the bland, blue-gray
landscape that underscores his cruelly funny tone.
</P>
<P>
   In the supporting cast, Klein delivers an endearing goofiness,
speaking in the awed tones of a guy educated on self-help manuals;
he makes Keanu Reeves look like a Fulbright scholar. Campbell is
terrific as Tammy, whose clear-eyed self-interest marks her as the
character most likely to succeed in life, if not in school. Her
bluntly practical platform for the presidency is one of the movie's
highlights, as she tells the other students, ``Vote for me because
I don't even want to go to college, and I don't care!''
</P>
<P>
   As a decent guy who gets in over his head, Broderick is ideal,
lending both his boyish charisma and memories of his 1986 screen
role as class cutter Ferris Bueller. Witherspoon is a perfect foil,
a lethal kewpie doll with a glass-cutting chipmunk voice. (Fans of
the actress should check out her hilarious, white-trash-sexpot
performance in the barely released ``Freeway,'' a ``Red Riding
Hood'' update set in a trailer-park landscape.)
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Flick is the sort of megalomaniac whom Max Fischer, the
hero of ``Rushmore,'' would either adore or battle to the death.
The films have more than that in common. Both are sharp originals
that find fresh bite in that most strip-mined of movie settings,
the high school. Here's hoping that ``Election'' doesn't tank at
the box office the way ``Rushmore'' did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' ends with one last glimpse of Tracy, a visual punch
line that's terribly resonant in a world where Monica Lewinsky can
derail the nation's political process. By its final reel, the movie
has reduced lofty ethical arguments to the absurd, impotent splat
of a soft-drink cup hurled against the side of a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by
Alexander Payne. Rated R for strong sexuality, sex-related dialogue
and language, and a scene of drug use. At metro theaters. 1 hour,
44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A cruelly funny satire of the political process,
set in high school.

 &HT;    Columnist builds from his experience to help other men raise
their children
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took more than three decades for Leonard Pitts Jr. to realize
how much he hated his father. And how much he missed him.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Pitts had just finished a job interview with
a prospective employer when he was asked to return for a second
day. That's when he panicked. He had brought only one tie, which
his wife had pre-knotted for him, and he didn't want to wear it
again.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed out to buy a new tie, but later, as he fumbled
futilely with the knot, it hit him: He couldn't tie a tie because
his father never taught him.
</P>
<P>
   The tie was a little thing, Pitts says, but it is symbolic of
what is missing in the lives of men who grow up without a father's
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least my father was there physically, if not emotionally,''
says Pitts, a syndicated columnist for The Miami Herald and author
of a new book, ``Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to
Fatherhood'' (Longstreet Press, $22). ``So many black men cannot
say the same.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, he says, their fathers were dead or they never came
around. When they did, they drank and fought and left the house in
an uproar. Pitts' childhood in bad sections of Los Angeles was a
nightmare of abuse and violence at the hands of an alcoholic father
who was disappointed that his son was more interested in reading
books than playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts never did learn to tie a tie properly, but he did learn to
be a father to his five children. ``A fair-to-middling father,'' he
says with a smile on a recent stop in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, the 41-year-old writer recounts the struggle to
cope with his anger toward his father and become a better parent
himself. Interspersed with his memories are stories of other
African-American men facing the same difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``My publisher wanted me to write a book about fatherhood, but
what they wanted was a lighter book, a Bill Cosby-type book,''
Pitts says. ``I felt if I was going to deal with fatherhood, it
would be emotionally and intellectually dishonest of me not to deal
with those issues that had bubbled beneath the surface so many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts acknowledges that he is more fortunate than many of the
African-American kids who grow up in single parent families.
Sixty-four percent of black children are raised by poor mothers.
With no positive male role models, males face a greater risk for
delinquency and females are more likely to get pregnant in their
teens.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitts, an avid reader, was able to climb out of poverty,
earn a degree at the University of Southern California, and land a
lucrative and prestigious job with The Miami Herald, where he has
won three national Headliner Awards and was a finalist for the 1992
Pulitzer Prize for commentary. He credits his mother for much of
his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people I was raised by Superwoman. She was in a
bad neighborhood but not of it. She also carried herself with a
certain gravity and authority and a certain expectation that as a
child this is the way you should be. It was very powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, many organizations offer help in breaking the cycle of
families without fathers. Among those cited by Pitts in ``Becoming
Dad'' is Charles Ballard's Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and
Family Revitalization in Washington, which grapples with the
escalating problem caused by divorce and welfare laws that penalize
young mothers who marry. Ballard's nonprofit group trains and pays
married couples with children to move into communities with a high
percentage of single-parent homes, crimes and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask them to meet their neighbors, go to churches and
synagogues and get to know everybody,'' Ballard says. ``In the
process, they recruit people who want to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they reach the men who are in trouble _ abused sons
who are now fathers themselves. ``We work with them in their
homes,'' Ballard says. ``Everybody wants to talk about their
relationships with their fathers. We work them through their hatred
and violence. In 30 to 60 days, we've seen violent situations
dissipate. Once they forgive their fathers and deal with their
past, they are able to find jobs and take responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In his research, Pitts was encouraged to discover that there
were many men, like himself, who survived troubled relationships
with their dads yet managed to become good fathers.
</P>
<P>
   But he also encountered a number of black men who avoided all
responsibilities of fatherhood, did not know how many children they
had, and blamed racism for their predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to them is: Quit giving yourself excuses to fail.
Yes, I know that racism impacts upon our abilities to be good
fathers, but racism impacts upon everything we do. Why should this
be an exception?''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts' success as an award-winning journalist, however, never
made up for the pain of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take college degrees and status and money and try to
cover it up,'' Ballard says. ``But you can't cover up the wounds of
abandonment. When your father leaves you, you think he's telling
you that you're no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts finally came to terms with ambivalent feelings that had
festered for years by writing a letter to his late father. A
counselor suggested the letter as a way of putting his emotions in
words, turning the page and moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny thing about forgiving somebody,'' Pitts writes in
the book. ``People think you do it as a boon to the person who
wronged you. But I think it's a favor you do to yourself. A way of
letting your own heart off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as father to his five children, Pitts is trying to
make sure he doesn't repeat the mistakes of his dad. He talks to
his kids, plays video games and reads comic books with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big kid at heart,'' he says, ``but I have to remind them
that I'm not their friend _ I'm their parent. I'm the authority
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that means resorting to his late mother's disciplinary
approach to child rearing. Unlike many other baby boomers, Pitts
will use corporal punishment as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it right , you won't have to do it often. Never do
it in anger. It's like the threat of nuclear warfare ... it's the
ultimate thing. A lot of baby boomers, we don't want to be hard.
But if your kid has not hated you recently, you probably aren't
doing your job right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the parental supervision in the world, Pitts says,
you can never know everything your kids are doing. As they get
older, they have large sections of their lives that parents know
nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no compunction about going into my kids' rooms and
looking around. But still you can't know what they're doing 24
hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites the recent massacre at Columbine High School as an
example of this. When someone takes a year to plan a massacre, he
says, you can't say that MTV made them do it, or that they did it
because their dads didn't take them to a Little League game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is trying to find something or someone to pin this
on. Everybody wants to jump on the parents, but we know nothing
about the parents. We have to face the fact that a small fraction
of people are inherently bad. No one could believe it happened in
this small town, but it happens all the time in urban areas. It
shouldn't happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   All parents can do, he adds, is give kids the tools to cope with
a very complex and very dangerous world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be there when somebody offers them a joint or hands
them a gun,'' Pitts says. ``You just have to hope they make the
right choice.''

 &HT;    Slow meltdown hits `Arctic Circle'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fickle finger of fate, as they used to call it on the old
``Laugh-In'' series, is both the theme and the operative plot
device in ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle,'' a fairly foolish and
fully overwrought Spanish film.
</P>
<P>
   Director Julio Medem harks back to the days when art movies
focused on beautiful scenery and even more beautiful young lovers.
He offers us Love! Valor! Passion! And enough fateful coincidences
to choke a horse.
</P>
<P>
   The lovers in question, Otto and Ana, have been running into
each other since they were kids. Recognizing that their names are
palindromes (spelled the same backward and forward), the pair
instantly decide that they're soul mates.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the picture, circumstances conspire to throw
them together and then tear them apart. And as the circle widens to
include others, the pileup of coincidences begins to look like a
bad day on I-285.
</P>
<P>
   As Otto and Ana, Fele Martinez and Najwa Nimri make a striking
couple. Martinez looks like every smolderingly sensitive European
protagonist you've ever seen, while Nimri has the big-eyed, fragile
beauty of someone who must've played Anne Frank before graduating
from drama school.
</P>
<P>
   The movie isn't tedious, just mildly irksome as it strives for
an outsized romanticism it never quite achieves. In an early scene,
Ana notes, ``There are no more good coincidences. It's my fault. I
used them too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fele Martinez and Najwa Nimri. Directed by Julio Medem.
Subtitles. Rated R for sex and language. At Garden Hills.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Goes in circles, and not always on purpose.

 &HT;    `Clock' argues for taking longer view of time
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May9.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are forever running out of time. We inventory it by multiples
of 10 _ the decades we peel away as if they were sections of a
tangerine _ but it is the seamless minutes and hours that slip by
unnoticed. The present evaporates with every second, receding
irretrievably into the past, and the future is reconfigured daily.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the year 2000. ``When I was a child,'' the computer
designer Daniel Hillis wrote a few years ago, ``people used to talk
about what would happen by the year 2000. Now, 30 years later, they
still talk about what will happen by the year 2000. The future has
been shrinking by one year per year for my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers high school Latin knows that tempus fugit.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Brand would like to slow it down _ or, rather, expand
our consciousness of it so that we are concerned less about the end
of a millennium and more about what might be called the eternal
present. ``The Clock of the Long Now'' is an anti-millennial book
in the sense that it argues for a reconsideration of how we
understand past, present and future.
</P>
<P>
   Brand is an environmentalist best known, perhaps, as the author
of ``The Whole Earth Catalog.'' But he is also a futurist and a bit
of a gadfly, trained as a biologist but interested in just about
everything. If anyone can say of the Internet that he was present
at the creation, or very soon after, Brand would qualify. He helped
found, in 1984, a computer teleconferencing system he called the
Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area,
the WELL was a computer bulletin board that anticipated what we
know today as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If that was the future in 1984, it is both future and present
that concern him today:
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilization is revving itself into a pathologically short
attention span. The trend might be coming from the acceleration of
technology, the short-horizon perspective of market-driven
economics, the next-election perspective of democracies, or the
distractions of personal multitasking. All are on the increase.
Some sort of balancing corrective to the short-sightedness is
needed _ some mechanism or myth that encourages the long view and
the taking of long-term responsibility, where `the long term' is
measured at least in centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to build a new clock, somewhere in the American desert,
and he wants it to keep time for 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a clock,'' he writes, ``if sufficiently impressive and
well engineered, would embody deep time for people. It would be
charismatic to visit, interesting to think about and famous enough
to become iconic in public discourse.'' It would be to the world
what Big Ben is to England. And, ideally, ``it would do for
thinking about time what the photographs of Earth from space have
done for thinking about the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   As both those passages might suggest, Brand thinks big better
than he thinks small (can an inanimate object be ``charismatic''?).
But it is the business of futurists not to worry overmuch about
undotted i's and uncrossed t's. They work with the capital letters,
and Brand, it has to be said, at least draws enough sense from them
that a determined Luddite like myself will grant him a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clock of the Long Now'' is by turns New Agey and quixotic,
contrary and provocative. But at its heart is a recognition that
technological revolutions (if that's what in fact they are) and
continuity are not incompatible: ``You need the space of continuity
to have the confidence not to be afraid of revolutions. You can
always improve things as long as you're prepared to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, waiting is not something we do well. We're better at
hurrying. We want things sooner rather than later. And we use time
more as a commodity than as a resource. Borrowing from James Carse,
a religion professor at New York University, Brand distinguishes
between finite and infinite games. A finite game, in Carse's words,
``is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the
purpose of continuing the game.'' Thus, as Brand writes,
``football, elections, and much of business are finite games:
win/lose. Family, gardening and spiritual practice are infinite
games: Losing is meaningless.'' What matters in finite games is not
how they end _ the score _ but how they continue.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, such an argument is not just uncongenial but
seditious. Life is about winning, not losing. Yet the real
objection has nothing to do with winning or losing. It's that time
is precious precisely because it is finite.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brand sees better than most of us one relationship
between time and consequence: ``Earthquakes, war, murder, the
burning of libraries . . . bad things happen fast. Reforestation,
the growth of a child, the maturing of an adult, building a library
. . . good things happen slow.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds overdramatic, it is no more so than our frantic
obsession with the immediate and the Right Now. We no sooner have
it securely in hand than we wonder where it went, and what we
really had.

JORDAN'S KING ASKING WEST TO CANCEL HALF NATION'S DEBT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Since his father's death propelled him to the
throne, King Abdullah of Jordan has been a man in motion. He has
installed a new government, moved to shore up his country's
troubled economy and scurried around the region to patch up
relations with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 37-year-old ruler is embarking on another trip, this one
to try to persuade Western governments to cancel $3.5 billion in
Jordan's obligations, fully half the country's debt. He said
Thursday that this was necessary to help Jordan, which has proved
pivotal to peace in the Middle East, become ``more stable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need Jordan to be strong so that we can shoulder our
responsibilities and be able to support the countries of the
region,'' Abdullah said over a long lunch with foreign journalists,
his first such interview since taking power.
</P>
<P>
   The king's focus on the economy represents a shift from that of
his father, King Hussein, who died on Feb. 7 and whose main
priority had been Middle East peace. But Abdullah spoke with both
candor and concern Thursday in suggesting that his country needed
more outside help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a crisis period,'' he said, but added, ``Time is
short.''
</P>
<P>
   With just 4 million people and few natural resources, Jordan
owes a staggering $7 billion to Western creditors, and its debt
payments now consume a quarter of its budget. Unemployment has
soared well into the double-digits, average incomes have plunged,
and diplomats say they worry that mounting social discontent could
make it difficult for Jordan to play its stabilizing role in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The king said he was not worried about domestic unrest. But as
he prepared to leave on Saturday for a journey that will take him
to Britain, Germany, Canada and the United States, he argued that
the combination of Jordan's problems and its strategic significance
meant that Western leaders would be prudent to halve its debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is we are keeping up our side of the
bargain,'' he said, referring to steps that Jordan has already
taken at the advice of the International Monetary Fund. ``We are
moving forward, we are moving according to the way you've advised
to do it. Please meet us halfway and help us to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah said he was grateful for steps already taken by the
Clinton administration, which canceled hundreds of millions of
Jordanian debt in 1994 after Hussein made peace with Israel and has
tripled its aid to Jordan in the last two years, to $700 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiving $3.5 billion in debt would be a much bigger step,
however. Most of it would have to be borne by the Europeans, who
are Jordan's biggest creditors, and some have sent mixed signals. A
British emissary, Derek Fatchett, said here this week that European
countries were ready to help ease Jordan's debt problems, but
Fatchett mentioned debt rescheduling, not debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was asked what would happen if the request was not met.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what cards are dealt,'' he answered, ``we will
persevere. But at what expense?''
</P>
<P>
   Since he inherited the throne, Abdullah has grown a beard, and
he has also grown in confidence, apparently as a result of his
rapid immersion into the world of statesmanship. He was named crown
prince in January, replacing the longtime official heir, Prince
Hassan, just days before his father's death from cancer. And having
made his career the military, Abdullah had never expected to become
king.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he had recognized that there was ``no time to
feel sorry for oneself'' or for the ``great loss of King Hussein,''
who died after 47 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to focus and get things together so that people could
feel secure, and move forward,'' he said, adding, ``I was always
told by my father, you get knocked down, you get right back up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another item in his conversations with Western leaders, Abdullah
said, will be policy toward Iraq, whose citizens' suffering under
the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait strikes angry nerves in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was outspoken in calling for a change in the Iraqi
government in the mid-1990s, but it retreated from that stance
under Hussein and, if anything, Abdullah seemed Thursday to back
further away. He said he believed that dialogue with Iraq might be
more productive than continued sanctions, and he vowed that Jordan
would play no role in any American-led efforts to topple the Iraqi
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Abdullah seemed determined to dispel any
impression that he has begun to turn his back on Israel. Jordan's
peace with Israel remains deeply unpopular here, but the king said
that, like his father, he was ``absolutely committed'' to it
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has been widely noticed in the Middle East that his
first foreign visits were to Arab countries, including Syria,
Libya, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have been
hostile toward Israel and have often criticized Jordan's separate
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want relationships with everybody, and I think we can do
that,'' the king insisted. But he also said that, in reaching out
to Arabs with whom relations have been cold, one of his motivations
had been to ``reassure our nationals, many of whom had worried that
Jordan might have severed too many Arab bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The king said he held out hope that Israel and the Palestinians
could quickly resume negotiations after the Israeli elections on
May 17. If there is momentum in those talks, he predicted, it might
well produce a ``cascade effect that could smooth over other
differences, including those between Israel and Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah has maintained a studied neutrality on the Israeli
elections. All three men seeking to become Israel's next prime
minister have visited Amman in recent weeks, and the king has held
a private meeting with each of them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no secret in Amman that Hussein had come to see Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader, as an obstacle
to a broader peace, and a slip of the tongue by Abdullah Thursday
seemed to suggest that he might prefer one of Netanyahu's two
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The king said he would be optimistic about peace ``if we have a
new face in Israel,'' and then he caught himself. What he had meant
to say, he insisted, was ``if we have a new phase.''

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing what they hope is new momentum for gun
control after Littleton, Colo., Senate Democrats on Thursday
unveiled a broad package of proposals that Republicans, though
skeptical, did not dismiss out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans will probably not allow discussion of all the
measures, from child safety locks on handguns to new regulations
for gun shows. However, the majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, has promised Democrats that they can offer a few gun
control amendments to a Republican juvenile justice bill. That bill
is scheduled for consideration early next week.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the first floor debate on gun control in either
chamber of Congress this year. Moreover, it should provide a
glimpse of how far apart the two parties stand, and whether the
battles lines have changed, following the shooting spree that left
15 people dead at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week will be, really, a great opportunity and a day of
reckoning,'' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Thursday at a
news conference at which he and five other Senate Democrats
announced eight amendments that Democrats wanted to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that the package of amendments, which closely
mirrored the gun control proposals that President Clinton announced
last week, was intended to ``maximize its impact on criminals and
children while minimizing its impact on law-abiding gun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have not indicated support for any of the
proposals, but neither have they clearly signaled an unyielding
opposition, a sign that the bloodshed at Columbine, and at other
schools before it, may have softened their stance or at least put
them on the political defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican aides said on Thursday that the atmosphere on
Capitol Hill had been altered and that Republican leaders were
reluctant to be portrayed as reflexively opposed to new gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that leaders were discussing whether there were a few
modest proposals they could support, but that they were also
questioning whether new laws would be any more effective in
reducing violence among children than more vigorous enforcement of
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lott expressed such skepticism earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if the solution or the prevention of this sort of
problem like we had in Colorado is necessarily more federal
legislation,'' he said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would support any of the proposals Democrats
had begun talking about, like tighter restrictions on the sales of
firearms at guns shows, Lott said, ``I sure do like gun shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and other Republicans have received more support and money
from the National Rifle Association than their Democratic
counterparts have. The rifle association generally opposes gun
control legislation, though a spokesman for the organization, Bill
Powers, said on Thursday that it would release its own set of
legislative proposals next week for reducing violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   That development, like Lott's promise to allow a debate on gun
control, reflected a sharp sensitivity right now to public opinion
about the issue. According to an Associated Press poll released on
Thursday, support for gun control has increased since Columbine,
though only 51 percent of Americans think new laws would be more
effective than better enforcement of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats are generally more enamored of gun control than
Republicans, the divide is not a clean one, and many Democrats in
Congress, including party leaders, have been tentative about
promoting the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic advocates of gun control intensified their public
relations campaign on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Democrats delineated their plans at a news conference
rife with charts, props and expressions of outrage, 31 female
Democratic members of the House sent the speaker, Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, a letter that looked forward to Mother's Day this weekend
and urged him to support gun control legislation as ``the greatest
gift we could give America's moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee had signaled
such eagerness to force a debate on gun control in a hearing
scheduled for Thursday on a juvenile justice bill that Republicans
on the committee postponed the event, according to several
Democratic and Republican aides.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals by Senate Democrats include the institution of a
three-day waiting period before handgun purchases; the closing of
loopholes that exempt gun shows and the Internet from regulations
governing the sale of firearms in stores; a ban on juvenile
possession of any assault weapons, and the imposition of criminal
penalties on adult gun owners whose children gain access to those
weapons and injure themselves or others.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said that measures like these
should not be overlooked as many Republicans and Democrats promote
a broader cultural debate about the causes of violence among
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with my colleagues who call for more guidance, more
prayer and more virtue,'' Durbin said. ``But I don't agree that
easy access to guns has nothing to do with this carnage.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin and other Senate Democrats said they had pared their wish
list of legislation, most of which represented minor tinkering as
opposed to massive overhaul, to proposals that had at least some
chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, when measures requiring child safety locks and
holding parents responsible for the misuse of their guns by
children came to the Senate floor, they were soundly defeated. In
addition, the juvenile justice bill to which such legislation might
be amended next week is by no means guaranteed to pass the Senate.

 &HT;    `Mummy' should have been kept under wraps
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because a movie has desert scenery, a hunky action hero,
hissable bad guys and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an
Indiana Jones movie. You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch
watching ``The Mummy,'' a petrified mix of retro adventure, clumsy
slapstick and minimal chills.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1932 Boris Karloff film, the movie sends adventurer
Brendan Fraser and Egyptologist Rachel Weisz in search of the
legendary, treasure-laden city of Hamunaptra. They're accompanied
by her brother John Hannah, and by a rival team of treasure-seekers
(four guys so expendable they might as well be tattooed ``Mummy's
Boys'').
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones who waken the corpse of high priest Imhotep, an
icky shell of computer-generated cartilage who replenishes his
flesh by sucking dry the dudes who woke him up. The movie gives us
acid booby traps, plagues of locusts and scarabs, and swell tidal
waves of sand. Some of the CGI effects are cool, but to see them
means wading through a script that reads like a first draft.
Thriller? Campy sendup? Promo reel for Industrial Light &AMP; Magic?
Stick around, ``The Mummy'' is always switching tones.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah survives. But in their rogue-and-schoolmarm roles, Fraser
doesn't have the rugged heft he needs, while Weisz turns in an
annoyingly ``cute'' performance befitting a community theater
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sommers wrote and directed ``The Mummy,'' so he deserves
double the blame for the lameness. He's also responsible for last
year's awful ``Deep Rising.'' Apparently the money guys at
Universal forgot to watch that movie before signing Sommers. Now
that's a real curse.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz. Rated PG-13 for pervasive
adventure violence and some partial nudity. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Mummy, make it stop!

US TIGHTENS IMMIGRATION SCREENING IN WAKE OF GLOBE REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service has
adopted tighter screening procedures to try to ensure that people
who participated in atrocities are not among the 20,000 Kosovo
refugees expected to arrive in the United States over the next
three months, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the changes were prompted by reports in a
Boston Globe series this week that suspected participants in ethnic
cleansing were recently allowed to settle in places such as
Everett, Mass. and Burlington, Vt., by portraying themselves as
victims of atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. Immigration
specialists involved in the immense US refugee program said that
the screening process had become easy for non-deserving immigrants
to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   INS officers interviewing Kosovo refugees in Macedonia have
received training to help them recognize members of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, Serb collaborators or criminals who may be
among the refugee population, US immigration officials said. The
government also has added a ``secondary'' layer of interviewers to
assist asylum officers who determine that a refugee applicant
should be questioned further.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they hope the changes will form the
basis for a new global policy for screening refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Globe series caused a closer look at what should be the
appropriate level of screening,'' said Dan Cadman, head of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's National Security Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legislators have called on the Clinton administration
to clarify how a broad range of suspected human rights offenders
have gained entry to the United States, as the Globe reported.
Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a Georgia Democrat, called for
hearings in an interview Thursday. Representative James McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat, sent a letter to Attorney General Janet
Reno wanting ``to know what transpired in these cases that allowed
these men to seek refuge in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, who has pushed
for the creation of a permanent international war crimes tribunal,
called the series ``troubling, to say the least.'' In a statement,
Dodd said the articles ``highlight a problem that needs to be
addressed. Our nation shouldn't send mixed signals with respect to
human rights. What we do is as important as what we say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we have a double standard when individuals with
questionable human rights records fall between the cracks and are
allowed to enter and remain in the US,'' said Dodd, whose father,
Thomas J. Dodd, worked as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mark Foley, a Republican from Port St. Lucie,
Fla., said he was shocked to learn that Carl Dorelien, a former
colonel in the murderous Haitian regime ousted by a 1994 US
invasion, has been living in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazes me is that nobody thought to notify us about the
potential of this guy being in our comunity,'' Foley said. ``We
seem to be fixated on Meghan's Law, and having sex offenders living
among us. I think it would be nice to know that this guy who
commanded 7,000 troops that led to the death of 5,000 people is
living next door to me. I mean, he's not the kind of guy that you'd
come over and bring a fruit basket to and say `Welcome to town.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, who has worked for several years on Salvadoran human
rights issues, said he has been stymied in his efforts to find out
why Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, a former Salvadoran general, was
allowed to settle in Palm Coast, Fla., despite the conclusion of a
UN Truth Commission that he participated in the coverup of the
massacre of four American churchwomen in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe series showed that the Salvadoran case is ``the tip of
the iceberg,'' McGovern said. `'I'm not so much interested in
assigning blame on how they got here. I just want them out. They
don't belong here. And this kind of subdued response from the
administration I think is just wrong. These people committed
horrendous atrocities and they belong in jail. They don't belong
anywhere near the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe documented the cases of three Bosnian refugees, two
living in New England, who allegedly participated in ethnic
cleansing operations in the former Yugoslavia. In each case, the
refugees apparently concealed their military backgrounds from
relief organizations involved in the ``pre-screening'' of refugees
and INS asylum officers who conducted interviews and made the
decision to grant refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   According to US immigration officials, the INS has been pushing
for changes in the refugee screening process. But the Globe's
findings helped propel the agency to implement changes immediately
at Fort Dix, N.J. and Macedonia, where about 20 asylum officers
have been sent to screen thousands of refugees, most of whom were
stripped of all identification before being driven from Kosovo by
the Serb army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, to its credit, we're very warmhearted and
welcoming people,'' said Cadman. ``And somtimes it just takes a
sober look to recognize that you can be both welcoming and
protective of your own people's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials cautioned that the changes were not foolproof and
still might not ensure that undeserving immigrants slip through the
cracks. ``There is no absolute failsafe, particularly in this
situation, where the Serbs deliberately stripped everyone of their
identities,'' said a US official, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes, asylum officers have received training in how
to better detect whether an applicant is concealing information or
lying about his past, US officials said. The officers also have
been instructed to ask a series of questions that would help elicit
whether an applicant may have participated in human rights abuses
or witnessed them and could provide useful information to war
crimes investigators.
</P>
<P>
   If an INS asylum officer questions a refugee's persecution
claim, the officer now can refer the case to another officer who
will investigate the claim's veracity, US officials said. Officials
said the secondary screening officers will interview the applicant
again and attempt to verify details about the claim.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said the officers are particularly concerned with
former members of the KLA, an organization that has been linked to
terrorism; Serb combatants and collaborators; and criminals who
have engaged in drug trafficking or alien and document smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the officers were focusing primarily on young
adult men. ``Generally we'll be looking at adult males who would be
considered of fighting age,'' said a US official. ``We are going to
want to know why they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fredriksson, associate executive director of Immigration
and Refugee Services of America, which is helping to implement the
Kosovo refugee program, said he was concerned that reports of
suspected participants in ethnic cleansing in the US might provoke
``an overreaction that could hurt a lot of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials said the changes were necessary to balance the
long-standing practice of the United States to accept tens of
thousands of refugees each year with the reality that the system
had become vulnerable to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refuge that we grant is a treasured thing,'' said one
immigration official. ``And it's the worst of all ironies if it
goes to someone who has inflicted pain and suffering on others and
caused them to seek refuge.''

AMERICAN STANDARD TURNS AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL MANAGEMENT
HIERARCHIES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carrie-Ann Houser was a year out of college when American
Standard Cos. hired her for an entry-level human resources job. A
couple of years later, her ``coach'' _ whose main job is
shepherding careers _ tapped her to revamp the way benefits are
administered. Scarcely a year later, she joined a
benefits-administration team.
</P>
<P>
   Her title never changed _ in fact, her business card has no
title _ but her responsibilities and salary rose steadily. ``In a
traditional setting I'd be waiting for someone to leave, and
clawing my way to their place,'' Ms. Houser said.
</P>
<P>
   American Standard, though, is far from traditional these days.
Yes, it makes plumbing supplies, air conditioners, truck brakes _
not things to get Internet-generation hearts pumping.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to Michael Hammer, the consultant in Cambridge,
Mass., who coined the term ``re-engineering'' and is the architect
of the ``process organization,'' which turns corporate hierarchies
on their ear. He sees American Standard as more avant-garde than
Silicon Valley companies that are long on promises of wealth but
short on job flexibility and career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to working with people, they are as different
from the traditional corporation as day is from night,'' Hammer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Look at American Standard business cards and that difference is
palpable. They list nebulous titles like process owner or group
leader _ or no titles at all. Even Emmanuel A. Kampouris has caught
the vague-title bug _ in the annual report, Mano Kampouris, 64, is
chairman, president and chief executive, but his card lists him
simply as corporate leader.
</P>
<P>
   And any number of once-high-ranking executives are now
``coaches,'' charged with guiding employees along career paths that
are not always easy to spot.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a simple transition, particularly for executives
who saw the perks and prestige they felt had rewarded their hard
work be ripped away. ``It has meant learning to manage our egos,
and accepting that we could learn as much from blue-collar workers
as from each other,'' Kampouris said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees own 25 percent of company stock, often in lieu of a
pension. Electronic flash boards, tallying orders and shipments,
are ubiquitous in the factories as well as in offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say that everyone is on the team, then you have to
communicate the same way to each one,'' said G. Eric Nutter, who
heads the domestic plumbing business.
</P>
<P>
   True, the news is not always good. American Standard's sales and
earnings are cyclical. The company carries heavy debt, and its
stock is a so-so performer, so it cannot just buy other companies
as a hedge. The few acquisitions it has made are not helping much.
</P>
<P>
   But it is seemingly mundane stories like Carrie-Ann Houser's
that mark the real change at American Standard, based in
Piscataway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, when it went public for the second time, it had already
put in place ``demand flow'' technology, a way of rearranging
equipment and retraining factory workers that speeds orders along,
resulting in fewer products eating up working capital in inventory.
The logical next step was to streamline the operations before,
after and around the time a product is made.
</P>
<P>
   Process organization regroups everyone, from bosses to hourly
workers, into teams headed by ``process owners.'' Then, instead of
letting different departments handle budgeting, staffing, accounts
receivable, and other aspects of an order or assignment, it lets
each team take the project from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   This can be an angst-filled cultural change. For managers, it
means the death of fancy titles, big offices, power over
subordinates, all the ego trappings of corporate success. And for
up-and-comers, it means a promotional path that is fuzzy at best.
</P>
<P>
   So three years ago American Standard turned to coaching. Today,
it has 278 people, many of whom once had fancy titles, who act as
mentors to about 100 employees each, and it expects to have 300
coaches by summer. The coaches catalog their proteges' skills and
interests, find them training to shore up weak spots and move them
along fast enough to avoid boredom but slowly enough to prevent
overload.
</P>
<P>
   In salary and prestige, these coaches, who as a group cost more
than $33 million a year, are on a par with process owners; but they
are judged not by how well they churn out products or rake in
dollars, but by how well the Carrie-Ann Housers move along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process owners worry about customers, while the coaches
worry about our people,'' explained Helmut Sander, who coaches the
coaches at Wabco, American Standard's Brussels-based auto-products
group. Andrew Stevenson, a business leader at Trane, the company's
air-conditioning business, based in Trenton, N.J., put it more
simply: ``Coaches are guidance counselors who help us move around,
not just up.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of coaching's handiwork abound:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ray Helmich, an engineering coach, guided a shop foreman who
enjoyed working with computers to a better job in information
technology. ``He only had a high school degree, so no one would
have recruited him,'' Helmich said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane Notta was an obscure finance department employee when
her coach pushed her to brush up her customer-service skills and
apply for the post she now holds shepherding customer orders at
Trane. ``This job would have seemed beyond my comfort zone if my
coach hadn't led me through each step,'' Ms. Notta said.
</P>
<P>
   _ James M. Freeman, an accounting team leader in plumbing, had
an idea for saving on lighting costs. ``Everyone's reaction was,
`What does an accountant know about lighting?' '' he recalled. His
coach tutored him on how to present his case better, and he got the
go-ahead to spend $135,000 on energy-saving bulbs. ``The incident
will help my career,'' Freeman said. ``It showed my tenacity.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fast-tracking people has not kept American Standard from
missteps. A few years ago it bought a money-losing medical
diagnostics company that Roger W. Parsons, managing director of the
British merchant bank Rea Brothers Group and an American Standard
director, acknowledges ``was not one of our best moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Many shareholders were disappointed when in January 1997 the
company rejected a $50-a-share acquisition bid from Tyco
International, when American Standard was trading in the low $40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been good, considering the premium and how
aggressive a cost cutter Tyco can be,'' said Sholom Dinsky, a
managing director at Prudential Investments, who still has a hefty
chunk of American Standard stock in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to wring costs out of its plumbing business, which has
been hard hit overseas, resulted in such hefty write-offs that the
company lost $117 million in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And its February purchase of the bathroom products division of
Blue Circle Industries, which Kampouris insists gives American
Standard invaluable distribution in Europe, prompted many analysts
to downgrade their recommendations on the stock to neutral at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is surprising that they are allocating such a large amount
of capital to their lowest-return business,'' David J. Pizzimenti
of Schroder &AMP; Co. wrote in a February report.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American Standard ended last year with sales up 11
percent, to $6.7 billion, and net income up 4 percent, to $637
million. And it had working capital down to 2.9 percent of sales,
from 4.7 percent in 1997. First-quarter results were rosy, too,
with net income at $47 million, up 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they see something wrong, they quickly take steps,'' said
Michael Jaffe, an analyst with S.&AMP; P, Equity Group.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kampouris, whose twinkling eyes and informal manner
belie a steely resolve, keeps raising the bar. That habit exacts
both admiration and annoyance from the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons remembers Kampouris handing out badges with the letters
TNE on them. ``They stood for `twice net earnings,' one of Mano's
goals,'' Parsons recalled. ``His people took them to mean
`terrific, not enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kampouris can perhaps be forgiven for pushing hard. Ten years
ago a botched management buyout left American Standard essentially
comatose, trying to service $3 billion in debt on $3.6 billion in
sales. Kampouris, who has been with the company 34 years and was a
leader of the buyout, took over as chief executive, and began
hacking costs and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognized that if you can get the senior people to change
their mind-set, the junior people will come along,'' said Ram
Charan, a Dallas management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching system, of course, has been part and parcel of that
one-for-all approach. ``Coaching was a good way to find jobs for
people who might have been downsized and a great way to utilize
people who care less about their outside status than about their
internal sphere of influence,'' Kampouris said.
</P>
<P>
   Many managers could not do that and left or were reassigned.
Others identified so thoroughly with their charges that they would
insist on third, fourth, ninth chances for people who eventually
had to be dismissed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But a highly visible few embraced the chance to coach. David R.
Pannier was vice president for marketing at Unitary Products, which
makes small air-conditioners, when the new structure went into
place. He immediately volunteered as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a manager has seven things to do, developing people
always winds up the seventh,'' he said. ``Well, I had 20 years of
sales and marketing experience, and I was ready to use it to
develop people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kampouris uses both the carrot and the stick to make the system
work. Coaches whose people make good progress get nice bonuses and
eventual promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Pannier, for one, spent less than two years as a coach before he
was made group leader of Unitary Products. It was a similarly short
hop for Gary Uhl, an industrial engineer-cum-plumbing products
sales coach, to his current job as a process owner in the plumbing
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about customers and sales, and that increased my own
skills level,'' Uhl said.
</P>
<P>
   But woe to any manager who fails to embrace the spirit of
coaching and the process organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, who periodically visits American Standard outposts to
audit their progress, reported back that senior managers at one
overseas branch were not relinquishing authority to the process
teams. Kampouris dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmanuel Kampouris is mild mannered, he's courtly and
delightful and kind,'' Hammer said. ``But if you're being
halfhearted or insincere, you don't want to be on the receiving end
of his evaluation.'' &QL;

SERBIAN PERSECUTION UNITES TWO STRANGERS IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DIX, New Jersey _ Mirsade Bejiqi and Arlinda Gashi were not
friends at home in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. Nor did they
meet on the trains on which they fled from Serbs, who were
persecuting them for their Albanian Muslim ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday they stood together like young women who'd known
each other forever, trying simultaneously to face a new life in
America and to keep alive the memory of their homeland in the
Balkans. They were the first of the group of 453 refugees who
arrived here Wednesday to talk about their dreams, and their
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very tired (on arrival), but for us it was like we
were born again,'' said Bejiqi, 20. ``Our minds were so confused
with what we'd left, what we'd seen there.... We went through
everything, and now it seems there is another view of life.''
</P>
<P>
   As she and Gashi, 19, talked with the first journalists allowed
to meet with refugees, the fenced-in compound in which they are
being held for interviewing and processing by immigration and
public-health officials pulsed with energy and echoed with the
joyous shrieks of children at play _ an Albanian version of
dodge-ball, soccer, or paratrooper-assisted baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The young women were upbeat, riding a wave of relief at being
out danger. They were clean, well-fed, and rested to boot. But
their attitudes were not the same. Bejiqi looked more to the
future; Gashi _ perhaps because her experience at the hands of the
Serbs was more severe _ kept looking back.
</P>
<P>
   Already she had seen relatives severely beaten and a schoolmate
killed when, nine nights after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia in the
so-far-unsuccessful effort to stop expulsion and displacement of
ethnic Albanians, ``the police came in our house and said go out,''
Gashi said.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded 5,000 German marks, she said, and ``we said, `Kill
us. We don't got.' They said give us 500 and go.'' With a loan from
some cousins, that is what she, her parents, and her brother did.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, Bejiqi, her parents, and two brothers, who had
been hiding in cellars in downtown Pristina, also entrained after,
she said, ``there came a mass of people _ not soldiers, Serbian
people _ and told us to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew where they were going. Everyone wound up in an open
field in Blace, the no-man's-land at the Macedonian border where,
incredibly, life got worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day it rained,'' Bejiqi said. ``People were dying day
and night, and many children were born.''
</P>
<P>
   Both families were in the first masses of refugees moved to
NATO-run camps in Macedonia, both were among the first to volunteer
for evacuation, even if that meant transfer to the American
military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a signal that these were people who were prepared to
make the break,'' said Roger Winter, director of the
non-governmental Immigration and Refugee Services of America, the
lead refugee resettlement organization. ``They valued their own
lives and the lives of their children, and they were prepared to
make the leap.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, both girls are intent on returning to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to come here, in America. It was my dream,
what I answered when they asked in school where did I want to go,''
Bejiqi said. ``But it is important to go back. Albanian people do
not want to live outside Kosovo. It's ours. We built it.... We will
rebuild it. No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Servicemen and women attending to the refugees' needs said that,
jet lag notwithstanding, many rose early Thursday to look around _
and eat. While only cold turkey sandwiches and snacks were
available Wednesday night, Thursday three hot meals were provided
by the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and bananas led the initial list of favorite foods,
followed by ``any kind of bread that isn't white,'' said Capt. Ron
Frame, a supply officer. Lima beans and mashed potatoes were
least-liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not asking for anything,'' said Staff Sgt. Terry Wade,
whose unit flew in from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to assist the
refugees. ``They are putting their hands out, asking, `Can we sweep
the floors? Can we do anything to help?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As America's newest residents ate, played, and napped, still
under tight Immigration and Naturalization Service control,
government and private-agency officials offered sometimes-differing
views on whether they had been screened for political and military
involvements before leaving Macedonia, and whether all would be
able to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Lavinia Limon, director of refugee resettlement for the US
Department of Health and Human Services, the lead government agency
in the Fort Dix program, said that the refugees were all evaluated
and found eligible for asylum before leaving Macedonia, a view
echoed by a State Department refugee program official.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for the US Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said in response to questions from The
Globe: ``The processing done over there is really very skeletal.
The interviewers (here) are pretty skilled at ferreting out
(indications of unacceptable military or political activity) but we
do have to rely heavily on what they tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   The US screening procedures did not concern the young people who
made up about half the first group of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to say thanks to everyone,'' said Bejiqi. ``I
especially want to thank American people. They help us a lot.''

US TIGHTENS IMMIGRATION SCREENING IN WAKE OF GLOBE REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service has
adopted tighter screening procedures to try to ensure that people
who participated in atrocities are not among the 20,000 Kosovo
refugees expected to arrive in the United States over the next
three months, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the changes were prompted by reports in a
Boston Globe series this week that suspected participants in ethnic
cleansing were recently allowed to settle in places such as
Everett, Mass. and Burlington, Vt., by portraying themselves as
victims of atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. Immigration
specialists involved in the immense US refugee program said that
the screening process had become easy for non-deserving immigrants
to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   INS officers interviewing Kosovo refugees in Macedonia have
received training to help them recognize members of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, Serb collaborators or criminals who may be
among the refugee population, US immigration officials said. The
government also has added a ``secondary'' layer of interviewers to
assist asylum officers who determine that a refugee applicant
should be questioned further.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they hope the changes will form the
basis for a new global policy for screening refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Globe series caused a closer look at what should be the
appropriate level of screening,'' said Dan Cadman, head of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's National Security Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legislators have called on the Clinton administration
to clarify how a broad range of suspected human rights offenders
have gained entry to the United States, as the Globe reported.
Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a Georgia Democrat, called for
hearings in an interview Thursday. Representative James McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat, sent a letter to Attorney General Janet
Reno wanting ``to know what transpired in these cases that allowed
these men to seek refuge in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, who has pushed
for the creation of a permanent international war crimes tribunal,
called the series ``troubling, to say the least.'' In a statement,
Dodd said the articles ``highlight a problem that needs to be
addressed. Our nation shouldn't send mixed signals with respect to
human rights. What we do is as important as what we say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we have a double standard when individuals with
questionable human rights records fall between the cracks and are
allowed to enter and remain in the US,'' said Dodd, whose father,
Thomas J. Dodd, worked as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mark Foley, a Republican from Port St. Lucie,
Fla., said he was shocked to learn that Carl Dorelien, a former
colonel in the murderous Haitian regime ousted by a 1994 US
invasion, has been living in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazes me is that nobody thought to notify us about the
potential of this guy being in our comunity,'' Foley said. ``We
seem to be fixated on Meghan's Law, and having sex offenders living
among us. I think it would be nice to know that this guy who
commanded 7,000 troops that led to the death of 5,000 people is
living next door to me. I mean, he's not the kind of guy that you'd
come over and bring a fruit basket to and say `Welcome to town.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, who has worked for several years on Salvadoran human
rights issues, said he has been stymied in his efforts to find out
why Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, a former Salvadoran general, was
allowed to settle in Palm Coast, Fla., despite the conclusion of a
UN Truth Commission that he participated in the coverup of the
massacre of four American churchwomen in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe series showed that the Salvadoran case is ``the tip of
the iceberg,'' McGovern said. `'I'm not so much interested in
assigning blame on how they got here. I just want them out. They
don't belong here. And this kind of subdued response from the
administration I think is just wrong. These people committed
horrendous atrocities and they belong in jail. They don't belong
anywhere near the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe documented the cases of three Bosnian refugees, two
living in New England, who allegedly participated in ethnic
cleansing operations in the former Yugoslavia. In each case, the
refugees apparently concealed their military backgrounds from
relief organizations involved in the ``pre-screening'' of refugees
and INS asylum officers who conducted interviews and made the
decision to grant refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   According to US immigration officials, the INS has been pushing
for changes in the refugee screening process. But the Globe's
findings helped propel the agency to implement changes immediately
at Fort Dix, N.J. and Macedonia, where about 20 asylum officers
have been sent to screen thousands of refugees, most of whom were
stripped of all identification before being driven from Kosovo by
the Serb army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, to its credit, we're very warmhearted and
welcoming people,'' said Cadman. ``And somtimes it just takes a
sober look to recognize that you can be both welcoming and
protective of your own people's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials cautioned that the changes were not foolproof and
still might not ensure that undeserving immigrants slip through the
cracks. ``There is no absolute failsafe, particularly in this
situation, where the Serbs deliberately stripped everyone of their
identities,'' said a US official, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes, asylum officers have received training in how
to better detect whether an applicant is concealing information or
lying about his past, US officials said. The officers also have
been instructed to ask a series of questions that would help elicit
whether an applicant may have participated in human rights abuses
or witnessed them and could provide useful information to war
crimes investigators.
</P>
<P>
   If an INS asylum officer questions a refugee's persecution
claim, the officer now can refer the case to another officer who
will investigate the claim's veracity, US officials said. Officials
said the secondary screening officers will interview the applicant
again and attempt to verify details about the claim.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said the officers are particularly concerned with
former members of the KLA, an organization that has been linked to
terrorism; Serb combatants and collaborators; and criminals who
have engaged in drug trafficking or alien and document smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the officers were focusing primarily on young
adult men. ``Generally we'll be looking at adult males who would be
considered of fighting age,'' said a US official. ``We are going to
want to know why they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fredriksson, associate executive director of Immigration
and Refugee Services of America, which is helping to implement the
Kosovo refugee program, said he was concerned that reports of
suspected participants in ethnic cleansing in the US might provoke
``an overreaction that could hurt a lot of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials said the changes were necessary to balance the
long-standing practice of the United States to accept tens of
thousands of refugees each year with the reality that the system
had become vulnerable to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refuge that we grant is a treasured thing,'' said one
immigration official. ``And it's the worst of all ironies if it
goes to someone who has inflicted pain and suffering on others and
caused them to seek refuge.''

ON-LINE GROUP ORGANIZES UNIQUE AID FOR REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many other concerned citizens, Douglas P. Williams has been
haunted by the images of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, limping
across the border with empty hands and empty eyes. From his home in
Boston, Williams felt there must be something he could do to help,
so shortly after he began hearing reports of atrocities in the
Balkans, he contacted more than a dozen aid organizations working
in the area and offered to volunteer. He was turned down by all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for medical help,'' said Williams, 27, a
marketing professional who is between jobs. ``Or they only relied
on experienced volunteers. It was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he came upon a group on the Internet called the Balkan
Sunflowers, and he found his calling. He's now working as the US
coordinator for the grass-roots organization and receives 70
e-mails a day from kindred spirits nationwide. He will join other
Sunflower volunteers in Albania or Macedonia early next month to
work in the refugee camps. The group, organized exclusively on the
Web, has already amassed volunteers working in 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to supplement the essentials provided by traditional
humanitarian groups. The Red Cross, for instance, distributes food
for the body; the Balkan Sunflowers offers sustenance for the soul,
organizing schools and play groups, arts projects and sports
events, self-help groups and cottage industries.
</P>
<P>
   The unique effort was launched by Wam Kat, a Dutch sociologist
who has spent seven years promoting nonviolent conflict resolution
in Eastern Europe. In 1992, he traveled to Zagreb, a city divided
by the war between the Croats and the Serbs. UN peacekeeping forces
had occupied Zagreb, and the streets were littered with sandbags
used to shore up antiartillery shelters all over the city. Kat
planted sunflower seeds in the sandbags, and when the plants
blossomed, the flowers became a symbol of hope and the metaphor for
Kat's humanitarian work.
</P>
<P>
   Kat, 43, spearheaded SunCokret (Croatian for sunflower), a
grass-roots organization made up of 5,000 international volunteers
who helped rebuild the Croatian town of Pakrac, among other
projects. Members of the group came from all over the globe, from
South Africa to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of empowering people to say, `OK, there is a way
we can help even if we are not trained in special situations,' ''
Kat said from Germany, just before he set off for Albania to set up
the Sunflower office there. ``This is about the emotions of normal
people who are saying, `This is not human. We should start acting.'
You could say that professionals have to do this job, but I think
it should just be humans doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanja Nikolic is one of those humans. Born in a small town in
Croatia, she was a student in Zagreb when SunCokret sprouted. ``I
am not a statement-writing or demonstrations against war or
peace-marching sort of activist,'' she said. ``I love concrete,
grass-roots, practical and creative types of work.'' Since working
with the Sunflower efforts, she is now a full-time activist at the
Center for Peace Studies in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Though its 1992 creation was two years before the invention of
the Web, news of Sunflower's work spread worldwide when Kat
published his Zagreb diary on electronic bulletin boards. The group
caught the attention of Vice President Al Gore, who applauded it in
a 1994 speech about global communication. ``After reading Kat's
Croatian diary, people around the world began to send money for
relief efforts,'' Gore said. ``The result: 25 houses have been
built in a town destroyed by war. Governments didn't do this.
People did. But such events are the hope of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who took action is Sinisa Slijepcevic, who was a
21-year old math major at the University of Zagreb in 1992. He
spent six months working with children in Sadudrija, a refugee camp
in Croatia near the Italian border. ``Most of my friends went to
fight, but I was lucky enough not to have to go,'' said
Slijepcevic, now a doctoral student at the Cambridge University.
``But I couldn't just stay home and not do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also recruited former Croatian soldiers to its cause.
``I would run into them and say, `You are perfect for running a
children's garden,' '' Kat recalled. ``They would say, `You are a
fool. I am a soldier.' But they actually learned to do it, and some
of them stayed working with children and became very good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan Sunflowers will attempt to plant such gardens in
refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia, working to improve quality
of life for the refugees once their essential needs have been met
by the traditional aid operations. The group emphasizes that its
work is not about rescue efforts; it is about relieving the
monotony of life in the refugee camps and establishing a sense of
normalcy under abnormal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this kind of work if you want to change the world
or solve other people's problems,'' said Kees Driessen, a Dutch
psychology student who volunteered in 1992 and will travel to the
camps later this year. ``It's about simple things such as
organizing a Christmas party . . . or learning to make something,
painting for the first time in your life, acting in some small
play. It's not feeding my soul but feeding their brains with
something other than misery and dread.''
</P>
<P>
   Driessen, like other volunteers, was untrained but motivated
when he joined the group. Volunteers receive about a week's worth
of training before they go into the field for stays of three weeks.
Kat and his colleagues are planning the training sessions now, in
addition to setting up field offices in Skopje and Tirana and
connecting with such established groups as the International Rescue
Committee and the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
which supported their work during the Croatian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Kat is treading carefully as he does the groundwork for the
volunteers. ``We are not naive,'' he said. ``We're not saying,
`Just get on an airplane and come.' There is enough chaos going on,
and we have to try to find a way to help rather than create more
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams and the US volunteers make their sojourn next
month, they will live in the same conditions as the refugees.
Brought together by sophisticated technology, they will work
together in primitive conditions. ``The camps are hell,'' recalled
Slijepcevic, who plans to volunteer again once he submits his
doctoral thesis in June.
</P>
<P>
   But for the members of this unusual cyber group, the experience
has changed their lives. ``It brought war, the effects of war,
closer to home, but it also brought it down to earth,'' said
Driessen. ``It all comes down to this: War is simple, peace is
difficult. And as soon as the fighting stops, the struggle for
peace begins.''

ISRAELI HOPEFULS TURN TO AMERICANS TO SHAPE CANDIDACIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With Pizza Hut and McDonald's ubiquitous across the
Israeli landscape, it should come as no surprise that this country
has imported another franchise: American-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   The result, familiar to Americans but a rude awakening for
Israelis, has been a diet of political fast food that puts sound
bites over substance, shock over complexity, and winning over
governing.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel heads into the final stretch of a too-close-to-call
campaign for prime minister, the messages of the leading candidates
are being shaped by two of America's most influential Washington
insiders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party
has again hired the reclusive conservative political strategist
Arthur Finkelstein, while challenger Ehud Barak's Labor Party has
brought in liberal pitbull James Carville.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel is not America, especially when it comes to the
issues voters face. In the May 17 election, the issues are: the
fate of the peace process and the redrawing of Israeli-Palestinian
borders, the battle for the soul of Israel as a secular democracy
or a religious state, the deep cultural divides among Israel's
ethnic groups, and a flagging economy that threatens its future.
Overriding these themes is an even more primal concern of security
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With such daunting challenges before them, many voters,
political analysts, and even insiders in the campaigns are alarmed
that Israel's electoral debate _ always vitriolic but rarely
lacking substance _ has been reduced to an American brand of slick
TV marketing, attack ads, focus groups, and relentless polling.
</P>
<P>
   In the run up to the May 17 election, Finkelstein, who used
skills honed in Washington to bring Likud to victory in 1996, flew
in last weekend from his horse farm in Ipswich, Mass. and is
running Likud's ``war room'' at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's choice, Carville, whose ferocity couched in a Cajun
drawl helped bring President Clinton to the White House in 1992, is
the leader of an American trio of advisers trying to clinch the
election for Labor. For now, he is still advising from Washington,
but has been visiting Israel on and off for months to focus Labor's
message and unleash his trademark tirades on talkshows.
</P>
<P>
   A third important candidate, Yitzhak Mordechai of the new Center
Party, has not retained any American consultants, his staff says,
primarily because they cannot afford them. Despite early excitement
about his prospects, polls show Mordechai slipping dramatically,
while the race between Netanyahu and Barak remains neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-paced, no-holds-barred political style imported by
Finkelstein and Carville, critics argue, has encouraged candidates
to obscure their views on seminal issues in favor of a battle over
personalities, trivializing Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli politics has always been tough, but never trivial. The
fact that it is less focused on the issues may be nothing new for
Americans, but it is utterly foreign to us,'' said Leslie Susser,
who covers politics for The Jerusalem Report, an English-language
magazine that targets Israeli and American Jews. ``And it couldn't
have come at a worse moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The images in the parties' television campaign ads are the
battleground in this election, which almost certainly will have to
be settled in the June 1 run-off.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, beginning to trail Barak by as much as 8 percent in
polls taken over the last two days, has stepped up his television
ad campaign of fear, a classically Finkelstein approach. One
searing image is of a burning bus in the aftermath of a suicide
bombing in 1996 by the Islamic resistance movement Hamas, while a
narrator, speaking over the sirens and screams, asks voters,
``Remember this?'' His use of these images is credited with winning
Netanyahu the 1996 election, by less than one percent, over
then-Labor Party leader Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   This year Netanyahu's party has also focused on the emotionally
charged issue of Jerusalem, whose final status is yet to be debated
under the terms of the 1993 Oslo peace accord. Israel sees the city
as its indivisible and eternal capital, but the Palestinian
leadership sees East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied after the
1967 Six Day War, as the capital of a future state. In one ad,
Netanyahu shows Jews praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old
City. In reality there are no flags at the wall, but the ad shows
Israeli flags, until the sky darkens and the camera pans up to show
them replaced by Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's Barak faces the challenge of convincing voters that he,
too, will be tough on terrorism, but that Netanyahu is ``stuck,''
as Barak often puts it, and unable to move a deadlocked peace
process forward. After close scrutiny of focus groups and polls by
Carville and two other American advisers, Bob Shrum and Stanley
Greenberg, Barak seems to have constructed a policy on the peace
process that is nearly indistinguishable from Netanyahu's. He, too,
insists that the future of Jerusalem is ``non-negotiable'' and
fosters an image of toughness by trumpeting his career as a
distinguished army general.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is also using attacks ads. One features ominous shots of
Netanyahu winking to a far-right Cabinet minister who was indicted
on fraud charges. In another, haunting music creeps in over a
scowling Netanyahu, followed by a graphic of rising unemployment as
a narrator asks, ``A hundred thousand people lost their jobs, why
should he keep his?''
</P>
<P>
   Television ads, restricted to only three weeks before the
election, are broadcast nightly in two, half-hour blocks. Most are
a minute or less, and time is allocated based on each party's
representation in the Knesset, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   This is a unique, almost quaint, Israeli political tradition,
and many analysts saw it as a solid format for debate. Since the
mid-1970S, Israelis gathered around the television to watch focused
explanations of each party's positions. The next day, the parties
would respond to each other or perhaps deepen their message. Visual
techniques were crude, mostly talking heads and a clear focus on
the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Although American political advisers have come and gone in
elections here since at least 1981, when Prime Minister Menachem
Begin hired David Garth, their presence was previously low key and
they operated within this Israeli style of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1996, when Israel shifted to direct
elections for prime minister. Before that, voters had chosen a
political party, which nominated its leader and clumsily
constructed political platforms. In 1996, Netanyahu hired
Finklestein and almost overnight changed Israeli political
discourse by focusing on key issues and personalizing the debate.
He was the first to shorten the ads to 20-second visual blasts with
a slogan of only several words, such as ``Peace with security.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, ads for both parties are a rush of images.
Sentences are short and declarative. The message is simple. For
Netanyahu, it's security. For Barak, it's the economy. The
graphics, the quick cuts, the music, the mood are as American as
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Yaron Ezrahi, a professor of political science at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, said, ``It is utterly unprecedented that
the most salient issue of this campaign is the campaign itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is discussing the Americanization of our politics,
and mourning the fact that it comes just as we face monumental and
historic decisions about peace and war and borders,'' he added.
``We are a society whose identity is still in a formative phase and
we end up being brought to the ballot box by Americans whose
expertise is in how to divert the attention from the performance of
the leaders they represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those directly involved are wary. David Bar-Illan, a
spokesman for Netanyahu who used to write a scathing weekly column
on foreign media coverage of Israel for the Jerusalem Post, is
among them. Even though Netanyahu is credited with starting the
trend, Bar-Illan believes that this time, it works against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency of the American system is to concentrate on
personalities, which does not work to his adavantage,'' explained
Bar-Illan. ``The concentration on policies would be more to his
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan and others are also quick to assign some of the blame
for the downward spiral of political debate to the Israeli media.
Ehud Ya'ari, Israel's top TV political commentator who has also
been a correspondent in Washington, admits the media hold some
resonsibility for getting caught in Finkelstein and Carville's spin
cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that Finkelestein and Carville do not understand
the nuances of Israeli politics,'' he said. ``We should be more
vigilant in not allowing them to set the agenda. There is too much
at stake here to let that happen.''

INSURERS AGREE TO PAY CLAIMS ON PRE-HOLOCAUST POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Several large European insurance companies agreed for
the first time Thursday to pay claims on policies bought by
European Jews before the Holocaust, under a formula that reflects
present-day values. The settlement could potentially result in
billions of dollars in payments.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the agreement, reached after two days of
rancorous negotiations in London, were not released, and the
insurers declined to comment on them. But the broad outlines of the
agreement were announced by the World Jewish Congress, which
participated in the negotiations, and Lawrence Eagleburger, the
former secretary of state who is chairman of the committee that has
been conducting the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was seen as a significant breakthrough on an issue
haunting Europe more than 50 years after World War II. It is the
latest unfolding of an effort that began more than three years ago
to secure financial reparations from Swiss banks for survivors of
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the effort, led by American Jewish groups, senior
U.S. officials and American lawyers, has mushroomed to encompass
claims against European insurance companies and German corporations
accused of employing slave labor. Just Wednesday, for example,
Volkswagen was sued in the United States on behalf of former Polish
and Russian slave laborers who claim their children died in a
decrepit nursery run by the German automaker during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the insurers is significantly different from
other settlements of Holocaust claims because it takes into account
a half-century of inflation, interest payments and currency
depreciation, which could drastically magnify the size of payouts.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for devising the exact amount of payments has not
been worked out yet, but estimates of total payouts have ranged
from $1 billion to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger will lead a separate committee to resolve the value
of the policies before negotiations resume in Jerusalem next month.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on the agreement by Eagleburger did not say how
claims would be verified. But it said he had instructed his staff
to ``establish the claims process and begin work on the outreach
process necessary to inform potential insurance claimants that they
can file claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
said the insurance companies agreed to make the payments only after
Eagleburger threatened to go public and ``tell the truth'' that
negotiations were a failure due to the insurers' intransigence. The
insurance companies at the negotiations are some of the biggest in
the industry: Allianz AG of Germany, AXA of France, Assicurazioni
Generali of Italy, Winterthur of Switzerland and Anglo-Swiss Zurich
Financial Services. Many other European insurance companies are not
party to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were thousands _ possibly many more _ of life and other
insurance policies taken out in prewar Europe by Jews who later
died or suffered under the Holocaust. For decades after the war,
insurance companies avoided paying out on the policies, arguing in
some cases that, since their Eastern European subsidiaries had been
nationalized by communist governments in the postwar era, they were
not responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But, more recently, regulators in the United States, notably in
California, put pressure on the European insurers. California
threatened to suspend the business licenses of more than 100
European insurers unless they moved to settle with claimants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, after the first day of negotiations,
Steinberg said that the talks were stalled on many issues,
including the policy values and the insurance company
nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after a second day of discussions, Steinberg said,
``the rabbit was pulled from the hat'' after Eagleburger told
insurance company negotiators that he would disclose their attitude
to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Until all of the details are worked out, Steinberg said, the
insurance companies agreed to make what he called ``fast-track''
payments to some of the thousands of aging people with direct
claims on the policies. In addition, he said, the companies agreed
to assume responsibility for policies predating the postwar
nationalization of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nationalization issue was resolved only five minutes after
the talks ended. It was that dramatic,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said Thursday's agreement was unlikely to eat
significantly into the European insurance companies' huge holdings.
But, some analysts said, the companies may have feared setting a
precedent that would be used by American lawyers who won a
billion-dollar settlement from Swiss banks and are also pursuing
class-action suits against German companies that employed slave
labor. In that case the issue of the value of wartime money
translated into 1999 terms would assume significance because the
German government has already paid some claims that Jewish groups
now consider to be too low.
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger is to meet Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, along with
Israel Singer of the World Jewish Congress, next week to discuss
that issue.

DELIVERING ITS TECHNOLOGICAL DREAM POSES HUGE CHALLENGES FOR AT&AMP;T 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also AT&AMP;T-MICROSOFT) 
 (rm) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a series of deals over the last year that culminated in its
agreement this week to acquire Mediaone Group Inc., AT&AMP;T Corp. has
committed itself to spending more than $90 billion on a
technological vision that is largely untested and that may not
exist anywhere on but AT&AMP;T's drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   The promise is great: a system that could allow AT&AMP;T to provide
competition against Baby Bells in local phone markets through cable
connections _ even while delivering interactive television, which
could allow viewers to select their own camera angles or replays,
and lightning-quick Internet access to households more accustomed
to molasses-like speeds.
</P>
<P>
   But the technical and organizational challenges standing between
that vision and AT&AMP;T's present are so great that one AT&AMP;T executive
likened AT&AMP;T's ambitions to launching a space station. It is one of
the most grand technical voyages in communications since the old Ma
Bell starting stringing telephone wires across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to figure out how to build it, how to deploy it, how
to support it, how to maintain it,'' C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman, said Thursday in an interview. Referring to new
customers, he added: ``The issue is not doing this for a few
hundred people a month. It's for tens of thousands of people a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, AT&AMP;T enlisted Microsoft Corp., the leviathan of
software, to help in that effort. As expected, Microsoft agreed to
invest $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, while AT&AMP;T agreed to use Microsoft's
software in some of the advanced television set-top boxes that AT&AMP;T
plans to use to bring its vision into living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the $90 billion that AT&AMP;T has already committed to its
vision is just to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. in a deal that
was announced last summer, and MediaOne, in an agreement formalized
Thursday. Now billions more must be spent turning relatively raw
assets into systems that can deliver the dream.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take years for most people, even those in
AT&AMP;T's cable markets, to see tangible results of the company's
ambitions. And it is not clear if customers will end up footing the
bill, though AT&AMP;T is well aware that its pricing will have to
undercut local telephone incumbents if it is to have much chance of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, the main technical challenge for AT&AMP;T is to get
cable television networks to do things that they were never meant
to.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional cable networks are well suited for their original
job: transmitting television images. Cable networks have very high
capacities for information; a cable subscriber's home is generally
receiving every channel at once while the set-top box serves only
as a filter to display one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional cable networks are built to transmit information
in only one direction: from the cable company toward the user, and
not the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   That poses a problem for telephones, which provide a two-way
service. Traditional telephone networks are in some way the obverse
of cable systems: They easily transmit communications in two
directions, but they do not have to carry much information at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the copper telephone wire as a very thin but very
intelligent pipe,'' said Sender Cohen, a data communications
analyst at Lehman Brothers, ``and the cable wire as very fat but
very dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   So AT&AMP;T's first challenge is to make all of the cable systems it
has agreed to acquire in some ways more like two-way telephone
systems. That project, which requires the deployment of new
equipment into cable hubs across the country, has already cost the
cable industry billions of dollars, and in Mediaone, AT&AMP;T is set to
acquire a cable operator with one of the most advanced networks in
the industry, but one that still requires significant upgrades.
AT&AMP;T has also struck partnerships with the Comcast Corp. and Time
Warner Inc., two big cable operators, to offer telephone service
using those companies' systems.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But even once a cable system has been adapted to send and
receive data, voice and television signals, it is still not ready
for the digital future. To offer high-speed Internet service, huge
investments must be made in high-speed Internet switches that can
route millions, even billions of bits of digital information every
second. Even more daunting is the prospect of offering telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Every house that intends to switch from conventional to
cable-based phone service must be visited by a trained technician
to install an electronic box outside the house to connect the
home's inside telephone wiring to the external cable wire. Big
telephone switches the size of a van must be purchased and
configured, almost by hand, to link with the cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are a myriad of seemingly mundane concerns that could
be vital to consumers. For instance, allowing people to keep the
same phone number when they switch to cable-based phone service is
quite complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is that traditional cable systems generally
use public power. When there is an electrical blackout, the cable
television also fails, but the phone almost always works. That is
because telephone wires carry power as well as communications,
allowing most phones to work without being plugged in. To match the
reliability of standard phone service using cable systems requires
big investments of money and ingenuity in complicated power
generation systems.
</P>
<P>
   All of these technical challenges are just to offer phone
service using conventional telephone technology, known as circuit
switching, albeit over cable wires. To offer phone service over
cable lines using Internet technology is even more complicated. In
fact, the technology to do so reliably does not even exist yet.
Armstrong said that he does not anticipate using Internet phone
systems until 2001.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The upshot for AT&AMP;T is that all of the billions of dollars and
millions of hours it will spend on the obvious technical challenges
may pale beside the time, effort and money it will spend revamping
its organization and deploying the anonymous ``back office''
computer systems that are the backbone of any modern business.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trucks may have to be purchased, thousands of
technicians hired and trained. Customer service representatives who
now work for cable companies will have to be trained to answer
questions about telephone and Internet service. One challenge in
finding qualified dispatchers, supervisors and other sorts of
support personnel is that almost no company in the world has tried
to sell integrated bundles of telephone, television and Internet
services to residential consumers who might not know a modem from a
remote control. (RCN Corp. is one company that has tried.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, internal billing and customer information systems for
AT&AMP;T will have to be added and revamped to support a broad range of
services for millions of customers who expect to be billed promptly
and accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies will win or lose on the billing battlefield,''
said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a
technology consulting firm in Boston. ``If your bill is wrong or it
doesn't go through, you're going to have a fit. Billing is the
Achilles heel of this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to AT&AMP;T's main business of selling long-distance
service, a relatively simple product, he added: ``It's one thing to
send you a bill for long-distance minutes. It's just the time of
day, the price and whatever stupid plan you bought. But when you
start talking about different television packages and different
speeds of data, you're talking about many more variables. And soon
those bills will have to be delivered electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is well aware of the incredible complexity of its
ambitions. It has enlisted Lockheed Martin, the big military
contractor with experience in managing complex projects, to help
keep track of all of the undertaking's moving parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue where management attention has to be applied
is to integrate all these things and cause them to come together in
a way that's coherent,'' said John C. Petrillo, AT&AMP;T's executive
vice president for strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are especially high for AT&AMP;T because its reputation
with consumers will be on the line. When a telephone cuts off for
no apparent reason, when an Internet connection drops in the middle
of a big download, when the television shuts off during the big
game, customers rarely forget.

TEAMS STILL LOOKING FOR MISSING, BUT NUMBER IS LOWER THAN EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Using listening devices and specially trained
dogs, rescue workers returned to obliterated neighborhoods on
Thursday with hopes of finding people who have been missing since
tornadoes struck Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Search teams were dispatched to five areas where there is the
``possibility'' that people remain trapped, said the Oklahoma State
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Crews were using dogs and sophisticated listening and lighting
devices to search crevices of wrecked buildings, shattered cars and
piles of trash for anyone, alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, however, refused to speculate on their chances of
finding anyone alive in the swath of death and destruction that
stretched through Oklahoma City and 11 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are bodies out there; we just don't know
how many,'' said Oklahoma Police Sgt. Jerry Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The death count from Monday night's tornadoes rose to 41
Thursday, when three more people died in area hospitals, according
to the medical examiner's office. All 41 have been positively
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office, which is helping coordinate
search efforts, said 14 people remained missing last night, down
significantly from the 54 on a list issued earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The number of missing dropped, officials said, as names were
matched with victims who had gone to hospitals or emergency
shelters, or had sought refuge with friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remained unaccounted for ``all could have been in
harm's way'' when a vicious storm system spawned an estimated 76
tornadoes in a five-state area, state Medical Examiner Fred Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be searching in all of the areas where we
believe there are legitimately missing people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was ``no evidence ... of living people,'' Jordan
stressed that the missing persons' list ``does not mean in any way
that these people are assumed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feared more bodies would be found, Jordan said:
``We might find a few more, but hopefully it will be far fewer''
than the number of missing.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews were concentrating on specific areas after finding
evidence of more people under debris, said Ray Blakeney, director
of operations for the medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some areas where there is a possibility that we may
have some remaining individuals,'' Blakeney said. ``We have
isolated these areas and we have five teams out at the present time
in these areas trying to locate anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the search teams were concentrating in the southern
portion of Oklahoma City and in the outlying areas of Bridge Creek,
Moore, Del City and Midwest City.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, emergency crews worked to clear debris and fallen
power lines, and families continued to pick through whatever is
left of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2,250 people have sought help at emergency Red
Cross shelters in the area, said Ben Frizzell, spokesman for the
Oklahoma Department of Civil Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to clean up and replace the damage will be astounding,
with estimates ``already up to about three-quarters of a billion
dollars,'' said one state insurance official who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't get really close to $1 billion,'' he said,
referring to the total property loss, ``I'll be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   State Farm said it expects its policyholders to make about
30,000 claims for a total of $183 million. No estimates were
available from other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Gov. Frank Keating met with other state lawmakers
and area mayors to discuss the needs of communities hardest hit,
and what can be done quickly for people who lost everything,
including identification papers.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Buchanan, a spokesman for Keating, said some victims are
having trouble applying for assistance from the Red Cross and the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) because they do not have
even a driver's license or birth certificate to prove their
identity.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, where an elementary school and high school were
destroyed, the 2,200 students will return to classes Monday,
finishing the final two weeks at a nearby college, another
elementary school and an old administration building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel strongly that in a time of crisis, one thing the
school can offer is routine, stability and structure in the school
day,'' said district spokeswoman Susan Pierce.. ``It's important
for those students who have suffered a great loss.''

FCC REVIEWERS URGE LIMITS ON SBC AND AMERITECH MERGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill.)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed $62 billion combination of SBC Communications Inc.
and Ameritech Corp., two of the nation's largest regional telephone
companies, ``flunks the public interest test'' and should be
blocked unless conditions to encourage competition are imposed,
according to staff investigators for the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Krattenmaker, who has overseen the agency's review,
summarized the staff's concerns Thursday at the opening of a public
hearing on the deal in Washington. Krattenmaker stopped short of
endorsing any of the deal-killing restrictions that have been
suggested by opponents of the merger, such as requiring that the
two companies first demonstrate that they have met the goals of
1996 legislation aimed at stimulating local phone competition. Nor
were any of the five commissioners who must eventually vote on the
deal present.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were concerned that the vehemence of the
staff's opposition might indicate that the companies would have to
make significant concessions to win approval. Shares in SBC, which
is based in San Antonio and is the acquiring company in the deal,
fell $1.1875, to $53.50, on the Big Board. Ameritech, which is
based in Chicago, dropped $1.25, to $66.0625.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the public is seeing now is that these are hard-nosed
negotiations,'' said Scott Cleland, an analyst for the Legg Mason
Precursor Group. ``But it has been _ and still is _ unlikely that
there are three votes on the commission to block this merger.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC and Ameritech played down the significance of Krattenmaker's
remarks and the hearing, in which both supporters and opponents
testified. ``We didn't hear anything we hadn't heard before,''
David Schlosser, a spokesman on regulatory affairs for SBC in
Washington, said. ``It's a chance to see it all in living color.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlosser said SBC and Ameritech had met with the FCC more than
60 times since the proposed deal was announced a year ago. In
recent weeks, Schlosser said, the agency's staff has been meeting
with representatives of the two phone companies on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with opponents on Thursdays and working on
its own on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that before approving the merger, the agency
must find that the combination would serve the public interest. The
two phone companies have argued that they meet that standard
without any conditions but have also opened the door to accepting
``narrowly tailored'' concessions. They have already divested
themselves of overlapping cellular phone operations to satisfy the
Justice Department concerns over possible antitrust violations. The
deal has been approved by Ohio regulators, and reviews are under
way in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has no time limit on its review, but William E. Kennard,
its chairman, said in a letter to the companies that he wanted an
agreement on conditions that would allow the deal to be approved by
the middle of June.
</P>
<P>
   Together, SBC and Ameritech would dominate phone service in a
swath of 11 Midwestern states from Texas to the Canadian border as
well as California and Nevada.  &QL;

TEAMS STILL LOOKING FOR MISSING, BUT NUMBER IS LOWER THAN EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Using listening devices and specially trained
dogs, rescue workers returned to obliterated neighborhoods on
Thursday with hopes of finding people who have been missing since
tornadoes struck Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Search teams were dispatched to five areas where there is the
``possibility'' that people remain trapped, said the Oklahoma State
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Crews were using dogs and sophisticated listening and lighting
devices to search crevices of wrecked buildings, shattered cars and
piles of trash for anyone, alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, however, refused to speculate on their chances of
finding anyone alive in the swath of death and destruction that
stretched through Oklahoma City and 11 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are bodies out there; we just don't know
how many,'' said Oklahoma Police Sgt. Jerry Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The death count from Monday night's tornadoes rose to 41
Thursday, when three more people died in area hospitals, according
to the medical examiner's office. All 41 have been positively
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office, which is helping coordinate
search efforts, said 14 people remained missing last night, down
significantly from the 54 on a list issued earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The number of missing dropped, officials said, as names were
matched with victims who had gone to hospitals or emergency
shelters, or had sought refuge with friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remained unaccounted for ``all could have been in
harm's way'' when a vicious storm system spawned an estimated 76
tornadoes in a five-state area, state Medical Examiner Fred Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be searching in all of the areas where we
believe there are legitimately missing people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was ``no evidence ... of living people,'' Jordan
stressed that the missing persons' list ``does not mean in any way
that these people are assumed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feared more bodies would be found, Jordan said:
``We might find a few more, but hopefully it will be far fewer''
than the number of missing.
</P>
<P>

NATO'S ACCORD WITH RUSSIA LEAVES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, anxious to find a
political solution to the Kosovo war as soon as possible, managed
to get the Russians on their side on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Washington and the allies, calculating that
isolating Slobodan Milosevic was critical to setting the stage for
negotiations, finessed several of their key demands and made it
clear that there was room for maneuver on the composition of an
international security force.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russians on board, administration officials acknowledge
there will be some hard choices to face as they try to fashion
negotiating principles that do not stray too far from demands that
NATO previously insisted were nonnegotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement in Germany was intended by the Western
allies to set the stage for what is known as a U.N. Chapter 7
resolution, which authorizes military operations in a country
without its consent.
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the resolution, a process now being hotly debated at
the White House, the administration will probably supply many of
the answers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key questions is the composition of the security
force that is planned to return the refugees to the province _ how
much will be a NATO operation, and how much a U.N. operation.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting in Germany, the word NATO was purposely
dropped as the price for winning Russian agreement. Milosevic, too,
has opposed involvement by the alliance in any type of force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of paper from the summit in Bonn, though, did not mean
that either the allies or the Russians had changed their minds on
this issue, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be fooling ourselves if we thought the Russians
wanted NATO at the core of the force,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   So now the question became whether the Russians gave in first on
the pre-eminence of NATO in the force or whether the allies did,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The missing element in Thursday's meeting was Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It was not expected that he would be heard from as the allies
cobbled together their diplomatic phalanx. But the Russian envoy,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, is expected to go to Belgrade in the coming
days. The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, plans to
meet with Chernomyrdin in Moscow on Sunday, presumably before the
Russian envoy departs for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   After Chernomyrdin's Belgrade trip, it will become clearer
whether Milosevic is under enough pressure from the airstrikes to
give a little. Or whether as some in the administration fear,
Milosevic will sit back, watch and wait for concessions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Milosevic has barely squinted at the allies' demands. At
the start of the airstrikes, he said he would consider an unarmed
U.N. mission in Kosovo. Last week, in an interview with a Western
journalist, he asserted he would allow a peacekeeping force with
weapons of self defense. But he specifically ruled out foreign
soldiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, as anxious to play a world role in the Kosovo
solution as the White House is anxious to get out of Kosovo, have
assumed a heavy mantle.
</P>
<P>
   In moments of candor, the Russians acknowledge they do not have
great leverage over the Yugoslav leader who has become more of a
burden to them as a traditional ally than an asset. And it appears
that the Russians have not been consulting with Milosevic this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only so much, some argue, that the Russians can do.
``The Russians can't deliver Milosevic unless Milosevic wants to be
delivered,'' said a State Department official, expressing some of
the doubts in the higher levels of the department that the Russian
strategy is going to work as well as the White House would like.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been trying to find a way out of Kosovo
fairly urgently, driven partly by the unpopularity of the NATO
strikes in Congress and the dip in President Clinton's public
opinion polls among the reasons. To accomplish a swift resolution,
the White House has to find some fairly creative solutions on the
composition of the peacekeeping force, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is discussion within the administration about
whether the force should be formed around the guidelines of the
U.N. force in Bosnia during the war there. Known as UNPROFOR, these
troops were authorized to fire only in self defense and did not
include Americans. This option has been ruled out, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, becoming known as ``glorified UNPROFOR,'' would
put a U.N. label on a force with much stronger rules of engagement
than in Bosnia and would include American and other NATO forces.
Such a force, under a U.N. command, is being likened to the
multinational force that was deployed in Somalia in the early 1990s
and left after the deaths of 17 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   This option is unlikely to win favor because the administration
has insisted that NATO have command and control of any American
peacekeeping troops dispatched to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The third option, which has been the preferred administration
notion so far, would have troops from the main NATO countries in
the force, including the United States, as well as non-NATO
countries such as Russia and Ukraine. In such a configuration, the
NATO forces would be under NATO command and control and the
non-NATO forces would have a separate command.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario of this third version, according to a Russian
Foreign Ministry official, would place some of the Russian troops
in a northern part of Kosovo where there is a concentration of Serb
religious monuments and significant numbers of Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the allied troops would be in the remainder of
Kosovo as a way of enticing the ethnic Albanian refugees back to
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have made clear that after the terror and mass
expulsions by the Serbs they will not return to Kosovo with
Russians, perceived as Serb allies, as their protectors.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement on Thursday, the foreign ministers of the
Group of Seven richest nations and Russia left open another
contentious question: how many of the Serb forces now in Kosovo
would have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, the Russians side with the Serbs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the allies have always agreed that Kosovo should remain
part of Yugoslavia _ under an expanded autonomy arrangement _ the
Russians argue that the Serbs should be allowed to keep some forces
in Kosovo as part of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In their past declarations, the allies had not stated that the
Serbs had to withdraw `all' forces, although the United States and
Britain have maintained that is what they meant.
</P>
<P>
   If Serb forces, no matter how minimal, were permitted to stay in
Kosovo, the chances of a refugee return _ the very raison d'etre of
the bombing _ would be extremely limited.

VOTERS IN SCOTLAND, WALES GO TO POLLS TO DECIDE LEGISLATURES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ Britons voted Thursday in elections that
will give Scotland its first legislature in nearly 300 years and
Wales its first ever.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for more than 12,000 members of local councils
throughout Britain, the 129 members of the Scottish Parliament and
the 60 members of the National Assembly of Wales also constituted
the first national report card on the performance of Prime Minister
Tony Blair since his election two years ago, and the voting offered
an opportunity for the opposition Conservatives to start rebuilding
after their overwhelming 1997 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the polls closed at 10 p.m. Thursday, the BBC
forecast Labor winning the most seats in the Scottish Parliament
but not enough to exercise total control. If the votes bear out
that prediction, Labor would be expected to make a cooperative
arrangement with the centrist Liberal Democrats, thereby
introducing coalition politics into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The Scots and the Welsh were exposed for the first time to
Continental-style proportional representation voting. They cast two
parliamentary ballots, one from a list of district candidates and a
second from a list of parties. To choose local councilors, they
filled out a third ballot. Final results will be known on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two regional legislatures, along with the new one
established in Belfast for Northern Ireland, form the centerpiece
of Blair's program of ``devolution,'' the decentralizing of power
and parceling out to the regions of Britain authority long held in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Control of foreign, defense, economic and fiscal policy remains
with the British Parliament, but the new bodies will have sway over
matters like transportation, health, education and housing in their
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's election amounted to a fundamental remapping of the
British political landscape. The vote here has attracted interest
from other European countries with autonomous regions, and in the
international press corps assembled in Edinburgh to cover the
elections there were a striking number of correspondents from
restive places like the Basque and Catalan provinces of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The new Scottish legislature has greater power than its Welsh
counterpart, and the race here between Labor and the upstart
Scottish Nationalists has drawn the most attention of any of the
contests across Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, celebrating his 46th birthday Thursday, called on Scots
to give a thumbs-down to the Nationalists' hopes for full
independence for Scotland, and voters at one Edinburgh polling
station seemed to be heeding his call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're independent enough as we are,'' said Robert
Docherty, a student. ``I have no worries about my Scottishness.''

the odds of something so vile emerging again in a matter of days or
weeks would be astronomical. And yet February sweeps managed to

   FILM-ELECTION (Undated) _ As directed by Alexander Payne,
``Election,'' which opens this weekend, is mostly funny. Matthew
Broderick as teacher Jim McAlister, gives a wonderfully deadpan and
long-suffering performance, much of it is very cleverly written and
staged, and its off-beat structure (with narration from all four
principal characters) somehow gives a brilliant cross-section of
the particular horror that is high-school life.

Rattigan's play quite closely, it somehow fails to be a compelling

STOCKS SLIDE AFTER GREENSPAN SPARKS RATE-HIKE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell Thursday, after Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan cast an early pall over trading with comments that
revived fears of tighter credit.
</P>
<P>
   The stock and bond markets remained under pressure through most
of the day. It was the fifth consecutive session that stock prices
switched direction from the day before. At the close, the
technology-heavy Nasdaq market had skidded 2.45 percent, or 62.17
points, to 2,472.28, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks
was down by 1.13 percent, or 15.26 points, to 1,332.05.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrials staged a late-session
comeback that briefly lifted the average into positive territory
but, unlike Wednesday, it retreated again to close with a small
loss, 8.59 points, to 10,946.82.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to citing exceptionally strong growth of the economy
and ``imbalances'' that could lead to revived inflation, Greenspan
referred directly to the stock market. The long expansion, he said,
``has induced a spectacular rise in equity prices that to many has
reached well beyond the justifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates rising as much as 1/10 of a percentage point
along a broad front, stock-market traders once again bailed out of
Internet and other computer-related stocks and redeployed some of
this money into less expensive issues, including some of the
cyclicals such as papers.
</P>
<P>
   But other groups, including retailing and oil, slumped as well,
and analysts struggled for explanations of the recent churning and
rapid-fire rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of conviction'' in the market, said Alan
Bond, president of Albriond Capital Management. ``People have
clearly used advances to take some profits.''
</P>
<P>
   To Robert Froehlich, vice chairman of Scudder Kemper
Investments, the cashing in of profits lately has been mostly an
effort to rebalance portfolios swollen with gains in
high-technology and does not reflect a decision that cyclicals
should be bought because of improved prospects for economic
recovery abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you lighten up is where you made all your money,''
Froehlich said, contending that moving some of it into economically
sensitive stocks was simply a search for better value. ``I think
people are misreading the rally in cyclicals,'' he said, and
loading up on them is probably a mistake since the higher commodity
prices needed to sustain further big gains are unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T made the biggest impact on the Dow, surging another 5
points, to 61 15/16 following Wednesday's 5]-point advance.
Microsoft is to invest $5 billion in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Next were Alcoa, a hard-core cyclical, rising 3 9/16, to 63},
and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, a drug and medical supplies company that is
almost impervious to economic conditions, up 3|, to 97|.
</P>
<P>
   But just as many Dow stocks fell as rose. The biggest losers
were J.P. Morgan, down 3 11/16, to 135 5/16, Hewlett-Packard off 2
15/16, to 77 5/16, and Citigroup off 2 15/16, to 69 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers slumped despite stronger-than-expected April sales,
with Wal-Mart down 2 3/16, to 42~, TJX down 2 1/16, to 30{, and
Costco down 2 11/16, to 79 3/16. Mobil, falling 3 11/16, to 102},
led the oil stocks lower, with Exxon and Chevron each losing more
than 2 points. Royal Dutch, however, gained 1 11/16, to 60 15/16,
after reporting a profit decline that was less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The battering of technology stocks took America Online down 10,
to 119}, Microsoft 1 3/16, to 77 15/16, Amazon.com 9[, to 137],
Priceline.com 11}, to 139 7/16, Ebay 11 5/16, to 175{, and Intel 4
5/16, to 59 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the Internet-oriented brokerage house, lost 4[,
to 103], after trading as high as 155 in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume eased a bit further to
879.11 million shares as advancing issues barely edged declining
ones, 1,503 to 1,490. Nasdaq volume was 909.6 million.

MARKET PLACE: GREENSPAN DOUBTS THE FINAL DEFEAT OF INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Previously skedded as GREENSPAN) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a remarkable run of prosperity that he
credited in large part to new technology, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan delivered his bluntest warning in months Thursday
that the economy could still be derailed by its old nemesis,
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a sweeping analysis of the forces reshaping the
economy at home and abroad, Greenspan said the ability of
businesses to use rapid advances in computers and communications to
hold down costs and produce higher-quality goods and services had
helped hold down price increases, bolster the stock market and
allow the economy to grow robustly.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it would be risky to assume that technology could
continue to keep the economy and Wall Street surging forever or
that the business cycle and all the old economic rules had been
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in
our economy that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of
strong growth and low inflation to a close,'' Greenspan said in
remarks to bankers in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his list was declining unemployment, which he said
would eventually push wages and perhaps prices higher in an
inflationary spiral. He added the possibility of a stock market
downturn, which he said would cause consumers and businesses to cut
their spending. And he said the rapidly growing trade deficit could
one day become unsustainable, though it has caused no trouble so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's inflation warning and his observation that many
people think stocks have risen to levels ``well beyond the
justifiable'' rattled Wall Street, sending bond prices sharply
lower and equities down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   While it gave no indication that the Fed has any plans to raise
interest rates, Greenspan's speech seemed intended as a cautionary
flag to those investors and economists who have concluded that the
United States has built a ``new economy'' in which inflation has
been vanquished, corporate earnings will rise forever and the
central bank remains on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has helped drive the talk of a new economy by holding
back pressure from traditionalists inside and outside the Fed for
interest rate increases as steady growth has pushed unemployment
down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent without generating inflation.
But Greenspan is very sensitive to any impression that he has gone
soft on price stability, and Thursday he planted one foot firmly in
the inflation-hawk camp without quite removing the other from the
new age camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not say we are in a new era, because I have experienced
too many alleged new eras in my lifetime that have come and gone,''
said Greenspan, who is 73 and has been running the Fed for almost
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are far more likely, instead, to be experiencing a
structural shift similar to those that have visited our economy
from time to time in the past,'' he said. ``These shifts can have
profound effects, often overriding conventional economic patterns
for a number of years, before those patterns begin to show through
again over the longer term.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said they still expected the Fed to hold rates steady
at its next meeting May 18. But they said Greenspan clearly wanted
to guard against complacency within the Fed and in the financial
markets, especially if the unemployment rate falls again when the
Labor Department releases April's jobs data Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have felt he needed a way to get our feet back on the
ground without going overboard in that direction,'' said L. Douglas
Lee, an economist at HSBC Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Greenspan was careful to point out the economy's strong
points in addition to the potential pitfalls. He noted that the
worst of the global financial crisis seemed to have passed. And he
devoted much of his speech to the case that technology has greatly
improved the growth rate of productivity, or output per worker, the
measure considered the most important in determining the economy's
long-run potential.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity growth, which has been sluggish for nearly three
decades and which slipped below 1 percent in the early 1990s,
averaged 3 percent over the most recent four quarters, Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman said the reason appeared to be the heavy
investment in technology made by American business over the last
five years. Computers, data bases, and faster and more reliable
communication have all enabled companies to operate more
efficiently by reducing their need for extra inventories of parts
and extra workers, he said, since they have a much better handle on
what is happening almost minute by minute in their markets and
within their operations.
</P>
<P>
   The consistent increases in analysts' projections for long-term
corporate earnings growth, Greenspan said, suggests that companies
are telling Wall Street that they expect productivity increases
driven by technology to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in business investment in technology, Greenspan said,
has not only restrained costs but also helped to expand industrial
capacity faster than industrial output. The resulting excess in
capacity has in turn helped keep prices down, helping offset any
pressure from tight labor.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Greenspan said, has been a ``truly phenomenal''
economic performance in recent years. But he said it was unclear
how long it could continue.
</P>
<P>
   If productivity growth ``should level out or actually falter
because additional technology synergies fail to materialize, or
because output per hour has been less tied to technology in the
first place, inflationary pressures could re-emerge, possibly
faster than some currently perceive feasible,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a slowdown in productivity, the biggest potential threat
to the continuation of expansion, now in its ninth year, is from a
tight labor market, the Fed chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, labor market conditions can become so tight
that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing
the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will then
eventually begin to accelerate,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Should the stock market tumble, Greenspan said, ``consumer and
business investment demands would doubtless weaken considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   A more distant concern, Greenspan said, is the mounting trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence at this point that markets are
disinclined to readily finance our foreign net imbalance,''
Greenspan said. ``But the arithmetic of foreign debt accumulation
and compounding interest costs does indicate somewhere in the
future that, unless reversed, our growing international imbalances
are apt to create significant problems for our economy.'' &QL;

   NORMAN, Okla. _ Keith Prather showed up on Thursday at York
International's massive air-conditioning-unit plant on Interstate
35.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than taking his place on the assembly line, he picked
up empty boxes, snacks and water from a donation pantry recently
set up in the company's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that ripped through his southeast Oklahoma City
neighborhood left Prather, 28, his wife and two children homeless,
but York helped book the family into a nearby hotel, gave them $200
for necessities and is paying him despite his having not worked all
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is doing wonderful things,'' said Prather, who took his
family to a shelter in a mall to ride out the storm. ``They got in
touch with my mother-in-law and said they had hotels and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, companies large and
small are supporting workers who lost much, if not everything, to
the storm. Even as businesses themselves lose untold amounts due to
absenteeism, loss of power, transportation and merchandise, they
are donating food, clothing, supplies, cars, shelter and phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and state commerce officials have yet to put a price
tag on losses in productivity, spending and personal assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are simply not there,'' said Ann Dee Lee, a
spokeswoman with the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, which tracks
manufacturers and service businesses, but not the retail industry.
``We don't know who's been hit and who hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after Monday's tornadoes, up to 400 of York's 1,200
employees missed work because they lost their homes, transportation
or access to day care, or they couldn't get through closed roads or
were helping others, said Becky Payton, York's human resources
manager. No employees were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The company had to shut down shifts and had trouble getting
parts in and out the door, but it still gave affected employees a
minimum of $200, rental cars, temporary shelter and access to
donations collected from employees, customers and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wal-Mart on Southwest 19th Street in Moore, where 675
people work full- and part-time, about 100 people have missed work
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Forty employees at that store and a Wal-Mart in south Oklahoma
City have lost their homes and possessions, said district manager
Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The store lost power overnight Monday and began giving away
supplies to emergency relief agencies while ``tens of thousands''
of dollars worth of refrigerated and frozen food was lost, Moore
said. With a disaster backup plan in place, the store had shipments
of replacement food the next day.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wal-Mart has given $15,000 in cash and $25,000 in
merchandise to affected employees and nearly $40,000 to area Red
Cross agencies, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't replace everything that was lost, but we are doing
what we can,'' Moore said. ``If it means the store is going to pay
for them to stay in a motel for a week or two, that's what we're
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others employers feel the same way. VIP Communications, a
wireless phone and pager merchant in Moore, set up a free wireless
phone for victims to use.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Herriott, owner of Tightwads Variety Stores on North Janeway
Street in Moore, has fed 2,200 people barbecue ribs, brisket and
hot dogs the past two days in front of his business, which has been
closed without power since Monday. A nearby neighborhood filled
with his usual customers was flattened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchandise-wise, we lost a few thousand dollars at least, and
we're lucky,'' he said, pointing to the nearby destruction. ``We
cater to the neighborhood, and there ain't nothing left.''

6-YEAR-OLD BOY HAS NOT YET GRASPED THE LOSS OF HIS MOTHER

<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ Days after rescuers found him searching
for his mother amid the rubble left by a killer tornado, Jordan
Wiese, 6, passes the time playing Nintendo at his grandmother's
house in the rural community of Bridge Creek.
</P>
<P>
   His family learned Thursday that Jordan's mother, Kara Wiese,
won't be coming home. They tried to break the news to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only response at that time was `How come?''' said Darlene
Quiroz, Wiese's aunt and Jordan's godmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to give him time to digest it,'' she said. ``He's been
so busy, he hasn't had time to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's family has waited since Monday, when the tornado's
winds ripped Wiese from her son's tight embrace, for word of her
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to them, Wiese had already been found.
</P>
<P>
   Since about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, fewer than 12 hours after the
tornado struck, the body of a woman lay in a school turned
temporary morgue. The body was transferred to the Oklahoma medical
examiner's officer.
</P>
<P>
   There, authorities recognized it as similar in description to
Wiese.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, family members were asked to bring in Wiese's
fingerprints, taken while she was still in school, for comparison.
When the phone rang about 9 a.m. Thursday, any hopes the family had
were erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning they called and said it's definite,'' Quiroz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alone Monday night in the devastated Southern Hills area of
Bridge Creek, the bruised and battered kindergartner had wandered
around searching for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so worried about his mom,'' Quiroz said. ``He wanted to
get to someone he knew so they could help find his mom.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor found the boy, who was taken to Southwest Medical
Center, then released the next day to his grandmother, Mary Wiese.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the families of the 40 other people whose bodies
have been recovered, the shock of what happened is still sinking in
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Redwine can still vividly remember the ``girl chat'' she
had with her 46-year-old sister, Bonnie Price, days before Price's
only son, Jeffrey Don Price, got married last month. They discussed
what they were wearing, made jokes and laughed heartily.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the family was burying Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll cherish the memory of that conversation always,'' Redwine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Redwine did not learn until hours after the tornado that her
sister, a nurse who worked various shifts at three retirement
centers in Kingfisher, had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Price was at her late father's home in Dover when her
niece called and urged her to take shelter in the storm cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said `Bonnie, the storm's heading right for you,'''
Redwine said.
</P>
<P>
   Price declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said `No, I'm not scared of the storm. If it comes, Ill
just get in the bathtub,'' Redwine said.
</P>
<P>
   Price was found in the rubble of the home about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not make it to the bathtub,'' Redwine said.
</P>
<P>
   Redwine said she believes that Price had no idea what hit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like she just went to sleep,'' Redwine said.
``Seeing the peace on her face helped.''

<P>
   So far, Wal-Mart has given $15,000 in cash and $25,000 in
merchandise to affected employees and nearly $40,000 to area Red
Cross agencies, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't replace everything that was lost, but we are doing
what we can,'' Moore said. ``If it means the store is going to pay
for them to stay in a motel for a week or two, that's what we're
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others employers feel the same way. VIP Communications, a
wireless phone and pager merchant in Moore, set up a free wireless
phone for victims to use.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Herriott, owner of Tightwads Variety Stores on North Janeway
Street in Moore, has fed 2,200 people barbecue ribs, brisket and
hot dogs the past two days in front of his business, which has been
closed without power since Monday. A nearby neighborhood filled
with his usual customers was flattened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchandise-wise, we lost a few thousand dollars at least, and
we're lucky,'' he said, pointing to the nearby destruction. ``We
cater to the neighborhood, and there ain't nothing left.''

COMPANY AGREES TO ALTER USE OF DATA GLEANED FROM CHILDREN ON WEB 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its second Internet-privacy enforcement action,
the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that a
multibillion-dollar investment company had agreed to change the way
its World Wide Web site treats information it gathers from children
and teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency announced a settlement with Liberty Financial Cos. of
Boston, whose Young Investor Web site has advertised itself as ``a
place to learn about money and maybe even earn some too.'' The FTC
said Liberty Financial had not kept its promise that all data
collected from users would be kept ``totally anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose survey asked Web site users about their
weekly allowances, whether their parents were saving for their
college education and other financial matters, actually used the
information to identify specific individuals, the government
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The company also failed to keep promises to send e-mail
newsletters and to award prizes in contests designed to appeal to
children, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the FTC chairman, said Liberty Financial had
agreed to post a more detailed privacy notice on its Web site and
to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal
identifying information from children.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Thayer, a spokesman for the company, which manages assets
worth $61 billion, said Thursday that Liberty Financial had kept
the information it gleaned from children ``confidential,'' if not
strictly anonymous, and had never misused it. ``Liberty Financial
supports completely the FTC policy to protect the privacy of
children,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, in the government's first Internet-privacy
enforcement, the FTC reached a settlement with Geocities, a
California-based organization that offers members their own Web
pages, e-mail addresses and information of topics of interest to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Geocities had lied when it told more than 2 million
subscribers, both adults and children, that it would not disclose
personal information it collected. In fact, the FTC said, the
information was used by advertisers. Geocities did not admit
wrongdoing.

   MUSIC-DIDDLEY (Seattle) _ Despite the fans he has made and the
awards he has won as one of the pioneers of rock 'n' roll, Bo
Diddley feels like a two-time loser. In the 1950s, '60s and '70s,
it was unscrupulous lawyers, agents and label executives that
conned him out of money he was rightly owed from the sales of his
records. Today, it's bootleggers, pirates and the Internet that are
depriving him of a better living.

STOCK OPTIONS ROIL BLACK EMPOWERMENT COMPANY IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Two board members of South Africa's
most prominent black empowerment company have announced their
resignations in the face of increasing outrage over a plan to award
themselves and two other board members stock options worth more
than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company, New Africa Investments Ltd., said that its founding
directors, Dr. Nthato Motlana and Jonty Sandler, would resign as of
Tuesday, May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Motlana, 74, who was President Nelson Mandela's personal
physician and a founder of Soweto health clinics, had been the
leading beneficiary of efforts by white South African businesses to
empower blacks by breaking off large chunks of their operations and
selling them to black executives at below-market prices.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, black empowerment has been possibly the
most important trend in South African business. At one point, by
some calculations, blacks had gained ownership or significant
control of companies representing 10 percent of the market
capitalization on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But such deals have been criticized as creating a handful of
black millionaires without improving the lives of ordinary black
people or changing the white domination of South African business.
The shake-up at New Africa Investments, the country's best-known
empowerment vehicle, is likely to again raise questions about the
broader achievement of empowerment deals.
</P>
<P>
   New Africa Investments, the corporate face of a group of holding
companies controlled by family trusts representing Motlana, Sandler
and two other board members, was founded in 1993 and performed well
in the mid-'90s, building a huge media and financial services
conglomerate. But over the last year, the price of its shares owned
by the public have sunk to a 40 percent discount to their net asset
value.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the four board members had planned to award
themselves $20 million worth of stock options, an arrangement
largely attributed to Sandler, the only white member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board withdrew the proposal the day before the company's
annual meeting last month, when shareholders discovered the plan
and vehemently objected.
</P>
<P>
   The company went ahead with the meeting, but Motlana apparently
refused to answer questions on a variety of subjects including the
option proposal and other aspects of the board members'
compensation. When a shareholder noted that an annual report had
said New Africa Investments was committed to openness and
integrity, Motlana closed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, several big stockholders threatened to sell their
shares and objected to the way the meeting had been handled.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations, which were announced late Wednesday, were
welcomed Thursday by the stock market, with New Africa Investments
shares rising by nearly 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing the resignations of Motlana and
Sandler, the company said that the two remaining board members,
Dikgang Moseneke and Zwelakhe Sisulu, had volunteered to open their
pay packages for renegotiation, an extraordinary development in the
South African corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   Motlana's departure from New Africa Investments was the second
big blow to black empowerment. It followed the forced resignation
last year of Mzilikazi Khumalo as chairman of JCI Mining Co.,
barely a year after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Under Khumalo's leadership, the company was virtually destroyed.
Khumalo's fortunes were hurt by a sinking gold price, but he drove
off other executives and secretly committed the company to buy $50
million worth of shares in a mining-exploration company he partly
owned. That deal was canceled when the board discovered it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly two years after leveling a police brutality
charge that shocked New York City, Abner Louima took the witness
stand Thursday and told a rapt courtroom audience a horrific story
of being tortured by two officers in the restroom of a Brooklyn
police station.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during Louima's three-and-a-half hours of
testimony, some of it brutally graphic, the 32-year-old Haitian
immigrant stood up, scanned the room and pointed at one of his
accused attackers, Officer Justin Volpe. Volpe stared back,
expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in calm, steady tones, his voice breaking only once,
Louima testified in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that after
being arrested in a Flatbush street brawl in August 1997, he was
beaten in a police car by four officers, and that two of them later
took him into a restroom at the 70th Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   He said that there, while he was handcuffed and crying in pain
from a kick to the groin, one of the officers held him down while
the other thrust an object into his rectum and then his mouth,
telling him that he was tasting his own feces and warning him that
if he ever told anyone what had just happened, he would be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Volpe put an object in my rectum and pull it out and
he put it in my mouth,'' Louima said, speaking in heavily accented
English.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that the object was part of a broken broomstick.
They say that it tore his rectum and bladder, injuries that
hospitalized him for two months and required two operations.
</P>
<P>
   Louima did not identify the officer who held him down, but
prosecutors have charged that it was Officer Charles Schwarz. He
and the other two officers on trial, who are accused only of
beating Louima in the police car, are white, and their alleged
brutalization of Louima, who is black, has given the case racially
charged dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Schwarz, along with Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder, are on trial on federal charges of violating Louima's civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the blistering start of cross examinations that will continue
next week, Volpe's lawyer portrayed Louima not as the victim of
nightmarish police abuse, but as a money-motivated plaintiff who
was reciting a concocted, well-rehearsed story designed to win him
millions of dollars in a civil suit he has filed against the city
and police.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, contended that Louima was already
ahead of the game because he has been getting $2,000 a month from
the FBI for rent and other living expenses for himself and his
family, and additional money from supporters like the fight
promoter Don King. Those contributions, Kornberg said, has garnered
more income for Louima than his work as a private security guard
did before his encounter with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are making more money, getting more money per month from
the government, than you were making when you were working,''
Kornberg declared before Louima said he has been unable to work
since the alleged incident. In a series of questions about details
that Louima has given to investigators and to the news media about
his encounter with the police officers, Kornberg showed
inconsistencies intended to demonstrate that Louima's tale of abuse
is not credible.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that Louima originally had said that he
had been attacked with a plunger, but that now the prosecution says
the object was part of a broomstick. And when Kornberg resumes his
cross examination of Louima at the next trial session on Monday, he
is expected to stress two lies that Louima admitted to earlier
under questioning by a prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lies, Louima admitted under Vinegrad's friendly
questioning, was that he had originally told investigators and
reporters that one of the officers who attacked him had said ``This
is Giuliani time! It's not Dinkins time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that true?'' Vinegrad, an assistant U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn, asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' responded Louima, his slender, 5-foot-8-inch figure clad
in a long black jacket and folded into the witness chair next to
Judge Eugene Nickerson's bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear any police officer make that statement?''
Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, explaining that he had begun falsely reporting
it at the urging of a supporter _ a brother-in-law of a nurse at
the hospital _ who told him he was an auxiliary police officer and
frequently heard polilce officers make such statements.
</P>
<P>
   Louima said the man told him, ``I must say it to get the mayor's
attention and the attention of people responsible for justice.''
Four months later, Louima testified, he confessed the falsehood to
federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plunger detail, he said he had honestly thought the
object was a plunger because while he had not seen the object, he
had seen Volpe pick it up inside the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg on Thursday did not reach what is expected to be the
most sensational topic of his questioning, involving his suggestion
in the trial's opening arguments on Tuesday that Louima had
suffered his rectum and bladder injuries not at the hands of
police, but in an act of consensual sex with another man before he
encountered the officers.

 &HT;    Braves rotation's ready to roll
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Figure this one out. Four-time Cy Young Award winner
Greg Maddux owns a 4.34 ERA, two-time Cy Young winner Tom Glavine
has a 4.61 ERA, and new Braves No. 4 starter Kevin Millwood is at
4.70.
</P>
<P>
   And still the Atlanta starting rotation, which begins a
nine-game road trip tonight in San Diego, is at its usual perch
atop major league baseball's ERA list at 3.75.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically, the Braves owe John Smoltz and his 1.69 ERA. But
the numbers also say something else _ the other starters are
beginning to put things together.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 15 games, Atlanta's starting pitching staff
ranked eighth in the majors with a 4.27 ERA and a 5-5 record. In
the dozen games since, Atlanta starters have gone 8-2 with a 3.20
ERA. The last full time through the rotation, each of the five
starters recorded victories, the first time that had happened since
September 1997. In the process, rookie Odalis Perez got his first
major-league win and lowered his ERA to 3.70.
</P>
<P>
   With another strong performance from Smoltz on Wednesday,
Atlanta's pitchers moved past Houston (3.78).
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be pretty happy about what's gone on,'' Glavine
said, ``because, let's face it, I haven't thrown the ball very
well; Kevin's been off and on. You've got a young guy in Odalis
who's done pretty well. So, really, John and Greg were the only
guys in the rotation who were really throwing the ball well. We've
got a bullpen full of young guys trying to get experience, and yet
we've got a pretty darn good record (19-8).
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's the encouraging thing _ that as a staff we're
not where we want to be yet, but we're still winning a lot of ball
games. So how good are we going to be when we're all pitching
well?''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood has made the biggest turnaround on the staff, bouncing
back from three subpar starts to make two good ones. He will pitch
the series opener tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood thinks peer pressure is helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you want to be good,'' he said. ``It makes everybody
work a little harder, study film a little more, study hitters a
little more. There are three pitchers in this clubhouse who are
three of the best in baseball. I'm not going out trying to be
better than them. I'm trying to be as good as I can be, and if
that's not as good as them, then that's that. But you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   After the series in San Diego, the Braves play three at San
Francisco, Monday-Wednesday, before facing the Cubs in Chicago
starting next Friday.

 &HT;    Crawford draws tough assignment
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chris Crawford was a second-round draft pick, 51st out
of 58 players taken in the 1997 draft. He came to Atlanta hoping to
earn enough money to someday open a sports bar back home in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, years from now when Crawford retires, he will not
only have the money, he will be the guy the customers want to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the big guy down there? Curly hair, getting a little
paunchy? He once guarded Grant Hill in the NBA playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No kiddin'. How'd he do?''
</P>
<P>
   The response had better be ``held his own'' or ``pretty good,''
if the Hawks are going to knock out the Detroit Pistons in their
first-round series that starts Saturday night at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   An unimposing veteran of 82 games over two seasons, owner of an
undistinguished 6.9 average, Crawford would celebrate his 24th
birthday next week. But he won't have time. Grant Hill will see to
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens is aware of the task Crawford faces. ``The thing
is, he can't be intimidated,'' the coach said. ``Chris has played
well against Grant, so he can't allow the circumstance to overwhelm
him. And we have to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens wants Crawford to keep Hill busy, so that Hill can't
cheat over and help double-team guard Steve Smith or slap the ball
away in the post. ``We can't let him roam,'' Wilkens said. ``Chris
has got to go hard, get up the floor, make Grant work. He's got to
contribute offensively, and he's got to stay away from cheap
fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Wilkens doesn't want to commit Ty Corbin
to the small forward slot. He'd rather have Corbin ready to play
behind Crawford and shooting guard Steve Smith, but it can happen
only if Crawford makes a credible showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very positive about this,'' said Crawford. ``I know (Hill)
is a great player, but I can do some things.''

LAWYER WON'T FIGHT TO COLLECT DISPUTED $260 MILLION FROM TOBACCO
SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Miss., Texas) (rk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawyer who was awarded $260 million from Texas' settlement
with the tobacco industry backed down Thursday from efforts to
collect the money from the state.
</P>
<P>
   His retreat followed Wednesday's accusation by the Texas
attorney general that the fee had been ``procured by fraud'' with
the help of former Attorney General Dan Morales.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the case date from January 1998, when Texas became
the third state to settle litigation seeking to recover
smoking-related Medicaid costs from the tobacco industry. As a
result of the Texas settlement, for $17.3 billion, the lawyer, Marc
D. Murr of Houston, was awarded the $260 million by a state
arbitration panel last September.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawyers later maintained that Murr had done little or
no work on the case. And on Wednesday, Attorney General John
Cornyn, who took office this January, said in a court filing that
his predecessor, Morales, had fraudulently arranged to have it
appear that Murr had played a central role in representing the
state and for him to get 3 percent of the settlement. Cornyn's
filing alleged phony contracts between the state and Murr
characterized by backdating and false signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Morales and Murr worked together at a Houston law firm in the
early 1980s, and they have remained friends. The FBI has been
looking into the matter of Murr's fee, say people who have been
reached by investigators. Justice Department officials declined to
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said as early as last summer that Murr had played an
important role in the preparation of the state's lawsuit. And a
lawyer for Morales has called Cornyn's accusations false and
bizarre, and accused Cornyn, a Republican, of trying to damage the
political career of Morales, a Democrat who did not run for
re-election last fall but is seen as a prospective candidate for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In his filing, Cornyn said a contract, providing a 3 percent
fee, which Murr presented to the state arbitration panel last year,
was a fake. This was the panel that ultimately awarded Murr $260
million, half the 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, other lawyers in the case told a national
arbitration panel that they were not aware that Murr had even been
involved in the lawsuit. The national panel awarded Murr just $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   In their settlements with Texas, Mississippi and Florida _ the
first three states to reach accord with the tobacco industry _ the
cigarette makers agreed to pay those states' lawyers whatever
amounts were awarded by the national panel. Since that panel
awarded Murr only $1 million, the state of Texas faced having to
pay the remaining $259 million awarded by the state panel.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, at a hearing in the U.S. District Court in
Texarkana, Texas, Murr, required to show why the state panel's
award should not be thrown out, agreed not to pursue any money from
the state. That move left his compensation at $1 million from
tobacco companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue that would have been argued before the court Thursday
was whether the state arbitration panel _ whose members were chosen
by Morales, representing Texas, and Murr _ had been improperly
constituted. Once Murr abandoned his fight, Judge David Folsom gave
him 60 days to change his mind, although Murr would have to go
before a new arbitration panel to argue his case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said that he strongly doubted any such turnabout and that
his office's investigation of Murr would likely end unless Murr
again sought money from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming Murr doesn't press any more claims against the state,
then I think those matters will necessarily be the focus of only
the federal investigation,'' Cornyn said in an interview. ``I think
our job relative to Murr will have concluded.'' But he added, ``If
I had to guess, I would say it will come up in some courtroom
someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn declined to elaborate on that remark or to specify what
evidence of wrongdoing he had.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Texarkana Thursday, Murr's lawyer, Roy
Q. Minton of Austin, acknowledged that one contract between the
state and Murr had been assembled after the date inscribed on it,
The Associated Press reported. ``We frequently have contracts that
are dated from the day they are effective,'' Minton said.
</P>
<P>
   Minton did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the
reason for Murr's retreat.

 &HT;    The Heat is on!
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The team that might win the NBA title resides under the
perpetual sun of South Florida and in the shadow of vibrant Miami
Beach. But don't let that intoxicating atmosphere fool you about
the Heat. They wear hard hats, not Speedos.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Riley's club takes a physical, unrelenting, forceful
posture. It's almost as if the Heat's approach is to hound the ball
every inch of the floor for 48 minutes _ and occasionally score a
basket or two.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds ugly, yes. But it has been effective enough to place
Miami atop the Eastern Conference as the wide-open playoffs start
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits everywhere agree: There is no clear-cut favorite to win
this year's Michael Jordan-less championship. The only certainty is
that the Bulls, who won the last three, will pass the torch. They
failed to even qualify.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not the Heat?
</P>
<P>
   _ They have the best record in the Eastern Conference at 33-17,
giving them the home-court advantage for three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have the best coach in the league in Riley, who won four
championships with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have MVP candidate Alonzo Mourning, who has been more
controlled and mature this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have an outstanding defense, second statistically to
Atlanta, allowing 84.0 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have one of the league's best postseason performers in
Tim Hardaway, who is fearless and virtually unguardable without a
double-team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right there,'' Hardaway said. ``The playoffs are a
different story from the regular season; everybody knows that. But
we've put ourselves in a position now to handle our business to get
to the finals. It's about showing now that we're coming with it
every game. No excuses. We have a team that should win.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley is especially excited because he has a healthy team. Miami
started the season without two inured starters, guard Voshon
Leonard and small forward Jamal Mashburn. Mashburn came back a
month ago and has played mostly solid ball. Leonard has been back
from leg troubles for a few weeks. Mourning overcame a bad eye to
return recently, so Riley has the full complement of players
heading into the battle royale against the eighth-seeded New York
Knicks on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of this team is that we can beat anyone,''
Mourning said. ``I don't know if anyone's afraid of us, but we're
not afraid of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's modus operandi is to attack _ on defense. Riley is
notorious for three-hour practices if he is unhappy with his team,
and much of that time is spent working on fierce defense. They do
drills on ``blitzing,'' or double-teaming the pick-and-roll play;
on low-post defense, with a forearm in the offensive player's back;
on one-on-one defense, preventing penetration into the lane; on
aggressively trapping the ball; on double-teaming the low post, on
anything to stop the other team from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got drills on everything and we practice them at every
practice,'' Hardaway said. ``I know I've become a more complete
player because of the emphasis we put on playing defense. It's like
this: If you're going to win, you have to play tough defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley is the purveyor of that mentality. His Knicks teams of the
early 1990s played rugged defense and forced the league to crack
down on hand-checking. It was an unsightly approach, but they
advanced to the '94 NBA Finals, losing to the Houston Rockets in
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Riley said. ``You must develop a winning
culture to be a champion in this league, and the foundation of that
has to be defense. It's about effort, and it's about heart, and
it's about determination. At times, we put it together, and you
could think of unlimited results. Other times, there's slippage.''
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable and painful evidence of that came two
Sunday's ago, when Miami blew a 20-point lead at home to the hated
Knicks. It's a defeat that delayed the Heat coronation as Eastern
Conference champions _ and a win that catapulted New York into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two meet again in the first round. Their previous
series are unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   In '97 at Miami Arena, P.J. Brown picked up and tossed Charlie
Ward on his head under the basket, touching off a fracas that
involved every Knick. Leaving the bench during a melee is grounds
for suspension, so Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson
all had to sit out a game. Miami won the series.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at Madison Square Garden, Mourning and Johnson threw
punches at each other in a wild altercation that featured New York
coach Jeff Van Gundy holding onto Mourning's leg. The Heat was the
No. 2 seed, but with Mourning suspended, the Knicks advanced as the
seventh seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those incidents happened, but they are so removed from this
team now that it's not worth talking about,'' Riley said. ``But it
was a learning experience for everyone, especially 'Zo.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning's playoff flops are undeniable, but there's also no
denying that he has played this season with an edge, not over the
edge. He still lets out primal screams during the heat of the game,
but he has shown a restraint not seen in the past, when his
emotions hampered his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't here when that stuff happened,'' veteran guard Terry
Porter said, ``so all I can go by is this year. And this year,
'Zo's been awesome, totally professional. When he's in the lineup,
we know we have a chance to win against anybody. His presence gives
us a confidence that you get from a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we go as far as he takes us, because we all
have to play hard and well,'' Porter said. ``But if he's playing
like he's played this season, and we follow his lead, the sky's the
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   WHY MIAMI MIGHT WIN THE TITLE
</P>
<P>
   1. Their slow-it-down style. It matches the playoffs' pace. The
Heat thrive at a crawl, which is how they played all season.
</P>
<P>
   2. Their downright dogged defense. Miami always is in the game,
even when it can't score consistently, because the defense does not
allow big runs. At the same time, it can generate a decisive spurt.
</P>
<P>
   3. The dominance of Alonzo Mourning. He's the best big man in
the league. His 20-point scoring average is major, but more
important is the way he controls the lane and intimidates on
defense. On top of that, he's their emotional leader. His
enthusiasm permeates the team.
</P>
<P>
   4. Their point guard can create off the dribble in the clutch.
The Heat can clear out a side and allow Tim Hardaway to develop and
make shots for himself and his teammates. If he's double-teamed, he
is a cunning passer to the open man. If guarded in single coverage,
Hardaway is virtually undefendable.
</P>
<P>
   5. Home-court advantage through the conference playoffs. Miami
Arena is not exactly New York's Madison Square Garden or Utah's
Delta Center _ buildings where fans are rabid _ but even the
beachcombers of Miami would be ear-splittingly loud in a decisive
game.

HOUSTON ATTORNEY WITHDRAWS $260 MILLION CLAIM IN TOBACCO LEGAL
FEES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Texas _ A friend of former Attorney General Dan
Morales abruptly withdrew his claim for $260 million in legal fees
from Texas' tobacco case Thursday, one day after Attorney General
John Cornyn accused the two of trying to secure the payment by
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn predicted that Houston attorney Marc Murr's decision to
vacate the controversial award will end Murr's chances to cash in
on part of the $17.3 billion tobacco settlement negotiated by
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, a Republican who succeeded Democrat Morales on Jan. 1,
has accused his predecessor and Murr of falsifying signatures and
backdating two contracts in which Murr was hired to represent Texas
in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   While Morales has angrily denied Cornyn's claim that the
contracts were ``fake,'' Murr's attorney conceded to reporters
Thursday that the contracts may not have been signed on the dates
indicated. But the attorney, Roy Minton of Austin, said he didn't
think that was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, meanwhile, declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Murr's claim is over. This is a complete and total
victory for the state of Texas and Texas taxpayers,'' Cornyn said
after Minton asked U.S. District Judge David Folsom to vacate the
arbitration award.
</P>
<P>
   The judge gave Murr two months to reopen his request. But if he
sticks with Thursday's decision, he would still earn $1 million
from the tobacco settlement _ a fee set by a national arbitration
panel to be paid by the tobacco companies. Even so, other attorneys
in the case claim he did little or no work.
</P>
<P>
   Minton made his request to withdraw Murr's claim for $260
million in a brief courtroom hearing Thursday that followed
closed-door meetings between U.S. District Judge David Folsom and
the lawyers. &UR;  &LR; Murr didn't publicly comment.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort by Murr to reopen arbitration on his fee would be
fought again by Cornyn, who campaigned against big attorney fees
paid by the state. If Folsom were to allow more arbitration, Cornyn
presumably would help pick the new arbitrators, who could be less
receptive to Murr's application than the previous panel. The three
arbitrators who awarded Murr $260 million were retired judges
chosen by Murr and Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom, in an order setting the hearing, said that one of the
arbitrators was to be named by him.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has denied Cornyn's accusations about the preparation of
contracts that Morales and Murr purportedly signed on Oct. 17,
1996, and Jan. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the contracts ``fake,'' Cornyn said they didn't exist on
the dates they were supposedly signed.
</P>
<P>
   The October 1996 contract, Cornyn said, which provided a 3
percent contingency fee for Murr, actually wasn't created until
1998. He said the January 1997 agreement, which replaced the
earlier contract and promised Murr a ``reasonable'' fee, also was
created at a later date by shifting some signatures from another
document.
</P>
<P>
   Will Pryor, a former top assistant to Morales, said that he and
Murr both signed a contract Jan. 31, 1997, to assist Morales in the
tobacco suit. That was 10 months after the suit was filed and a
year before it was settled. Pryor, who by then was a mediator in
private practice in Dallas, said the contract called for him and
Murr to split a 6 percent contingency; it did not call for a
``reasonable'' fee, as Murr's contract on that date later stated.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he quit the case several weeks after signing it
because he felt uncomfortable with the arrangement. He said he was
worried questions might be raised because of his former close
association with Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Murr also has had an association with Morales, having known him
since the early 1980s. Murr also did some legal work for Morales
during one of his early political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn contends that Morales used Murr's signature on the
earlier contract, which included Pryor, to later create a separate
contract exclusively for Murr with the Jan. 31, 1997, date.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Travis County District Attorney's Office,
which is responsible for prosecuting state officials for criminal
wrongdoing, said he hadn't seen any evidence in Cornyn's
allegations that warranted a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusations added to questions already raised by other
lawyers, who contended Murr did little work on the suit. Although
Morales has insisted that Murr played a crucial role in the
landmark case, often as a behind-the-scenes adviser, Murr's name
didn't publicly surface until about the time the suit was settled
early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Minton said he has ``never known for sure'' when the October
1996 contract actually was signed. And of the January 1997
contract, he added, ``We have always known that was a document put
together sometime after Jan. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton said it wasn't unusual for lawyers to formalize
agreements in writing on different dates from which the agreements
actually were made.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schenkkan, an Austin attorney representing several state
legislators who have challenged the legal fees in the tobacco case,
said it was ``certainly true that not all backdated contracts are
illegal.'' But he said the Texas Constitution prohibits lawyers and
other contractors from being paid for work performed for the state
before a contract was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, backdating the contracts has great legal
significance,'' Schenkkan said. ``I think they (Murr and Minton)
should fold and go home. There is no way in a fair forum that Mr.
Murr will get any money at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn had subpoenaed Morales for possible testimony in
Thursday's hearing, but Morales successfully convinced Folsom to
quash the subpoena. Cornyn's allegations about fraud were raised in
his formal response to Morales' motion to quash.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said he was convinced his accusations
amounted to civil fraud on Morales' part, but he said he hadn't
determined yet if the allegations amounted to criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by each and every word that we wrote in our
response,'' Cornyn told reporters. ``We would have been ready to
present the witnesses to back up each and every word.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he hadn't decided what to do with his evidence now
but he didn't plan on making it public while his investigation
continued. He said the FBI also has been investigating Murr's role
in the tobacco suit.

 &HT;    Thrashers' draft lottery is May 16
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before Thrashers general manager Don Waddell has a
chance to test his skills as a talent evaluator, he has to hope for
a little luck.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL confirmed Thursday that the lottery-style drawing to
determine the first pick in the June 26 entry draft of amateur
players will be held May 16 in the league's New York office.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers and the 11 nonplayoff teams are in the lottery. No
team can move up more than four spots from its current position or
drop more than one. Therefore, only five teams _ Tampa Bay,
Atlanta, Vancouver, the New York Islanders and Nashville _ actually
have a shot at the first pick, and the Thrashers are guaranteed to
select first, second or third.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will be weighted second with Vancouver, behind
top-seeded Tampa Bay. Each team will be given an allotment of
numbers. The winning number will be determined by the four
ping-pong balls that pop out of a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Czech native Patrick Stefan, who played this season for Long
Beach in the International Hockey League, is considered the best
player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft to stock the Thrashers with players already
in the NHL will be June 25 in Boston.

MILOSEVIC SAYS HE THINKS `FAIR AGREEMENT' CAN BE REACHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic was quoted
Thursday as saying that he believed a ``fair agreement'' on Kosovo
could be reached in negotiations with the West, ending the bombing
and allowing the return of at least some refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary here, Milosevic's comment was delivered via the
state news agency Tanjug after the Yugoslav president met in
Belgrade with Karolos Papoulias, the former Greek foreign minister
and current head of the Greek Parliament's foreign affairs
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair agreement on all the unresolved issues can be achieved
in a political process with direct negotiations, and must involve
the end of attacks, the restoration of peace and the return of
Yugoslav citizens to their homes,'' Tanjug said in summing up
Milosevic's views.
</P>
<P>
   Tanjug added that an agreement was possible as long as it
respected all ethnic communities in the region, and preserved
Serbia's and Yugoslavia's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to Yugoslav citizens may prove problematic for
Kosovar Albanians who, when they fled or were forced out of the
province over the past six weeks, often had their identity papers
and other official documents burned by Serb security forces. They
could find it difficult to prove that they are Yugoslav citizens.
Serb media have long asserted that a substantial number of the
Kosovar Albanians _ thought to number 1.8 million, or 90 percent of
the province's population before the war _ had immigrated illegally
from neighboring Albania, and were never Yugoslav citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the Group of Seven most industrialized
nations plus Russia announced agreement on principles for ending
the crisis over Kosovo. There was no immediate official response in
Belgrade to the plan, but during the day, government officials
spoke favorably about the chances for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade enjoyed another quiet night Wednesday, the third in a
row that has been free of bombing, adding to hopes in the city that
the leadership is inching toward an end to the war. Fuel depots in
the towns of Nis, Kraljevo and Prahovo to the south and east of
Belgrade were hit overnight, and a fierce fire was reported to have
taken hold in Nis, southern Serbia's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Belgrade, minds were concentrated on diplomacy. Some
members of the government kept up their strident anti-NATO rhetoric
and continued to reject the possibility of foreign troops in
Kosovo. Most seemed, however, to support the process of negotiation
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The latest gesture from the government has been to allow Ibrahim
Rugova, a Kosovo Albanian political leader, to travel to Italy with
his family. Rugova had been living in Kosovo under what the Serbs
called police protection and NATO called house arrest for the last
six weeks. He recently signed a peace agreement for Kosovo with
Serb President Milan Milutinovic, a close ally of Milosevic, and _
after almost 10 years of being virtually ignored by Belgrade _ is
now being singled out as an Albanian leader from Kosovo who is
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of Ibrahim Rugova's mission in Italy is to search for
a political settlement and continue with the political process,''
said Ivica Dacic, the spokesman for Milosevic's ruling Socialist
Party. He added that Rugova's trip to Italy was proof that he had
not been detained in Kosovo against his will.
</P>
<P>
   Dacic also held out a promise for negotiations on an
international force in Kosovo. The force had to be a U.N. mission,
he said, and the mandate, formation and time frame for the force
could be agreed upon, but ``only in direct talks'' between the
United Nations and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav United Left, the party headed by Mirjana Markovic,
the influential wife of Milosevic, issued a statement on Wednesday
saying that a diplomatic political solution was required for
Kosovo. The party had ``always been committed to negotiation,''
quoted the Beta news agency. It did not, however, go further than
the usual proposed ``U.N. presence'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme nationalist Vojislav Seselj, a deputy prime minister
and leader of the Serbian Radical Party, rejected any possibility
of foreign troops entering Yugoslavia, saying that only civilian
observers would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed and nothing will be changed in our
policy,'' he said at a news conference in his party headquarters.
``We have nothing to discuss with the Americans, the French, the
English or the Germans about our internal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Seselj fills the role of the West's most extreme opponent in the
government and does not necessarily reflect the immediate
intentions of the president. He admitted himself that he had
opposed the release of the three U.S. soldiers last week without
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for them to be tried on charges of terrorism because
they were involved in war against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia,'' he said. But Milosevic ``decided to release them,
according to his constitutional right, and there is nothing
dramatic in that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same breath, Seselj voiced effusive praise for ``the
great activist'' Rev. Jesse Jackson who, he said, came to Belgrade
to ask for the soldiers' release. Jackson's visit received huge and
enthusiastic coverage in Serbia's official media.
</P>
<P>
   Local analysts, citing sources close to the leadership, claim
that Milosevic is now ready to accept a lightly armed United
Nations mission in Kosovo, as long as it does not contain troops
from those NATO countries heavily involved in the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The message being conveyed to the public in Belgrade is that
NATO needs a deal as much as Belgrade does. The government line
continually given out by officials and in the media is that NATO is
stuck in a bombing campaign that it cannot win and is desperate to
find a way out. Another opinion often aired by the censored media
is that the West will buckle before Yugoslavia will, either because
of strains and differences within NATO or because Western
democracies will not find the resolve to prosecute a lengthy war.

   Gonzales, 28, adds, ``I'm older, so I can't stand living
someplace that looks ratty.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether snapping up bathroom fixtures at Home Depot,
shrink-wrapped T-shirts at Old Navy or wide-screen televisions at
Circuit City, American consumers are on a rampage, increasing their
spending even faster than they did last year. In the first four
months of this year, sales in stores open at least one year rose
6.7 percent from the corresponding period last year, one of the
biggest jumps in years, according to the Goldman Sachs retail
composite index. That increase comes on top of a dizzying 5.1
percent increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   For growth in consumption to actually accelerate after eight
years of economic expansion is a surprise _ the torrid pace had
been expected to slow. Retail analysts and economists now point to
numerous factors, including the continued rise of both the stock
market and home values, to explain much of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   But another change is also helping: While the wealthiest
consumers powered the expansion in its early stages, spending by
those in the bottom 40 percent of income, defined as households
making up to $28,500 a year, has been picking up. Real growth in
wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years have spread the
shopping spree into every corner of American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that for the first time in two-and-a-half
decades, workers' broad-based wage gains are generally driving
consumption throughout the economy,'' said Jared Bernstein, an
economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute based in
Washington. ``It is not just the wealth bubble at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first years of the economy's expansion, middle- and
low-income Americans increased their spending, but at a much slower
pace than wealthy households, those making over $47,000.
Consumption by those earning less than $28,500 grew 10 percent from
1993 (a nadir in consumer spending for this group) through 1997,
whereas spending by the richest fifth of Americans, those earning
over $73,000, grew 25 percent, according to Edward Wolff, an
economist at New York University who has analyzed the federal
government's Consumer Expenditure Survey. Wolff projects that this
will change when the government data are made available for 1998.
Spending by the group making less than $47,000 will have grown by 5
percent, he estimates, and spending by the richest by only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the inflation-adjusted pay of the bottom 20 percent
of wage earners has grown 5 percent to 10 percent since 1996 while
their savings rate has hovered around zero, economists say it is
safe to conclude that their additional earnings are going to new
purchases. The earned-income tax credit (expanded in 1994) has also
given them some additional buying power.
</P>
<P>
   But low earners are taking on additional debt too, as credit
card companies court them and federal programs encourage them to
buy their own homes and assume mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get the '98 and '99 data, it will become very clear
that they are accounting for a very sizable share of the growth in
consumer spending,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for RFA,
an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   All this is not to discount the spending power of the rich. As
the biggest beneficiaries of sharp gains in the stock market, the
wealthiest fifth of Americans are consuming as conspicuously as
ever. Their intense appetite for luxury items has created a boom
market for upscale cars and for homes that rival the gaudiest
mansions of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the giddy spending is the fierce resurgence of the
ultimate income showpiece: fur. Not only are mink stoles in fashion
for the fall, but designers are using fancy animal pelts for all
manner of clothing from sweaters of royal blue chinchilla to skirts
in shearling.
</P>
<P>
   But if the rich are enjoying a sumptuous banquet, the remainder
of Americans are not just scooping up table scraps, as many critics
of Reaganomics argued was the case in the 1980s expansion. In
everything from apparel to electronics to home furnishings, these
Americans are making their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, they are speeding the rise of value-oriented
emporiums and highlighting the growing troubles of retailers that
cater to the middle market. In previous economic booms, low-income
people tended to trade up to more expensive stores. This time
around, they are sticking with those that offer them the best
deals, and they are being joined by more affluent Americans, who
are increasingly willing to shop both in chichi boutiques and in
stores that offer cut-rate prices.
</P>
<P>
   In previous months, the surging buying power of lower earners
has helped move Target Stores, Kmart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
to the head of the retail pack. In April, sales at discount stores
rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs,
much slower than in previous months but still impressive
considering that Easter sales were recorded in March this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-CONSUMER-SPENDING-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: this year. &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This segment is winning big because it has transformed itself
from pragmatic but grim to stylish yet affordable. Target, a unit
of Dayton Hudson Corp., is the most obvious practitioner of the
strategy, but not its only one. It employs a brigade of trend
hunters who bring the hippest clothing designs to the stores in a
timely manner and recently unveiled a home design collection by the
renowned architect Michael Graves, featuring retro-chic tea kettles
and toasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago there were no major brands in the discounters;
then somebody finally woke up,'' said Adelle Kirk, director of
marketing for Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm.
``These days discounters very successfully deliver fashion,
terrific merchandising, and brands _ all at value prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market researchers argue that the more polished approach,
in the best tradition of retail, is doing more than simply filling
a need. It is also creating new desires to fuel the economy. In
other words, home-and-hearth avatar Martha Stewart, whose products
are now available at Kmart stores, is making 200-thread-count
cotton bed sheets in sunflower yellow something that most every
American can aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Clark, 21, has two jobs, one as a data entry clerk at a
bank and another as a cashier at a grocery store. She says she
regularly visits Target in her home town of Memphis, even on
evenings when she goes out with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always spend way too much when I come here, but I always
find other things to buy,'' Ms. Clark laments. ``Today I came to
buy detergent and fabric softener, and I ended up with two plastic
lawn chairs, plants, electronic games, candles, socks and a utility
knife. I thought I would spend maybe $25, but I spent $106 instead.
Every time I come here, I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other winners in this environment are also stores that
emphasize good value. This includes Home Depot Inc. and the
electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc. Old Navy, the stylish
low-cost clothing chain started by the Gap in 1994, has also
repeatedly registered double-digit sales growth in the last year
and reported a 7 percent increase in the latest monthly sales
report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, stores that cater to the middle class, like Sears,
Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co., are finding it hard to get
solid footing. Both stores Thursday reported slight sales declines
in April from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc, said,
``The companies who are losing market share need to reposition
themselves as value leaders, or they are not going to last.'' &QL;

REBEL FORCE WILL NOT DISARM, KLA OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ A senior Kosovo Liberation Army official said
on Thursday that the guerrilla force would not allow itself to be
disarmed, a central tenet of the proposed peace deal unveiled by
Western and Russian diplomats in Germany earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Jakup Krasniqi, said, ``After all that has
happened in Kosovo we cannot discuss anymore the disarming of the
KLA,'' Krasniqi said. But when pressed, Krasniqi said KLA soldiers
``would never'' fight peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi, a high-ranking KLA political official who was a member
of the Kosovar delegation to the peace talks in Rambouillet,
France, also said that the guerrilla group would only support a
peace deal involving a NATO-led military force entering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And in a signal of a widening rift in the Kosovar leadership, he
openly attacked Ibrahim Rugova, the longtime Kosovar political
leader who was abruptly allowed to fly to Italy on Wednesday after
being held in Yugoslavia for six weeks under conditions NATO
officials described as ``house arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi denounced Rugova a ``traitor'' after Yugoslav officials
announced days after NATO bombing began that the moderate Albanian
leader, who had sought a nonviolent solution to Kosovo's problems,
had reached a political settlement with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand a clear statement of support of our war aims and the
full withdrawal of all Serb forces in Kosovo,'' Krasniqi said. ``We
also demand from Rugova a public explanation for all events and his
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that NATO will continue to be firm in its own stance
that they will accept nothing less than a NATO-led force to enter
Kosovo. After all, this is the reason why the bombing started,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of the possibility of partitioning Kosovo, he
said, ``Partition is not acceptable. If any plan about partition of
Kosovo is put on the table, you can be sure that not only the KLA
but all the people of Kosovo will oppose it to the last man.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials, particularly Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia and author of the Rambouillet Accord, have
backed Rugova as the true leader of the Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians. But KLA officials insist they are now the true voice of
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats and Clinton administration officials have
downplayed the importance of the KLA, dismissing them as a highly
disorganized, overly secretive and largely ineffective fighting
force with little political support among Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the expulsions of over 600,000 ethnic
Albanians from the province in the last six weeks, the group's
standing appears to have soared among refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has proven to be a wild-card in the past, with the KLA
leaders' initial refusal to sign the Rambouillet peace accord
catching administration officials off-guard and complicating
American efforts to pressure Milosevic into signing the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians will be able to live again in Kosovo with Serbs
``who did not commit crimes,'' Krasniqi predicted. And he added
that Serbs in Kosovo, who made up roughly 10 percent of the
population before the expulsions began, should receive the same
treatment as ``every other minority in democratic Europe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Krasniqi said that the guerrilla force was voluntary but
functioned at a ``professional'' military level.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists from The Times of London and the Reuters News Agency
who spent several days on the KLA's front lines in Albania this
week reported the group's success had been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In fighting over the last month that produced hundreds of
casualties, KLA forces have driven three miles into Kosovo, they
said. But the guerrillas have been unable to completely break
Serbian lines and create a corridor for ferrying supplies to
encircled units inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   KLA forces do appear better armed and organized than they did a
year ago, they said. The guerrillas now trade mortar fire with
Serbian units inside Kosovo and displayed large numbers of mortars,
recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms
and ammunition, much of it made in China. But the soldiers
themselves appeared inexperienced and the KLA is clearly
benefiting, they said, from NATO bombing attacks that keep Serb
forces pinned down along the border.

HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS COORDINATING STRATEGY WITH BUSH CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional leaders are working with Texas Gov.
George Bush on a coordinated campaign strategy for next year's
elections, in another sign of Bush's status as the top Republican
in Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the traditional reluctance to get involved in
party nomination battles, House GOP leaders are treating Bush
almost as if he were the Republican nominee. Both camps hope that
the cooperation will pay off in an election that gives Republicans
bigger majorities in Congress as well as control of the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to run as a candidate who can work with the
Republican Congress,'' Bush spokesman Dave Beckwith said. ``We're
trying to make sure we're on the same page because we want to
cooperate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Bush is looking to members of Congress to help him
develop positions on national issues and for political intelligence
from their home states. More than 90 of the 222 House Republicans
have expressed support for Bush's candidacy, although some have not
formally endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   His most ardent supporters include two top House leaders from
Texas, Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving and GOP Whip Tom DeLay
of Sugar Land. Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois is publicly
neutral, but he is also considered part of the Bush team.
</P>
<P>
   Others who are actively advancing Bush's cause on Capitol Hill
are Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, Rep.
Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who was
selected as Bush's official liason to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ties with the Senate are not as strong, largely because
two senators _ Bob Smith of New Hampshire and John McCain of
Arizona _ are also seeking the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the two Texans, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison,
the governor's chief ally in the Senate is Sen. Paul Coverdell of
Georgia. Bush is hosting a fund-raiser for Senate Majority Trent
Lott of Mississippi this weekend, but Lott is officially neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the endorsement of just about everyone up here. There
are a lot of open lines of communication,'' one House leadership
aide said. ``It's definitely unique. I've never seen anything like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cooperation has its limits. Bush has mildly criticized
the Republican-controlled House for refusing to endorse the air war
in Yugoslavia now that it is under way. DeLay helped scuttle a
resolution of support by lobbying against it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush has reassured congressional leaders that
he will not make Congress-bashing part of his presidential campaign
strategy. In 1996, Republican nominee Bob Dole tried to distance
himself from Congress in an election year that resulted in GOP
losses on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cooperating. We're not going to run against Congress,''
Beckwith said.

FORMER SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER NAMED TO INQUIRY INTO MASS KILLINGS
IN RWANDA   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Sweden, Rwanda, France, Belgium)   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has chosen Ingvar
Carlsson, a former Swedish prime minister, as co-chairman of an
inquiry into the U.N. role in the mass killings in Rwanda in 1994,
diplomats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsson, 64, was prime minister between 1986 and 1991 following
the assassination of Olof Palme, and again between 1994 and 1996
and is known as a discreet, reserved man. He also served as a
co-chairman of the Commission on Global Governance, a private panel
that explored what could be done to ease world conflict and make
government more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report, issued in early 1995, explored at some
length the Hutu-inspired massacre of more than 500,000 Tutsi and
moderate Hutu in 1994. The panel recommended that the U.N. charter
be amended to permit the use of force to address human rights
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from the Swedish embassy declined to comment Thursday
on the appointment, and Carlsson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about their views of Carlsson, whose appointment Annan is
expected to announce as early as Friday, human rights monitors
expressed relief and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If confirmed, the selection of such a strong, independent
figure would mean that the panel is likely to insist on a tough
investigation, and that means that the inquiry will be credible,''
said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of the New York-based
Human Rights Watch. The private human rights group had harshly
criticized the United Nations, as well as France, Belgium, and the
United States for failing to prevent the genocide and for doing too
little to stop it once it began.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his intention two months ago to launch the
inquiry, Annan said he was doing so because of the scale of the
killings and the questions that ``continue to surround the actions
of the United Nations immediately before and during the period of
the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision followed widespread criticism not only of Security
Council actions before and during the massacres, but also of Annan,
who was at the time heading the organization's peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The identify of the other panelists could not be learned
Thursday.

THERE'S HOPE FOR CLIPPERS _ HONEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers' future? Even the Psychic
Hotline wouldn't touch that one.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consult history to see if it provides any clues. Fifteen
years in L.A. have produced 14 losing seasons. The past certainly
has been gruesome enough, but the franchise is threatening to turn
the corner after losing 41 of 50 games in the just-completed
lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, the Clippers will ditch the Sports Arena,
travel north on Figueroa and hang a right at the Convention Center.
Looming just a 3-pointer away will be the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The first change to be made after that is their look. When most
sentences expire, prisoners are released with a new suit of
clothes. Following that protocol, the Clippers will wear new
uniforms next season. Mum's the word on the color scheme, but
figuring out who will be modeling Clippers costumes when the next
season erupts should be a bit easier.
</P>
<P>
   Following this evolution, a prioritized list of Clippers
questions:
</P>
<P>
   What about Maurice Taylor? This one's easy. If owner Donald T.
Sterling decides to grant his second-year power forward the maximum
contract extension (roughly six years, $70 million) before training
camp begins, there is hope. If he doesn't, there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a distraction we don't need,'' said first-year
Clippers coach Chris Ford, in reference to the prospect of not
making a financial commitment to his leading scorer. ``Offensively,
he certainly is an awesome talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he needs to do more. He has to prove he can get the
rebounds that are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Michael Olowokandi, the Clippers' selection with the first
pick in the 1998 NBA draft, become a good NBA center? Yes. But you
had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight Clippers no longer under contract, who is expected
to return? The best bets to stay are shooting guard Eric
Piatkowski, undrafted rookie small forward Tyrone Nesby and veteran
point guard Sherman Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the long shots to return? Forwards Lamond Murray and
Rodney Rogers, center Stojko Vrankovic (who represents $4 million
in salary-cap gravy) and point guard Darrick Martin figure to be
goners.
</P>
<P>
   This abundance of contractual lame ducks certainly didn't help
the season-opening 0-17 effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use it as an excuse,'' Ford said, ``but it's a
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Lorenzen Wright? The versatile and dedicated low-post
reserve was offered a six-year, $30 million contract extension the
day after he grabbed 25 rebounds in a victory over Sacramento. He
and his agent turned it down. Ford would like Wright to return, but
the Clippers won't re-sign him for the Wright price.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be this summer's draft target? Ask again after
underclass hot shots Lamar Odom (Rhode Island) and Baron Davis
(UCLA) make decisions on their immediate futures. However, you
would think point guard is a main concern.
</P>
<P>
   Is Ford a good coach? Yes. But you had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   He also is a classy person and a fine judge of talent. If Elgin
Baylor (the executive director of basketball operations)
assimilates as much personnel input from Ford as from his
predecessor, Bill Fitch, future rosters will look much better.

<P>
   Does this franchise have hope? Well, this answer may seem
anathema to its past, but the franchise does possess some sound
basketball minds. Jeff Weltman, the director of player personnel,
has helped turn the roster into a basketball Pygmalion. He was
smart enough to endorse CBA workers Nesby and Troy Hudson, a
stunning find at point guard. Baylor was wise enough to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Will Sterling make the proper financial commitments? Pass. Sure,
we know where most of you would put the smart money, but even
Nostradamus didn't have the guts to call a bookie.

 Labor Peace Plan
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Phil Grauss brings a fresh new attitude to the job these days when
he dispenses pills and advice to patients at the Kaiser pharmacy in
Petaluma.
</P>
<P>
   Grauss is a leader of the Engineers and Scientists Union of
California, which recently signed its first contract with Kaiser
after an organizing drive made relatively amicable as a result of a
novel partnership between the HMO and a coalition of labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Kaiser Permanente and most of its unions agreed
to solve problems in a cooperative fashion. It included Kaiser's
promise to make it easier for unions to organize workers, and added
union members to labor-management quality councils.
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage has been controversial. Not all the unions have
signed on. Noticeably absent is the California Nurses Association,
which believes unions should keep management at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the partnership is being closed watched. ``This is
the largest, most complex labor-management partnership in the
country, perhaps the world,'' said Pete diCicco, an official with
the AFL-CIO, who is coordinating the union end of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Grauss' union has been one of the beneficiaries of the alliance.
It took four years of organizing before Kaiser made the 1,000
pharmacists an initial contract offer in December. After they
rejected it, Kaiser made a second offer in January for raises of 7
to 14 percent, which the union accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite how long it took to make the deal, Grauss is grateful
that, through the 2-year-old partnership between Kaiser and 20
California local unions, the HMO decided not to use legal tactics
that could have delayed a contract indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of partnership is going to work rather well,'' said
Grauss, who, as a result of the partnership, now sits on
labor-management committees to improve pharmacy service.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Oakland headquarters of the California Nurses
Association, union leader Jim Ryder speaks bitterly about ``the
sham of a partnership'' which Grauss and other union leaders
christened in spring 1997 _ while CNA nurses were striking because
the HMO had offered them a contract calling for cuts in wage and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNA feels the partnership was used by Kaiser in an attempt to
defeat us,'' says Ryder, who's proud of CNA's absence from the
partnership and the militant tactics it continues to employ against
Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between CNA's in-your-face attitude and Grauss'
patient persistence underscores the controversial nature of the
partnership, which Kaiser forged with 20 of the 25 locals that
represent the vast majority of its 70,000 California employees.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface the partnership is simple, says Dick Pettingill,
president of Kaiser's California division. ``We're creating an
environment where labor and management can sit around a table and
solve their problems with less friction, which should improve the
way we deliver patient care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marlayne Morgan, assistant business manager of Grauss' union,
points out that Kaiser also has some very practical reasons for
making an alliance with its unions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many of Kaiser's paying members have always come
from union-paid insurance plans. As a result of the partnership,
the AFL-CIO promised to encourage other unions to join Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't just do this out of the goodness of their
hearts,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dany Valenzuela, Kaiser's director of labor relations in
California, says despite having had its share of strikes over its
50-year history, Kaiser had also seen itself as basically
pro-union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked across the table from each other and said, `We are
not each other's enemy,''' Valenzuela says, explaining the
labor-management pact.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Rosselli, president of Service Employees International Union
Local 250, agrees, at least, that Kaiser isn't labor's  &LR; worst
 &LR; enemy.
</P>
<P>
   If Grauss' union is the poster child for the partnership,
Rosselli's union is its chief advocate and largest member. SEIU
local 250 represents 16,000 Northern California Kaiser workers who
do every job except those of doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the largest health care unions, not just here but
nationwide, SEIU views the partnership as a way to nurse its
strength. By collaborating with the generally labor-friendly
Kaiser, SEIU reserves its picket-power for the employers it
considers more hostile, like Sutter and Catholic Health Care West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaiser isn't perfect, but it's the least offensive,'' Rosselli
says. ``They've done one big thing no other health care employer
has done _ include the rank-and-file people who provide health care
at the same table, in equal numbers, with physicians and managers
to make decisions about how care should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   One big omission in the partnership is the CNA, which has kept
its 8,000 Northern California Kaiser nurses out of this portrait of
Kaiser's labor-management conclave.
</P>
<P>
   Rosselli says CNA stands virtually alone among the larger unions
in shunning the partnership. Nurses in Southern California, and in
other states where Kaiser has offices, have joined SEIU and the
other unions in what is a national pact.
</P>
<P>
   But CNA has prominent allies who say it, and not the SEIU-led
union majority, is the best guardian of both union and consumer
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNA is the lighthouse for labor in the entire country,'' says
consumer activist Ralph Nader. ``They have all the old-fashioned
sense of proper militancy versus management.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader says CNA willingness to confront Kaiser, not just on pay
hikes, bit on issues like Kaiser's bid to close its hospital in
Oakland, make it a better consumer advocate than the
``deal-cutters'' at SEIU.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Anderson, who represents SEIU and the other unions in
the partnership, dismisses his critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Nader wouldn't know a hospital from an airline hanger,''
says Anderson. ``He ran out of issues a decade ago and he's been
trying to get involved with health care, when he doesn't live here
and he doesn't know anything about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this, the sniping among labor factions, and the desire of
management to make public relations hay out of the partnership, has
a familiar ring to Gil Preuss, a professor at Case Western Reserve
University who has studied labor-management partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't new, but they are new to health care,'' says
Preuss, who says the steel, auto and communications industries
forged partnerships in the 1970s and 1980s, when their fields were
undergoing dramatic change caused by competition or deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's the most pressure on organizations, both sides
have the most incentive to choose one of two paths,'' Preuss says,
``either traditional adversarial relations or closer integration
and cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure certainly describes the health care industry in
September 1995, when former SEIU national leader John Sweeney, now
head of the AFL-CIO, placed a private call to Kaiser Chairman David
Lawrence. Cost cutting by insurance firms and government agencies
had the put the screws on HMOs, who turned around and sought
layoffs and wage rollbacks from workers, setting labor and
management at each other's throats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we had our first meeting in secret at the
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport because we weren't sure where all this
was going,'' Lawrence says.
</P>
<P>
   That was in early 1996. It was more than a year before Kaiser
and the SEIU-led union coalition hammered out a written agreement
calling, in essence, for the two sides to bargain in a less
confrontational manner. SEIU and other union members voted
overwhelmingly to ratify the partnership in May 1997 _ while CNA
nurses were still staging walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser eventually withdrew its wage giveback demands and offered
all its Northern California unions, both its partners and the CNA,
small wage hikes. Leaders on both sides of the union divide still
debate whether it was CNA militancy or partner patience that won
those raises.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the contending factions argue about whether the
partnership is really giving rank-and-file workers a say in how
Kaiser does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Orwell's Animal Farm, you don't just get in there
and start playing manager,'' says Pete diCicco, the AFL-CIO
official who heads the partnership coalition. He cites successes,
like the new attitude at Kaiser's South San Francisco facility, a
former labor-management sore spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're down to two grievances there from hundreds
before the partnership,'' says diCicco, who attributes the change
to ``the fact that we talk differently to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Also open to debate is which approach better serves patients,
CNA picketing _ nurses rallied this week in Oakland to protest the
proposed closure of Kaiser's hospital _ or the worker-management
committees that are sprouting up throughout Kaiser's far-flung
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Preuss, the Case Western professor, says his research holds
lessons for both sides. Preuss has studied a labor-management
partnership that began in 1984, involving 14 hospitals and several
unions in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Though much smaller than
the Kaiser experiment, the Twin Cities partnership suggested that,
over time, cooperation yielded better staff-to-patient ratios and
other measures that improved care.
</P>
<P>
   But in what seems like a warning to labor, the 14 hospitals that
startedthe partnership have settled into three camps: one that
still hews to the cooperative line, one that has turned against the
unions and one somewhere in between.

 Interviewers Who Don't Call Back
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I had a job interview on March 31, and the company told
me they'd be making a decision by April 9. April 9 passed and,
several days later, I called to find out what they had decided.
They told me that the interviewer was on vacation until April 26,
that a decision would be made upon his return and that I still was
a candidate. Now it's May, and I still haven't heard from them. Is
there a tactful way to inquire again, or should I wait for them to
contact me?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  By all means, call them. It's completely reasonable to
want to know what's happening with this job. In fact, the company
may even view polite persistence as a sign that you're really
interested in this position _ or as evidence you know how to follow
up and get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure you're polite and friendly when you call, of course. You
could say something like, ``Hi, I just wanted to let you know I'm
still extremely interested in that job. Do you know when you might
have a decision? Would it be OK if I checked back with you next
week?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, don't take these delays personally. It's tempting to
get paranoid and assume that you're out of the running, but the
company may simply be moving slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is really typical,'' said Abby Snay, executive
director of Jewish Vocational Services in San Francisco. ``It seems
like over the past few years, the hiring processes have really
gotten extended. Sometimes a company's staff is so thin that people
have multiple tasks and just have to squeeze hiring in between
everything else. Or they try to make hiring more collaborative, and
it takes time to get input from numerous people.''
</P>
<P>
   Think  &LR; you've &LR;  got problems? Career counselor Lois Reed, program
director at Alumnae Resources in San Francisco, had a client who
was forced to call one potential employer 32 separate times.
</P>
<P>
   In the end? She got the job. ``Persistence pays off,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Fees
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently left my job and was told that I had to pay a $75
processing fee in order to take my 401(k) investments with me. Is
this legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no rule against charging a processing fee like the
one you describe. But such fees must meet three criteria, according
to Bette Briggs, regional director of the U.S. Pension &AMP; Welfare
Benefits Administration:
</P>
<P>
   _The fees must be authorized in the ``plan document,'' the
document that lays out the rules for your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   _The fees must be reasonable and related to actual costs
connected with your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   _The fees must be levied consistently on all accounts: The
company can't charge a fee to one employee while exempting another.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your plan administrator (who probably is your old employer)
for a copy of the plan document, if you don't have one in your
files. Read through it to see if it authorizes such a fee.
</P>
<P>
   You may have two bases for complaint here _ if the fee isn't
mentioned in the plan document, or if it's much higher than the
actual costs it supposed covers. (A $75 fee sounds awfully high.)
</P>
<P>
   Present your concerns to the human resources folks at your old
company. If that doesn't help, call your local office of the
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. In the Bay Area, you
can reach the PWBA at (415) 975-4600.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Statements
</P>
<P>
   Q: My company recently moved our 401(k) funds from one financial
management firm to another. The last statement we received from the
former firm covered the period from April through June 1998. The
initial statement for the new firm started at September 1998. I
have asked for a statement covering July and August but have gotten
nowhere. The new firm said it must come from the old firm, but the
old firm says it's impossible to provide. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Most 401(k) plans only are required to issue annual
financial statements. There's no law saying they must issue
quarterly statements _ let alone monthly statements like you're
seeking for July and August.
</P>
<P>
   The central question here is whether all your funds were
transferred correctly to the new management firm. You should be
able to roughly answer that by comparing those two statements
covering June and September _ taking into account how much money
you deposit in your 401(k) each pay period, while allowing for some
growth or shrinkage due to fund performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to compare the two statements,'' said Briggs of the
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. ``See if the numbers
add up. If there's a problem, alert the plan administrator or call
our office.''
</P>
<P>
   More 401(k) questions? Along with its help line at (415)
975-4600, the PWBA offers a range of free brochures relating to
pension and retirement plans. For copies, call (800) 998-7542 or

SHOULD BE BOURQUE'S YEAR FOR THE NORRIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had to be a shock to the greater metropolitan New York area
that Brian Leetch's name didn't _ didn't _ make the honor roll
Wednesday when the National Hockey League announced the finalists
for the Norris Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, what horror.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch has been named the league's top defenseman twice, in 1992
and '97. Now, I hate to cast a quizzical eye at the Professional
Hockey Writers Association, because I am a longtime dues-paying
member, but when I think of all the attributes that should be in
the Norris mix _ first and foremost dotting all the I's and
crossing all the T's in the defensive zone _ Leetch's image doesn't
exactly sprinkle into my mind like so much pixie dust.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of things in New York, Leetch's talents are vastly
overblown. I say this realizing that in the next few weeks he
likely will sign a new deal with the Rangers worth an average of $8
million or $9 million a year over the next four or five seasons. He
has ample hardware on his shelf _ including that '94 Stanley Cup _
and the lack of endorsement from here in the Hub of Hockey, even if
he is a former BC Eagle, won't make his morning cup of coffee turn
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins captain Ray Bourque, back on the ice for the start of the
Boston-Buffalo second-round playoff series, again made the list of
finalists, alongside Detroit heavy hitter Nicklas Lidstrom and St.
Louis sharpshooter Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've lost count, let's review: This is the 14th time
in 20 seasons that Bourque has made the final cut. He has won the
Norris five times ('87, '88, '90, '91, and '94) and has finished
runner-up five times ('82, '85, '92, '93, and '96). The award was
first presented in 1954 (Red Kelly, Detroit), and no one else has
as many first- and second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Will Bourque win it this year? He'd get my vote (full
disclosure: I wasn't asked to vote). By my count, Bourque should be
pocketing his 11th or 12th Norris this year. That said, I sincerely
doubt he'll upset MacInnis, the sentimental favorite.
</P>
<P>
   No question, MacInnis is a worthy candidate. The same goes for
Lidstrom, who also can pound the puck from the point and has the
added cachet of being instrumental in two straight Cup wins. By the
time the Norris is presented in Toronto June 24, Lidstrom very well
could have a third Cup victory _ and no doubt Bourque would empty
out his own trophy case for just one Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Word around the league since midseason has been that the
35-year-old MacInnis will be a Norris shoo-in. He's a good guy, an
ever-willing interview (believe me, it counts in the balloting),
and has finished runner-up twice, both times to Bourque ('90 and
'91).
</P>
<P>
   If MacInnis wins, he'll be the beneficiary of democratic
thinking, PHWA voters distributing the vote for the sake of
breaking away from the list of suspects. It has happened before in
Norris voting. Witness 1981, when Pittsburgh's Randy Carlyle won
his one and only Norris. Carlyle had talent, and he helped make a
moribund Penguin franchise fun, but he didn't have Norris talent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of the names who won in the year leading up to
Carlyle's triumph: How about Bobby Orr (eight straight), Denis
Potvin (three out of four years), and Larry Robinson (two out of
four years, including the year before Carlyle was selected)? But
Carlyle put in his time and he finished with decent numbers _ 647
points and a surprising 1,400 penalty minutes. He clearly was not
the game's best blue-liner that year (Potvin and Bourque were
better choices), but you just never know what happens when the
polls are open.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque is still the game's best defenseman, when we talk about
all the elements of the job, defense first, and then all other
factors given even weight from there _ leading the breakout, puck
control, innate sense of when to join the rush, when to pinch,
quarterback the power play, hold the blue line, and oh, yeah, point
production. Points should be considered last of all, but that
thinking hasn't been invoked since the early '80s, when Rod Langway
deservedly won the Norris twice for his air-tight defense in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL awards are based solely on play in the regular season.
The reason for that is obvious: Only 16 of the NHL's Original 27
teams qualify for Cup contention. But did we need a better case for
Bourque being the league's best defenseman than the double OT game
in Greensboro, N.C., last week? The 38-year-old amassed no fewer
than 53-plus minutes in a 95-minute game. He had some 40 percent
more minutes than any other blue-liner, on either side, and he
still was at his metronomic best when Anson Carter popped in the
winner. Don't forget, Bourque had the second assist.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, No. 77 was back on the beat, helping to shape
Boston's postseason fortunes. Much has been made during these
playoffs about the players who haven't suited up, either because
their teams were eliminated or they were injured. We can be
thankful, though, that Bourque, MacInnis, and Lidstrom all made it
to Round 2. Your homework over the next 7-10 days: Examine the play
of all three, and report back if you sincerely think MacInnis or
Lidstrom is better than Bourque. What, your dog ate your homework?
Understood.

FUGITIVE ABORTION FOE CHARGED WITH MURDERING CLINIC DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Canada)  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Hoping to intensify what is already an
international manhunt, law enforcement officials Thursday charged
James Kopp, a roving abortion protester, with murdering a Buffalo
abortion clinic doctor in a sniper attack last October.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities admitted they had no idea where Kopp was or
whether he was even on this continent. But, they said, they hoped
that by upgrading the warrant against him to one for murder they
could heighten the interest of the public and police agencies in
the United States and abroad. Until Thursday, Kopp had been
classified only as a material witness in the killing of the doctor,
Barnett Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today to tell you that this man is our suspect and he
should be charged with the death of Dr. Slepian,'' said Bernard
Tolbert, the agent in charge of the FBI's Buffalo office, at a news
conference featuring a battery of top federal, state and local law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will find this man,'' he vowed. ``We may find him in
western New York. We may find him in the United States. We may find
him internationally. But we will find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopp faces charges on state and federal levels, and both carry
maximum penalties of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for western New York, Denise O'Donnell, filed
a complaint Wednesday charging Kopp with ``using deadly force to
prevent Dr. Barnett Slepian from providing reproductive health
services,'' a violation of the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, filed a
complaint in criminal court in Amherst, the Buffalo suburb where
the 52-year-old obstetrician was slain, charging Kopp with
intentional murder in the second degree, which carries a maximum
penalty of 25 years to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that at this point the case did not seem to meet any
of the categories of crime covered by New York's death penalty law,
like multiple murder or murder in the commission of another felony.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the charges Thursday, law enforcement officials,
who said they had no evidence so far that Kopp had been helped by
anyone, offered a few new details about the Slepian investigation.
In an interview, Clark said the authorities had identified a rifle
unearthed in April in the woods behind Slepian's home as the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had
traced the history of the rifle, but he refused to give any
information about its make or caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was slain at about 10 p.m. Oct. 23 by a single gunshot
that was fired through a rear window and struck him as he stood in
his kitchen. The sniper fired from woods about 100 feet away,
buried the rifle and fled through a neighborhood of suburban homes,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the 44-year-old Kopp, who is almost 6 feet tall
and has weighed between 155 and 170 pounds, was last sighted Nov.
3, 11 days after the murder, in New Jersey. Although they found one
of Kopp's cars in December in a parking lot at Newark International
Airport, the authorities said they had not been able to locate his
other car, a green 1977 Dodge Aspen bearing Vermont license plate
BFN595.
</P>
<P>
   They listed a patchwork of skills that Kopp possesses _
including carpentry, telephone and lock installation, masonry,
welding and typing _ that he could presumably use to support
himself in his underground life. They also listed three of his
aliases: Clyde Swenson, Jim Cobb and Jack Crotty.
</P>
<P>
   The officials asked anyone with germane information to call
(800) 281-1184 or (716) 856-7800, and noted that a $500,000 award
has been offered in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened urgency of the investigation was dramatized by
the presence at the news conference of Bill Lann Lee, acting
assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
   By charging Kopp with murder and a federal crime of violence,
the authorities said, they hope they can persuade officials in
Washington to include Kopp on the FBI's most-wanted list and assure
the display of his photographs at thousands of post offices and
federal buildings. His name will now carry greater prominence in
national law enforcement data banks.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough that moved the identification of Kopp from a
witness to the sole suspect was the discovery of the rifle. But
officials also said they had been able to tie Kopp to the ambush
site through a fiber that matched ones found in Kopp's 1987
Chevrolet Cavalier and through a hair that they said very closely
matched Kopp's. The Cavalier was also spotted near Slepian's home
10 days before the shooting by a jogger who wrote down the license
plate number, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Should Kopp be captured, the authorities will have to decide in
what order he will be prosecuted. Clark said it made sense for him
to try Kopp first. If Kopp should win an acquittal at the local
level, the federal government, which does not have as strong a
restraint against double jeopardy, could try him again on the
charge of a deadly assault against an abortion provider, he said.
Slepian was the prime gynecologist at Buffalo's only abortion
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell said her agency had not yet discussed the order of
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp is also being sought for questioning in gunfire assaults in
Canada and western New York against four other doctors, none of
whom were killed. Winnipeg Police Service Inspector Keith McCaskill
flew in for Thursday's news conference and said that the attacks
were probably linked but that Canadian police did not have enough
evidence to charge Kopp.
</P>
<P>
   According to family members, Kopp grew up in Marin County,
Calif., the child of a corporate lawyer and a nurse. He attended
the University of California at Santa Cruz near his home and
received a master's degree in biology from California State
University at Fullerton. After his parents' bitter divorce and his
sister's death from leukemia, he spent years in a search for
spiritual meaning, allying himself first with a fundamentalist
Protestant group and later adopting a spartan Roman Catholicism,
said relatives. During one period in his life, he washed his few
items of clothing in a bucket, avoided sexual contact and distanced
himself from his family.
</P>
<P>
   During that period he made contact with the anti-abortion
movement, and starting in the late 1980s, be roamed the country
going from clinic demonstration to another. Eventually he joined
one of the most zealous offshoots of the movement, the Lambs of
Christ.

BU SOCIAL SCIENTIST WOLFE JOINS NEW POLICY CENTER AT BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Alan Wolfe, the prominent social scientist and public
commentator on everything from forgiveness for a philandering
president to suburban malaise, is leaving Boston University to head
the new Center on Religion and American Public Life at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   The center is being billed as the first of its kind in the
nation, bringing together visiting professors, graduate students,
and public intellectuals to consider issues at the intersection of
religion and public policy: vouchers for religious schools, capital
punishment, and even the role of churches in stemming gang
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its time has come,'' Wolfe said Thursday. ``The basic idea is
that there been kind of a vacuum in American life; academics have
ignored the study of religion in the social sciences. At one level,
that contributes to the fact that organizations like the Moral
Majority have filled that vacuum. This is not a center to advocate
faith, but to have the academy think about where religion and
public life come together. I don't have a position myself, I just
want to lead the discussion because it is a discussion that has
been avoided by the academy for the past 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While several universities have institutes or professors
studying the impact of religion on politics, Wolfe said he
envisions BC's center as a place for broader discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Historians might come there to study religious traditions
unfamiliar to them, law professors might debate cloning or
euthanasia, and social scientists could look at data evaluating
whether vouchers improve the academic performance of minority
students.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is leaving a position as a university professor at BU,
which produced some cross-town gloating Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Wolfe's hiring is a coup for Boston College,'' said David
Burgess, the college's dean of faculties.
</P>
<P>
   J. Robert Barth, dean of arts and sciences, said that he was
``absolutely thrilled'' to have Wolfe at BC. ``He has a keen
interest in making sure that serious discussion of religious issues
takes place in academe,'' Barth said. ``He has chosen to come to BC
because he knows that discussion will not be neglected here.''
</P>
<P>
   At BC, Wolfe will be a professor of political science as well as
the head of the center. A 1963 graduate of Temple University with a
doctorate in political science from the University of Pennsylvania,
he began teaching at Rutgers University. His 33-year academic
career has included stints as a professor or visiting scholar at
Harvard, Columbia University, City University of New York, and as a
Fulbright professor at the University of Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is working on his 13th book, ``Moral Freedom,'' to be
published in 2001. Discussions at the center would be based on the
broad blueprint of his most recent book, ``One Nation After All:
What Middle-Class Americans Really Think about God, Country,
Family, Racism, Welfare, Immigration, Homosexuality, Work, the
Right, the Left and Each Other.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing it as a ``middle-class morality project,'' Wolfe
based that book on 200 interviews conducted across the country. His
finding was that Americans share a basic set of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think complexly and yearn for a sense of right and
wrong,'' he wrote. ``But they think that what is right and wrong
for themselves is not necessarily a guide to what is right and
wrong for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe starts at BC on July 1. He said the center would be in the
planning stage during his first year.

FORCE STILL WINNING THROUGH INTIMIDATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the Force _ John Force.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the National Hot Rod Association Funny Car class,
where the eight-time champion has used a mental advantage to
dominate the competition since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the history of John's eight championships, there have
always been cars that are capable (of beating him),'' said teammate
Tony Pedregon, who joined Force's Castrol team in 1996. ``I think
intimidation has had a lot to do with it. I think what people have
a tendency to do when they race John, and now me, is to say, `Wow,
we have to race John now. Load it up.' That's a mistake because for
the most part these cars are on the edge anyway, and unfortunately
they go up and smoke the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend has continued so far this season. Force, who beat his
teammate to win last weekend's Penzoil Nationals near Richmond,
Va., has won four of the first six national events. Pedregon, who
runs the same Ford Mustang as his boss, has won the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Force even joked about the dominance following Monday's
final-round victory over Pedregon that saw him register a
4.940-second pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked what's it going to take to beat me? I tell
them, `That's easy,''' Force said. ```Just hire my crew chiefs
(Austin Coil, Bernie Fedderly and John Medlin).' I don't know much
about these hot rods. Those guys and the team deserve all the
credit. They've worked their (tails) off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their early-season dominance, neither Pedregon or Force
is submitting a championship acceptance speech just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have just been following our way'' the first part of
the season, Pedregon said. ``We've outperformed (the competition)
at a few races, but there have been other events where the guys
have been right there, and maybe they've just made a mistake or
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that lasting two much longer. There are cars out
there that can out-qualify John. Anytime you can do that, you can
race with him. I think they just need to settle down and focus.
Their time is near, they just need to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a bit early. The first few races, we've run on
exceptionally good race tracks. I think that favored us. As we get
into the heat of the summer, it's going to equal and level out the
whole field. The good teams haven't surfaced yet, but it's a matter
of time before they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory McClenathan, who had struggled for consistency during the
first five events, won his first race of the season when he
defeated Larry Dixon in Monday's Top Fuel final.
</P>
<P>
   It moved the driver of the Joe Gibbs-owned dragster to fourth in
points and he became the fourth different winner in Top Fuel this
season. Only points-leader Mike Dunn has won twice.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Capps' struggles continued last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego resident, who appeared to get out of his slump
when he qualified second in Dallas in late April, lost in the first
round last weekend to Whit Bazemore. It was the fifth time in six
national events that Capps had lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Capps, who finished a close second to Force in Funny Car last
season, also failed to qualify at one event.

HELMS, CITING INQUIRY, BARS HEARINGS ON HOLBROOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Neb.)  (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Thursday that it would be ``insane'' to
hold confirmation hearings for Richard C. Holbrooke until the
Justice Department had turned over internal documents about its
ethics investigation of the longtime diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's toughly worded statement was made in response to a
request by two Republicans on the committee that the panel move
quickly to approve Holbrooke's nomination to lead the American
delegation to the United Nations. The nomination has been stalled
for nearly a year by ethics inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, whose panel formally received the nomination in February,
said through his spokesman that ``it would be insane for this
committee to hold a hearing on the Holbrooke nomination while the
Justice Department is withholding documents necessary for us to
review their investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said Helms made essentially the same
argument to President Clinton in a telephone conversation on
Wednesday and warned him that the nomination would not advance
without the Justice Department documents.
</P>
<P>
   There are parliamentary means by which a nomination can be
forced to a vote despite the all-out opposition of a committee
chairman, but this would be very unlikely in the case of Helms.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican senators, Rod Grams of Minnesota and Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, offered their support for Holbrooke's nomination
and called on Helms to hold hearings as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Their request to Helms comes a week after the State Department
inspector- general cleared Holbrooke in the second of two ethics
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The first investigation, conducted by the Justice and State
Departments, ended in February with Holbrooke's agreement to pay
$5,000 to settle civil charges that he violated federal lobbying
laws in his contacts with the American Embassy in South Korea after
he resigned from the State Department in 1996. Holbrooke denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The second investigation, by the State Department's inspector
general, focused on speaking fees that Holbrooke received while
working as an unpaid White House envoy to the Balkans. That inquiry
ended with no finding of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and the committee had requested a variety of internal
documents from the Justice and State Departments over the initial
investigation. Congressional officials said that while the State
Department had turned over some documents, the Justice Department
had so far refused to turn over any.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment on the
request by Helms.

UMASS TO CREATE SIXTH CAMPUS IN WESTBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The University of Massachusetts will announce Friday
that it plans to open a new, sixth campus this fall, the first
expansion of the state's public university since the birth of
UMass-Boston 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a campus on a state-owned 36-acre parcel in Westborough,
the newest UMass branch will offer MBA and other graduate degrees
designed to appeal particularly to employees of the burgeoning
companies in the Route 495 beltway.
</P>
<P>
   That area is the fastest growing part of the state, measured in
both job creation and residential growth. The towns in the
Interstate 495 corridor saw a doubling in the number of
schoolchildren between 1989 and 1996. And while the number of
companies statewide decreased by 2.3 percent, the number in that
region increased by 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have complained that UMass left a hole in that part
of the state, with graduate programs in Boston, Amherst and Lowell
all a long commute away for residents who wanted or needed to
update job skills. Corporations, too, have banded together looking
for ways to make sure the area can provide people with the skills
to fill new jobs, mostly in high technology and health care fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here is in the very best sense a public
purpose, a public mission'' said UMass President William M. Bulger,
who will announce the plan in a lunchtime speech to business
groups. ``The nature of the university is in its land grant origin.
That defined its purpose, which was to educate the citizenry, the
idea that knowledge is infinitely expandable, and should be
available to the largest number of people possible; the recognition
that it's not just abstract ideas, there's a very practical purpose
to it. In the last century, that was agricultural training. Now,
our new purpose is defined by new needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bulger said, the campus can make the difference for
a company considering where to locate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every economist will tell you that the most important asset
for the community when people look to locate a business is the
workforce,'' he said. ``There should be a favorable tax structure,
infrastructure, all that is critical, but nothing matches the whole
matter of workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   The UMass Center for Professional Education will open in
September with 200-300 students, eventually adding more programs
and growing to 3,000 students, putting it above or on par with
graduate schools on the five other campuses. Courses will be
staffed by professors from the other UMass campuses.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the campus will offer a prerequisite program for the
professional MBA program. The degree programs will be added in the
next year. These programs will be 12 course, 36 credit graduate
level programs. Courses will cost $1,500, for a total of $18,000
for a degree. Many companies, Bulger said, will likely pick up the
cost for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   UMass officials worked closely with 495 companies to develop
plans for the new campus. Nine of the 20 Massachusetts companies on
Inc Magazine's list of fastest growing companies are in that
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the 495 corridor continues to grow and thrive, the Center
for Professional Education should be a great resource for Mass
Electric and other local companies who have an ongoing need for
qualified, well-trained employees,'' said Lawrence J. Reilly, the
president of the Massachusetts Electric Company.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Barbara Gardner, the Holliston Democrat,
said she heard demands for nearby professional degree programs from
not only corporate constituents, but from residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are a lot of people in high tech companies that
have not had the opportinity to shift gears because they could not
get the technical training or the advanced degrees they would
reqiure,'' she said. ``I can see a huge, huge population that will
want to take advantage of these programs. They're all fast-growing
communities, a lot of people are young professionals, and they've
obviously had good educations, but they're also on a fast track.
Now they'll be able to complete their education without going to
Amherst or Boston. It's higher salaries, it's more income for the
state, there's just nothing negative about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities in that area, Gardner said, are also struggling with
problems produced by growth, such as traffic congestion and school
construction. The new UMass campus, she said, will serve as a sort
of think tank where local officials can share ideas on how to deal
with common problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new campus is about three miles from the Route 495-Route 9
interchange, on the grounds of the former Lyman School, which was
once the state's first reform school.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, the historic buildings on the land have been
operated by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, a
consortium of public and private colleges and companies led by a
23-member board that is appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The university will lease buildings on the land for $40,000 a
year. Without the demands of an undergraduate campus _ dorms, in
particular, the program will ultimately end up making money for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea of education as something beyond training,''
Bulger said. ``But the land grant people recognized this other
need. I think it's the very thing we're here for, to provide this
practical kind of help.''

HONDA ANNOUNCES PLANS TO BUILD $400 MILLION FACTORY IN ALABAMA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Ohio, Ky., Tenn., Mich. and Ind.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In the latest sign that foreign auto manufacturers are
shifting toward bigger vehicles and moving south in the United
States, Honda announced Thursday that it would build a factory in
rural Alabama to assemble large sport utility vehicles and Odessey
mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor Company Ltd. said that it would spend $400 million
to erect the factory in Lincoln, 40 miles east of Birmingham. The
Mercedes division of DaimlerChrysler AG makes its M-class sport
utility vehicles in Tuscaloosa, Ala., which is 50 miles southwest
of Birmingham, while Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is preparing to
produce BMW X5 sport utility vehicles in Spartanburg, S.C., for
sale beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly going to be sport utility alley down there,''
said Michael E. Robinet, the director of forecast services at CSM
Worldwide Inc., which is based in Northville, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Honda executives and Alabama officials said that the state had
agreed to provide incentives valued at $158.4 million, including
$102.7 million worth of roads, utilities and land for the site; the
rest of the money would be in tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Southern states have been very successful in luring automakers,
partly because their anti-union laws and traditions make it hard
for the United Automobile Workers union to organize workers and
partly because the states offer particularly generous incentives.
Honda executives were defensive about the incentives, saying that
they were taking Alabama's standard offer for new businesses
entering the state, and had not demanded a special arrangement.
Still, state officials went out of their way Thursday to present
Alabama as being open to outsiders, with Gov. Don Siegelman using
several Japanese phrases to welcome Honda during a press conference
in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Koichi Amemiya, chief operating officer for the Americas at
Tokyo-based Honda, said that the factory would start production in
early 2002 and reach full production a year later, when it is
expected to employ 1,500 people. The factory will be capable then
of producing 120,000 vehicles and 120,000 engines a year; the
engines and vehicles will be produced in a single, large building
instead of two separate factories, marking a change from
traditional auto assembly techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas G. Elliott, Honda's executive vice president for U.S.
operations, said that the new factory was needed because of strong
demand for so-called light trucks, a lightly regulated class of
vehicles that includes pickup trucks as well as sport utility
vehicles and mini-vans. While Honda refused to identify the sport
utility vehicle, it is expected to replace the Honda Passport,
which will be somewhat larger.
</P>
<P>
   The same brisk demand has prompted General Motors Corp. to
announce plans to expand its factory in Arlington, Texas, and
consider converting a car factory in Oklahoma City to light-truck
production. Toyota Motor Corp. has just built a pickup truck
factory in Princeton, Ind., where it also plans to start making
full-sized sport utility vehicles soon. DaimlerChrysler AG plans to
replace an aging Jeep factory in Toledo, Ohio, with a larger modern
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Japanese automakers have put most of their operations
in southern Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, staying close to
Interstate 75, which runs to Detroit and provides ready access for
auto parts companies. But suppliers have also been moving to the
south to reduce labor and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Lincoln is named for Gen. Benjamin Lincoln, a
Revolutionary War hero, not for President Abraham Lincoln, who
served during the Civil War.

RADICAL SURGERY WILL TEST COURAGE OF 5-YEAR-OLD CANCER PATIENT

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Five-year-old Nicole Andrewson has been brave
through months of chemotherapy and radiation to fight a deadly
cancer gnawing at her left thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she begins a still-greater test of her courage.
</P>
<P>
   About noon, surgeons at the University of Kansas Medical Center

</P>
<P>
   They will amputate her leg at the hip, remove the diseased

foot faces back, and then use three or four screws to reattach the
thighbone to her hip.
</P>

   When the surgery is complete, her knee will serve as a new hip
joint. Her ankle will serve as her knee. And a prosthetic lower leg
will be fashioned that will attach to her foot.
</P>
<P>
   The operation could last until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole is a spindly little girl. Her blond hair has just started
growing back after cancer therapy took it away. Hints of mischief
and anxiety pass quickly over her face. What remains is a look of
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a stubborn streak in her,'' her mother, Kimberly,
said Thursday as Nicole waited for final blood tests at KU Medical
Center. ``She's bound and determined she's going to get over
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole knows exactly what she faces.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been frank, telling Nicole about her condition,
said her grandmother, Nancy Bye. Nicole has taken it in stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed. She can handle emotions adults can't handle
sometimes,'' Bye said.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicole's mother asked her on Thursday where on her body
doctors would operate, Nicole rubbed her left thigh with her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to go underneath?'' her mother asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fake leg,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole was diagnosed a year ago with Ewing's sarcoma. It's an
aggressive bone cancer that usually strikes young people.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole had been complaining for some time about knee and leg
pains, but doctors thought initially it was just the result of
growth spurts.
</P>
<P>
   That was until the day last May, when her leg swelled and she
wouldn't stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got into a chair and she just lay there in pain,'' her
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole's doctor referred her to specialists who discovered the
cancer. Then came radiation and rounds of chemotherapy that lasted
almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days she was scared, getting blood pulled from her
and medication put down her,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, she has clung to her big pink stuffed
elephant called a Puffalump. The tattered animal is going into
surgery with her today.
</P>
<P>
   For a child in Nicole's situation, there are no easy
alternatives, said Kim Templeton, her surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   More radiation might not eradicate the cancer, and may itself
induce cancer later on. A full amputation of Nicole's leg would
eliminate the cancer, but would make rehabilitation difficult.
</P>
<P>
   So Templeton is performing a procedure called a rotationplasty.
It's so rare she has done it only one other time, while in surgical
training. The surgeon she was assisting on that operation had never
done the procedure before.
</P>
<P>
   It will take six to eight weeks for Nicole's leg to heal where
it will be reattached to her hip. At that point, she'll receive a
prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton said Nicole should eventually be able to play football
and wrestle, her two ambitions after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a fairly indestructible reconstruction. The leg
itself should be able to tackle pretty much anything,'' Templeton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicole will need physical therapy to learn how to use her
ankle as a knee joint. To straighten out her leg, she will have to
point her foot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing in a young kid like this how quickly they catch
on,'' Templeton said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologically, however, the healing may take longer. So far,
the one subject certain to upset Nicole is how her foot appears
after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still worried?'' her mother asked her. ``Are you still
worried about your foot?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton thinks Nicole will grow to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's different, but that's OK,'' the surgeon said.
``You've got to understand, the long-term goal is to keep her
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   And that will take all Nicole's courage.

GONZALES FAMILY RECALL JOY OF SEEING SON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDSTUHL, Germany _ The anxious nights were over, their son was
free and standing before them after a month in Serb hands, but
emotion had robbed Rosie and Gilbert Gonzales of the right words.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out they were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hugging him,'' Rosie Gonzales said Thursday at
Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, recalling her Monday reunion
with her son, U.S. Army Spec. Steven Gonzales of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked in the room. I saw him. I couldn't believe it.''
she said. ``I just wanted to grab a hold of him and not let go. And
tell him I love him. I didn't want to let him let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 22, Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich., and Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles were
brought to the hospital and joyous reunions with their families
after Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic released them at the
urging of U.S. political activist Jesse Jackson. They had been
captured March 31 along the Macedonia-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzaleses, along with Gilbert's sister, Rosie Barrow, left
Texas on Sunday for the reunion. Gilbert brought his son a souvenir
from home _ a Texas A&AMP;M University T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see that he had gone through the whole thing and that
they brought him home in one piece,'' Barrow said. ``We are just so
grateful and thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   After three days of visits scheduled between their son's medical
checkups, psychological evaluations and military investigations,
the family traveled to Wurzburg, where the three soldiers were
decorated.
</P>
<P>
   They then went to nearby Schweinfurt where Gonzales was one of
the lowest-ranking members of the First Squadron, 4th U.S. Cavalry
ever to be inducted into the ``Order of the Spur.''
</P>
<P>
   The honor of wearing spurs is usually reserved for sergeants and
higher-ranking officers who earn the right after mastering cavalry
skills. Stone and Ramirez, who already wear the spurs, put one on
each of Gonzales' boots during a welcome home ceremony at the base
in Schweinfurt, where the three are stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a state of shock, receiving my spurs,'' Gonzales told
the hundreds of soldiers and their families who waved U.S. flags
and yellow ribbons. ``It's a great gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Thursday the three soldiers had been beaten
with rifle butts, kicked and punched as they were captured and that
initial interrogation sessions had been harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said in Washington the Army has
concluded ``beyond a shadow of a doubt'' that the three soldiers
were on the Macedonian side of the border when they were captured,
not on the Yugoslav side as Yugoslav authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taken by a substantially larger force,'' Bacon said.
``I don't know how much larger, but they felt that they didn't have
any alternative but to stop. And, in fact, as they tried to get
out, they ran into an obstacle, which I believe was a ditch, which
also made it difficult for them to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found a stitched-up wound on the top of Ramirez's head
and two fractured ribs. Stone was found to have a broken nose.
Doctors said Gonzales ``turned out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Each soldier spoke briefly at the welcome party Thursday,
thanking Jesse Jackson and the group of clergy who negotiated their
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank the Lord, our God,'' Gonzales said. ``For he
was truly my fortress and my refuge during our captivity.''
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Gonzales said, he held on to the belief that his unit
heard their radio distress call when the three were captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the faith that they were doing all they could and that
we would soon be home,'' he said. ``It's great to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony the soldiers were scheduled to return to
Landstuhl where they will be given leave Friday. Gonzales was to go
home to Texas with his parents for a 30-day leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take him home with us,'' Rosie Gonzales said.
``Family is very important to him. He wants to go spend some time
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   After his leave, she said, he will return to his unit in
Schweinfurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing really, really well,'' she said. ``He's upbeat.
He's full of life, and he's ready to go out there and tackle it.
He's looking forward to going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through many emotions over the last month,'' she
said. ``It was difficult. You always worry about your children but
you never can imagine that something that horrible could happen. It
was a real rough time, but we made it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned 22 during captivity. He can never forget that. But
he had so much love and support from a wonderful family, from his
friends, that I think he is going to be OK.''
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS WON'T START COLD THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Skirmish. It's an excellent word, as used by Jeff Van
Gundy Thursday in a sentence that began, ``If a skirmish comes
about, and inevitably it will. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the Fightin' Knicks would naturally know all about
skirmishes going into yet another playoff series with the Fightin'
Heat of Pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and the Heat put up their dukes starting at 12:30
p.m. Saturday in Miami. Don't hold hot coffee or cold soda in your
lap if you're seated in the first few rows.
</P>
<P>
   According to my Funk &AMP; Wagnalls _ hey, you think Walt Frazier's
got the only dictionary? _ the word ``skirmish'' has roots in old
French and old High German, and refers to the act of fencing or
preliminary fighting between small parties: ``Any encounter or
action that evades the main contention or business.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds about right with these two teams. They have
skirmishes from time to time when Coach Riley's lads wield their
elbows and the Knicks do the same. The trick is to avoid letting
the skirmishes take you out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy thinks the Knicks got themselves in trouble in last
year's playoff series with Miami by being too gentlemanly, too
polite, too kind. He suggests that he and the Knicks had dweled too
much on the 1997 playoff series, when P.J. Brown and Charlie Ward
started scuffling, and most of the Knicks' bench went galloping off
to investigate, despite the pleas of wise old heads Buck Williams
and Herb Williams. The Charge of the Light-Headed Brigade cost the
Knicks the services of most of their starters in either the sixth
or seventh games, both of which they lost. The memory of looking
like blockheads, coupled with reminders from the league, the team,
the news media and the fans caused the Knicks to come out as if
anesthetized last year, when they lost to Miami, 93-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we did a poor job,'' Van Gundy said Thursday,
including himself first in his criticism, as he always does. ``They
played with great intensity, and we played with great poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Both traits are preferable, but Van Gundy would prefer intensity
to poise, and so would his former employer.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing about last year's series was that the Knicks
responded by winning the second game and then the fourth game, in
which Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson had themselves a downright
ugly fistfight between two lugs who do not like each other.
</P>
<P>
   That skirmish is now famous for the sight of Van Gundy's hanging
on to Mourning's leg like a terrier trying to subdue a Clydesdale.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were suspended for the fifth game, which only
proved that Mourning was far more valuable than Johnson, then and
now. The Knicks won, 98-81, but Van Gundy does not want to take any
chances with a placid opener on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season we were almost complacent,'' Van Gundy told the
press Thursday, knowing the message had time to be passed along to
his players. ``They handed our heads to us,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Van Gundy hastened to add: ``I don't think they will be
thinking about fighting. That's a fascination coming from the
outside.'' Still, he can understand why people are a bit
preoccupied by the potential for skirmishes _ ``since it happened
two years in a row,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows there is a history here. He was seen-but-not-heard
assistant to Riley in New York, a loyalist, a friend. He doesn't
even want to hear questions about the last time he spoke with
Riley, etc., etc. It's an old story. Nor does Van Gundy want to be
identified with Riley's code for success, often explained between
hard covers or lucrative motivational speaking gigs. One trademark
of Riley players is never, ever helping opponents off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a rule, but I don't know why you'd want to,'' Van
Gundy said Thursday, referring to offering a helping hand. ``You
fouled him. You didn't commit a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not surprised that Riley is trying to work up indignation
that the Knicks allegedly feel they have an advantage in a short
series with the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   `That's their mantra,'' he said. ``We want them? Nobody would be
foolish enough to want a No. 1 seed. It's almost as if they're
underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``I want us to defend with the desperation of
underdogs and play with the poise of favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy is much too professional to ever think the Knicks
could or should save his job with a passionate last stand. He knows
there will be a skirmish here and there, but he doesn't want one to
take them out of the series.

EDITORIAL: ELEMENTS OF A PEACE DEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 7:
</P>
<P>
   Much diplomatic work remains, but the framework for a reasonable
political settlement in Kosovo may be falling into place, thanks in
part to Russia's constructive role as a peacemaker. A critical move
came Thursday, when Moscow parted company with Serbia and formally
endorsed the use of an international security force in Kosovo after
the war ends. In joining the United States and its allies in
support of this and other core principles for a peace deal, Russia
has left Slobodan Milosevic increasingly isolated in his fight with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action can tip the Balkan war toward resolution, but
only if Milosevic is ready to accept some of the terms that he
rejected two months ago, before the NATO air war began. President
Clinton, for his part, will have to insure that the details of any
accord hold fast to the principles he and other NATO leaders have
enunciated. Milosevic will doubtless be looking for every advantage
he can find if negotiations begin in earnest, and sound guidelines
will mean little if the actual terms of a settlement are vague or
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia now agree that an effective
international security force must be positioned in Kosovo once the
war ends to prevent further ethnic conflict and to assure the safe
return of more than a million displaced ethnic Albanians. That is a
pivotal agreement, and marks a significant shift in Moscow's
position. But the composition, command and precise role of such a
force was not addressed in the joint statement issued Thursday in
Bonn by the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, the force must include NATO and Russian
soldiers and be adequately armed. It will need robust rules of
engagement and commanders willing to use them to prevent future
Serbian attacks and to discourage ethnic Albanian guerrilla
fighters from assaulting Serbian targets in Kosovo. The mandate for
the force should come from the United Nations Security Council, as
the Bonn statement suggested. That would help overcome Serbian and
Russian concerns about placing foreign troops on Yugoslav soil.
</P>
<P>
   The other principles that Russia endorsed Thursday echo ideas
that Moscow had previously approved, but they remain important to
any settlement. They include the withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo, the need for temporary international administration of the
province once the war ends and the eventual restoration of
substantial self-government in Kosovo. It will not be easy to
develop a detailed agreement with Serbia on any of these issues,
especially if Russia fails to press Milosevic to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   There is not yet sufficient reason to suspend the bombing, and
there will not be until Milosevic calls off his murderous assault
on Kosovo, starts withdrawing his troops and commits himself to the
Bonn principles. Only then can serious negotiations commence. But
for now, at least, it is a hopeful sign that Russia has
reconsidered its reflexive support for Milosevic and seems
determined not to let the war in Kosovo shatter its ties with the
West.

EDITORIAL: CLEANING UP THE BIG CARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 7:
</P>
<P>
   The news from Detroit was heartening this week _ robust
automobile sales, driven mainly by purchases of sport utility
vehicles, minivans and a lot of those fancy pickup trucks that are
beginning to look as comfortable as luxury cars. The news from
Washington was equally heartening _ a set of tough new federal
regulations that, for the first time, will subject those very same
vehicles to the strict pollution standards that apply to ordinary
cars. For good measure, the Clinton administration also announced
new regulations that will force the oil companies to produce
cleaner fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are designed to address two broad trends that
threaten to reverse decades of steady improvement in air quality.
One is that Americans are driving more miles every year _ from 1
trillion miles in 1970 to 2.5 trillion miles in 1997. The other is
that standard cars are being replaced by so-called light trucks, a
category that includes the popular SUVs, minivans and pickups that
have done so much to bring the good times back to Detroit. Light
trucks now account for half the vehicles sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, vehicles in this category have been allowed to
produce up to three times as much pollution per mile as standard
cars. Under the new rules, which will be phased in starting with
the 2004 model year, both standard cars and light trucks will have
to meet the same fleetwide average pollution level of 0.07 grams
per mile of nitrogen oxides, which are the main contributor to smog
and a significant factor in acid rain. The rules would cut
allowable pollution from standard cars by more than two-thirds, and
from some of the bigger SUVs by up to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rule requiring cleaner gasoline will make it easier for the
car manufacturers to meet their new targets. Refineries will be
required to cut the nationwide average of sulfur in gasoline by
about 90 percent, beginning in 2004. This is vital because sulfur
clogs up a vehicle's catalytic converter, the device that cleans
car exhaust of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will pay more under these new rules, although it is
not clear how much. The emissions standards could add several
hundred dollars to the cost of vehicles in the light truck
category, and the sulfur rules could added several cents to the
price of a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile companies seem to have accepted the plan. That
leaves the administration with one implacable enemy instead of two
_ the oil industry, which has denounced the sulfur requirements as
too tough and too expensive. But ever since the original Clean Air
Act of 1970, industry has routinely overestimated the costs of new
rules, while underestimating the ability of its own engineers to
deliver cleaner products at an affordable price. If history is any
guide, that will happen again.

EDITORIAL: THE TEST FOR GOVERNOR WHITMAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 7:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey is facing a leadership test
that will provide a measure of her fitness for higher office. For
years she ignored or minimized complaints that state troopers were
engaging in racial profiling, the practice of stopping motorists
based on their skin color. Now, even as racial profiling is
belatedly being curbed, she is pushing hard to get her attorney
general, Peter Verniero, a seat on the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero not only had oversight responsibility for the police
agency that engaged in the profiling, he has been judged
unqualified for the court by the state bar association. By trying
to muscle this nomination through the state Senate, Whitman has
shown herself more concerned with rewarding a flawed political ally
than with making a high-quality judicial appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Latino legislators in New Jersey strongly oppose
Verniero's nomination because he failed to investigate
discrimination complaints in a timely manner. Only recently has he
issued a report acknowledging that racial profiling by troopers
exists, and the state is now entering into settlement talks with
the U.S. Department of Justice to end the practice. Verniero's
promotion would be a slap to minority communities that believe he
should have attacked the problem years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman seems, however, to care little about anger in those
communities or about the opinions of the legal community. The state
bar association's judicial and prosecutorial appointments committee
has found that Verniero is not qualified for the Supreme Court
because he lacks legal experience. Verniero has tried no cases
before juries, has no judicial experience and lacks a substantial
record of legal accomplishment. His claim to fame is his utter
loyalty to Whitman and his service as a chief political aide in the
Whitman administration for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Republican-controlled state Senate, support for
Verniero is soft. If he wins Senate confirmation next Monday, it
will probably be by only one or two votes. The Republicans may end
up placing him on the court to avoid either undermining Whitman
before her Senate race or incurring her wrath for the next two
years. Unfortunately, New Jersey residents may have to live with
Verniero on the court for the next 30 years, long after Whitman and
her allies have passed from the scene.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE HANDLING OF SPY CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that the
Justice Department would examine whether federal authorities had
mishandled the investigation of a nuclear scientist suspected of
spying for China.
</P>
<P>
   Reno announced the internal inquiry one day after Republican
senators accused the Justice Department and the FBI of repeated
lapses in a national security investigation of the scientist, Wen
Ho Lee, over nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to review everything we've done to see if there is
anything that could have been done differently,'' Reno said
Thursday at her weekly briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's willingness to re-examine the case was an indication that
the China espionage inquiry is emerging as a potentially
embarrassing issue for the department as criticism from Congress
intensifies. The review was first reported Thursday by The
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on Wednesday, lawmakers expressed outrage over the
many aspects of the case, but their complaints seemed to focus on
the Justice Department's refusal in 1997 to allow FBI agents to
examine Lee's office computer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
have said that the Justice Department's stance on the case kept
them from spot-checking Lee's computer, fearing it might taint a
possible case against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's refusal to allow a search of the
computer kept authorities from knowing, for nearly two years, that
Lee had routinely transferred into an unclassified network millions
of lines of secret computer codes used in the development of
advanced nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   FBI counterintelligence officials sought permission from the
Justice Department to use more aggressive investigative techniques
against Lee in June 1997 through a warrant obtained under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Usually, such applications
seek permission to search or wiretap a suspect's home or office.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department turned down the application because,
as one official put it Thursday, it lacked ``currency,'' meaning
that the evidence against Lee was too dated and insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials appealed the decision to Reno, but the
subordinates who reconsidered the issue rejected the application a
second time later in 1997. Other officials said Thursday that the
FBI did not specifically ask for permission to search Lee's office
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Reno said that the sequence of decision-making that
held back the agents remained unclear. In part, she said, the
review will seek to unravel what happened between officials at two
agencies that frequently tangle over legal standards and strategies
in criminal and espionage cases.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a routine bureaucratic fight may have far-reaching
consequences. When agents finally opened Lee's computer earlier
this year, they discovered that he had transferred files from 1983
through 1995, and officials have said there is evidence that
someone else examined the files once they were in the unclassified
system. Still, there remains no evidence that Lee passed the code
information to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the review would reach back nearly two decades to
examine whether authorities had responded seriously to signs, some
of them blurry, suggesting that employees at the U.S. weapons labs
were engaged in espionage. In part, the effort parallels White
House efforts to spread responsibility for any lapses to previous
Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to 1982,'' Reno said. ``We've got to look at what
was done since that time, what we can learn to make sure we did
everything right, that our predecessors did right. And by right, I
mean that they did or we did it in the best way possible,
consistent with the law, to protect national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was fired in March, has not been charged with any
crime, and his lawyer has denied that he did anything wrong.
Law-enforcement officials said that reconstructing Lee's past
activities to determine whether he engaged in espionage had proven
difficult. Chinese officials have said they did not pilfer American
nuclear secrets, but have not discussed the specifics of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative review will be led by Justice Department
lawyers and FBI agents who were not involved in the original
inquiry.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 7:
</P>
<P>
   The nation owes two principled Democratic senators from North
Dakota its thanks. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan have both announced
that they will oppose the so-called Flag Desecration Amendment
approved by an 11-7 margin in the Senate Judiciary Committee last
week. The amendment, which would allow federal laws banning flag
desecration, is a sad example of patriotism gone awry. It would
undermine the right of free expression in the name of protecting
the flag that symbolizes that freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Following the committee's action, Conrad and Dorgan, whose votes
were considered key, announced that they intended to vote ``no'' on
the amendment, much as they both did on the last Senate go-round in
1995. That leaves the amendment at least two votes shy of the
two-thirds majority required for passage by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been debating the amendment on and off since 1989,
when the Supreme Court, in a controversial ruling upholding the
First Amendment, held that flag-burning was constitutionally
protected free speech. It is time to move on. Having no epidemic of
flag desecration to point to since the court spoke, Judiciary
Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, the amendment's leading Senate
sponsor, ought to drop this destructive effort to weaken the Bill
of Rights.

CIA'S TOP SPY TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jack Downing, a legendary cold-warrior who came out
of retirement two years ago to help revive the CIA's badly depleted
clandestine espionage service, is stepping down as the agency's top
spy, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, 58, the only man in the CIA's history to serve as
station chief in both Moscow and Beijing, said in an interview that
he would retire from his post as director of the agency's
directorate of operations at the end of July. He will be succeeded
by his deputy, James Pavitt, 53, who in addition to a career in
espionage has also been exposed to Washington politics and policy
through a stint at the National Security Council at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, who was coaxed out of retirement in 1997 by the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, is one of the last
of a generation of CIA officers who spent their careers fighting
and winning the Cold War. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who
retired soon after the Soviet Union's collapse, the Aldrich Ames
spy scandal and drastic budget cuts, Downing returned to help pull
the agency out of its post-Cold War identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His return has parallels to the fictional return of George
Smiley, the spy master who, in the novels of John le Carre,
returned to save British intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-year tenure, Downing focused his efforts on
hiring a new generation of case officers to fill the holes left by
the turnover that occurred at the end of the Cold War. Downing also
laid out a five-year plan establishing a strategy for the agency to
handle post-Cold War intelligence challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Downing tried to turn around the depressed morale and
aversion to risk that had taken hold inside the agency by the time
of his return. Bureaucratic imperatives and intense political
oversight had, by the mid-1990s, begun to strangle the willingness
of CIA case officers to risk conducting secret operations.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said that he had ``grave doubts about coming back,'' but
that he has loved his return to the spy world.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said Thursday that Downing's return had been critical to
helping the service recover from the malaise. ``He's a legend who
will never be fully appreciated by the American public because he
did so much in anonymity,'' Tenet said. ``But you can't brand him
just as a cold warrior. He bridged two eras, and brought new
thinking to the problems the agency has today.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his latest tour was not the first time Downing was
asked to pull the CIA out of a crisis. In 1986, he was sent to
Moscow as station chief after the KGB had arrested most of the
CIA's Russian agents. At the time, the CIA did not know that Ames,
a mole inside the agency, was the cause of the losses. Downing
stayed in Moscow until 1989, rebuilding the agency's Soviet
network.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the first time in 1995 after a tour as Beijing
station chief.

LOUIS ROSS, 67, FORD EXECUTIVE WHO OVERSAW TAURUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis R. Ross, a former vice chairman of Ford Motor Co. who
oversaw the introduction in 1985 of the Ford Taurus, which became
one of its most successful cars and helped the company recover from
low profits and quality problems, died May 2 in Naples, Fla. He was
67.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the funeral home nor the company knew the cause, and
family members could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Taurus, which was conceived in 1979 and developed for about
$3 billion, was a huge gamble for Ford because it was to be the
basis for many of Ford's cars into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the car had a troubled introduction, it became a hit
and helped Ford make gains in the large-car segment that had long
been dominated by General Motors. Such cars are more profitable
because they are loaded with options and command higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a low-key but blunt-speaking executive, had to work
through numerous delays in the introduction the Taurus. It hit the
height of its sales campaign in December, considered a bad time to
sell cars when people are focused on holiday spending.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he eventually had the satisfaction of seeing Ford
surpass General Motors in profitability in the late 1980s as car
buyers embraced the sleeker European styling and front-wheel drive
of the Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was born and raised in Detroit. He attended Wayne State
University and received a master's degree in business
administration from Michigan State University. He joined Ford in
1955 and made his way up by showing technical skill and management
ability.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the product planning manager of the Thunderbird in
1963 and then worked in various positions where he was in charge of
quality control.
</P>
<P>
   He was well suited to deal with the upheaval of the auto
industry in the wake of a surge in gasoline prices in the 1970s
after the Arab oil boycott. It helped foreign automakers penetrate
the U.S. market with their smaller and more efficient vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic automakers like Ford had to scramble to design and
produce more fuel-efficient cars and bring in innovations such as
front-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was particularly hard hit, and in the early 1980s, chairman
Henry Ford II took drastic steps. He dismissed president Lee
Iacocca and eventually retired himself, turning over the reins to a
new management team headed by Philip Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   During this turbulent time, Ross was named head of North
American operations in February 1985 and worked on improving
quality. He held the view that Detroit automakers could no longer
turn out poorly assembled cars and have their dealers work out the
bugs because overseas car makers, particularly in Japan, put the
emphasis on getting it right in the factory.
</P>
<P>
   He was named executive vice president and chief technical
officer in 1991 and was promoted to vice chairman in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1996. He served as a trustee of Oakland
University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Janice, of Naples; a brother, James;
a sister, Dorothy, and two sons, Stephen and Philip.

 By JIM HENDERSON  
and BILL SULLIVAN 
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PLANO _ Mark Tuinei, the former Pro Bowl lineman who shared a
record for tenure with the Dallas Cowboys, was found dead shortly
before sunrise Thursday, slumped over the steering wheel of his car
outside his home in this Dallas suburb. He was 39.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's shocking for all of us,'' said defensive line coach Jim
Bates, after a voluntary team workout was canceled when the news of
Tuinei's death reached the Cowboys' Valley Ranch headquarters. ``He
was in the weight room last week. He was in great shape. It's just
a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not immediately known, but Plano Police
Chief Bruce Glasscock said there was no evidence that alcohol,
drugs or foul play was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're treating it like any other unattended death,''
Glasscock.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, investigators were trying to determine how
Tuinei spent the last 24 hours of his life ``in an effort to find
someone who can provide us with any information. We do know Mr.
Tuinei was in Dallas last night.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that Tuinei had gone out with friends
Wednesday night and that they had taken him home and left him in
his car after he passed out.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, police spokesman Carl Duke said
investigators had ``talked to several people'' but had not
confirmed Tuinei's activities Wednesday. Among those the police
interviewed was Cowboys backup fullback Nicky Sualua.
</P>
<P>
   Police had expected a preliminary report from the medical
examiner's office by Thursday afternoon but later were told no
information would be available until next week.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the day, Glasscock said an
unidentified friend received a call early Thursday and was told to
check on Tuinei. When the friend arrived, he found Tuinei in his
car and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics attempted unsuccessfully to revive Tuinei, who was
then taken to Medical Center of Plano. Doctors worked on him for a
half hour, a hospital spokeswoman said, before pronouncing him dead
at 6:54 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He was not known to have had a life-threatening medical
condition, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-5 and 320 pounds, Tuinei was considered one of the toughest
players in the NFL during his 15-year career with the Cowboys, a
career in which he played for three Super Bowl championship teams
and made two Pro Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the Cowboys as a free agent from Hawaii in 1983 and
landed a job as a defensive lineman under coach Tom Landry. He
later was moved to the offensive line and became a starter in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   His work at left tackle has been credited with being a major
factor in making the Cowboys three-time Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of tremendous sadness,'' Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman said, speaking of the mood at team headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei was preparing to return to Hawaii next week to begin a
new job as offensive line coach at Punahou High School, his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never seemed healthier or happier about going home,'' said
his friend, Will Morris, also a graduate of Punahou High. ``He was
as happy as can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's wife, Pono, was already in Hawaii, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of his football career, Tuinei was hampered
by chronic knee problems. During the 1997 season, he played only
seven games because of a sprained left knee and surgery to repair
bone damage to his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   He was released by the Cowboys before the beginning of summer
camp in 1998. His 15-year tenure with the team is a record he
shared with former safety Bill Bates and former defensive end Ed
``Too Tall'' Jones.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, the few players who stayed around after the
workout was called off praised their former teammate as a ferocious
competitor but a gentle friend off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been guys as tough as Mark Tuinei, but you'd be
hard-pressed to find any tougher,'' said Babe Laufenberg, a former
Cowboys quarterback and now a local sportscaster. ``But he was a
gentle guy. I have a 4-year-old who used to love it when Mark would
come over and play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Daryl Johnston said, ``It's like losing an older
brother for me. He taught me a lot. He taught me how to play with
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Said former punter Mike Saxon: ``I can tell you he was one of
the biggest caring guys I've ever met in my life. That's what I'm
going to remember him for.''

<P>
   Q. During a recent office trip to a regional meeting, I had a
run-in with one of the top executives. On the return bus ride, the
executive, having had one too many that evening, took the seat next
to me and proceeded to make advances _ verbal and physical _ for
two hours. Not wanting to cause a scene, I sat quietly, trying to
steer the conversation in a safe direction. (Many of my co-workers
were asleep and probably didn't witness the incident.) The next
day, the executive acted as though nothing had happened. After
several days, I confronted him. He apologized and expressed great
embarrassment. Three weeks later, I'm still enraged, hurt and
uncomfortable at work. What should I do next?
</P>
<P>
   A. For what it's worth, you are far from alone. Such stories are
so depressingly common _ even in the 1990s _ that someone should
write a column aimed at unenlightened corporate executives and call
it ``10 Ways to Convince Women at the Office That You're a Complete
Jerk.'' Its first recommendation would be ``Get tanked and drool
sweet nothings into her ear.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, you were correct to confront the executive, said
Elizabeth Lansberg, a lawyer at Equal Rights Advocates, a women's
group in San Francisco. ``That's always the first step,'' she said.
``We counsel women that, if they feel comfortable enough, they
should talk to the harasser and say clearly that they don't like
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the executive did have the good sense to apologize.
His chagrin, though no excuse for his boorishness, suggests he's
not a total heel _ at least not when he's sober.
</P>
<P>
   So where to go from here? Legal action isn't really an option at
this point, said Martha Davis, legal director at the NOW Legal
Defense and Education Fund in New York. It is rare for courts to
rule that a single incident constitutes sexual harassment. (Most
such cases have involved sexual assault.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for that rule of thumb _ if it's a single incident,
it has to be severe _ is based on the idea that in the workplace
you have to have something of a thick skin,'' Ms. Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to pursue the issue, check your company's internal
grievance procedure. Such procedures have become more common as
companies try to protect themselves against liability in harassment
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Filing a grievance could have therapeutic value, Ms. Davis said,
and could result in a reprimand of the offending executive. But be
aware that your action could make it even more awkward for you to
work with him (although overt retaliation on his part, of course,
would be illegal).
</P>
<P>
   If you sense that he is truly sorry, you may want to let the
issue rest _ for now. Find a sympathetic friend or two to help you
work through the anger. Be cautious, however, about discussing the
matter at work. Once a story enters the rumor mill, it takes on a
life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts also recommend that you write down everything _
from first boozy leer to final apology _ and keep the document
safely at home. Should anything else happen, you'll be in a much
stronger position to teach Lothario a lesson.

BELGRADE AGREES TO ADMIT U.N. MISSION TO ASSESS RELIEF NEEDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Officials said Thursday that Belgrade has
agreed to let a U.N. mission visit Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, to
assess relief needs. The leader of an advance team representing
several agencies left immediately for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, announced that the trip was on after
Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's representative here, delivered a
letter welcoming the mission and assuring that Belgrade would
facilitate the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The advance team is to discuss arrangements for the arrival of
the main mission of about 15 relief groups, which will visit
Kosovo; it is expected to arrive in Yugoslavia by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed that an
emergency mission visit Yugoslavia to assess ``the magnitude of the
problem'' and ``prepare the ground for the refugees to go back to
Kosovo.'' There was immediate skepticism from Russia, Britain and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that Moscow wanted assurances that such a mission
would include not just an assessment of the damage in Kosovo, but
also the damage to Serbs and to Yugoslavia's infrastructure from
allied bombing. At the same time, the United States and Britain
expressed concern that such a mission might suggest that NATO was
willing to halt its air strikes, which, they stressed, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials reacted coolly to the announcement. One
official said that the timing of the proposed mission was not
``ideal'' from NATO's standpoint. Another Western envoy said he was
concerned that President Slobodan Milosevic would try to manipulate
the mission for propaganda purposes.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that Annan had written a letter Thursday to
Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, informing him of the
mission and presumably seeking assurances that NATO's fighter
planes would avoid targeting the mission's convoy as it traveled
through Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan told reporters that he had not asked for a pause in
the bombing and suggested that he was prepared to proceed without
explicit, public assurances from NATO.

 &HT;    On Day of Prayer, a lesson in allegiance to God and man
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thousands of Central Texans joined more than 2
million Americans on Thursday who observed National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nation, large crowds gathered at noon outside
city buildings and inside churches to pray for the nation's
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the day kicked off with a 6:45 a.m. breakfast where
more than 1,000 people showed up to pray and hear the Rev. E.V.
Hill, pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Los Angeles. Hill, a
nationally recognized religious leader, grew up in Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, filling in for Gov. George W. Bush, drew
laughter when he asked the crowd ``to pray for us the next 26 days
that peace breaks out in the Texas House and Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill began his message by saying being back in Austin was
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is the place where people are kind,'' he said. It's
also where he first fell in love, only to be dumped. ``I come to
Austin with mixed emotions,'' he said with a broad smile. ``I come
partly to want to pray and partly to want to cuss.''
</P>
<P>
   After the laughter died down, Hill launched into a serious
message about how prayer must be done properly and is a powerful
force that works. Unfortunately, he told the crowd ``prayer in
America . . . has been reduced to a program item.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's politically correct environment sometimes drives God and
Jesus Christ out of prayers in the public arena, which creates a
secular program item rather than a spiritual engagement, Hill said.
His goal, he said, is to make prayer spiritual ``to the only one
that can answer prayer, and that is God through Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age in which diversity is celebrated, such controversial
statements are classic Hill, who makes no bones about where he
stands on an issue. Recently, Hill has been under fire for his
allegiance to the Rev. Henry Lyons, who resigned in March as
president of the National Baptist Convention USA after being
convicted of stealing more than $4 million from the nation's
largest and most influential black denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is running for Lyons' post, said he is not one to
abandon a friend in hard times. ``That doesn't mean you necessarily
condone everything the friend does,'' he said in an interview.
``Whatever smut that might have gotten on me _ that's small
compared to what Jesus took on from us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the prayer breakfast, Hill said he never would be where he is
now without the power of prayer. His mother prayed for him to
graduate from high school at a time when blacks were expected to
drop out after 10th grade to work. He made it through high school.
</P>
<P>
   His mother bought him a bus ticket to Prairie View A&AMP;M
University, about 45 miles northwest of Houston. ``My momma said
just before the bus took off, `Be a good boy and I'm praying for
you,''' he said. As he stood in the school's registration line with
$1.83 in his pocket, he feared getting to the front of the line,
where a sign announced that students must pay $83 in cash or
cashier's check to enroll. A school official told him to get out of
line. Hill had been awarded a four-year scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that prayer works,'' Hill said.

   NEW YORK _ With a $5 billion investment in AT&AMP;T Corp., Microsoft
Corp. on Thursday secured an inside track in supplying software for
the high-speed communications networks of the future. But it has by
no means assured that it will be the dominant supplier, as it is
today in the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a small stake in AT&AMP;T Corp., Microsoft's
investment bought it a pledge that a version of its Windows
operating system will power as many as 10 million next-generation
set-top boxes in AT&AMP;T's growing network of television cable
systems. That would be twice as many boxes as were originally
supposed to run Windows.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft did not get, though, may eventually prove more
important. Taking a lesson from 1981, when IBM unwittingly set
Microsoft on a course to dominate the computer industry by making
it the exclusive supplier of the operating system for the IBM PC,
AT&AMP;T confined Microsoft to a larger chunk of what will remain a
highly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's negotiations with Microsoft, according to people involved
in the deal, were guided by two objectives: Get the money, but
prevent the software giant from repeating its dominance of the PC
business in the industry now being assembled around ultra-fast data
networks known as broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Microsoft got was the opportunity to get on the inside
with us as we develop the technology for broadband,'' said John
Petrillo, executive vice president for corporate strategy at AT&AMP;T.
``What Microsoft did not get is an exclusive deal. It is not going
to be the only company supplying us software for set-top boxes or
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement of the AT&AMP;T-Microsoft pact produced new
details of a deal whose broad outlines had been previously
reported. The companies have agreed to deliver digital services _
from interactive television to Internet shopping _ to homes in
three cities next year. The local markets for the ``model cities
program'' were not named, but Denver would be a likely choice for
one pilot effort, according to one person close to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Under a previous accord, AT&AMP;T had agreed to use Windows CE
software in 5 million set-top boxes. AT&AMP;T said on Thursday that it
would increase that commitment by another 2.5 million to 5 million
set-top devices.
</P>
<P>
   The 7.5 million to 10 million set-top boxes running Windows
software represents 30 percent to 40 percent of the 25 million
households to be served eventually by AT&AMP;T's cable networks _ after
AT&AMP;T completes its acquisition of Mediaone Group and, as part of
that deal, the swap of some cable operations with the Comcast Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Microsoft executives emphasized that the main purpose
of the deal was to accelerate the deployment of high-speed services
over cable networks. The goal is to upgrade the high-capacity pipes
of the cable networks to deliver digital television, telephone
service and high-speed Internet access to millions of homes.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&AMP;T, said that the pact
was proof Microsoft ``shares our strategy of using broadband cable
to bring a new generation of digital communications, information
and entertainment services to millions of American families.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will use Microsoft's $5 billion to help pay to upgrade the
cable networks, enabling them to handle two-way communications
needed for telephony, Internet messaging and interactive TV.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is paying for a favored place in the next generation
of high-speed Internet-based computing. Some analysts have called
this future the post-PC era because they think the personal
computer may not play the central role that it does today. Internet
appliances of the future will likely include set-top boxes,
handheld devices, digital wallets, cell phones and many others.
That diversity represents a huge challenge to Microsoft, the
technology standard-setter of the PC era.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 billion, to be sure, represents only a slice of
Microsoft's cash hoard of $22 billion. ``This deal is not all that
important financially, but it is of great strategic significance
for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, a Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
analyst. ``Broadband is a fat digital pipe to the home, and
Microsoft desperately wants to be at end of that pipe.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Armstrong said that Microsoft could be a major
supplier to the broadband industry but it would not control the
essential software technology as it does in the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The architecture of Windows is owned by Microsoft,'' he said.
``Microsoft can dictate the technology specifications and
programming interfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the broadband industry, Armstrong asserted, is a ``very
different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, fearing that Microsoft could control the cable industry
if it came to dominate set-top box software, the leading cable
companies at the time said that Cable Labs, the industry's research
consortium, would set the technology standards for digital set-top
boxes. The industry's objective was to not become overly dependent
on a single software supplier.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T executives reiterated that commitment on Thursday. ``We
invite and solicit other vendors,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   And Petrillo, the AT&AMP;T strategist, said that one reason his
company selected Microsoft as the set-top box supplier for the
three test cities was that at this early stage Microsoft had the
most complete product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets us to market faster,'' Petrillo said. ``And we see
Microsoft kind of as the rabbit in this game. Our judgment is that
other software companies will respond to Microsoft and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony Corp., with its Aperos operating system, is among the other
leading suppliers of set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java, an Internet programming language,
is a software layer that runs on top of set-top operating systems,
allowing software developers to write programs independent of the
operating system underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that anything that drives the broader deployment of
broadband is good for us, as long as Microsoft cannot move to
undermine Java's role as an independent programming environment,''
said Alan Barantz, president of Java Software, a unit of Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by securing a larger role for Windows CE, Microsoft helps
assure that its software will mesh not only with set-top boxes but
also with many other Internet devices for which it is also
developing software. That extra measure of compatibility, some
analysts say, could give Microsoft a competitive edge in the
post-PC era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not what Microsoft earns, or not, from set-top box
software but the spillover to all the other Internet devices in the
home,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business
School. ``This is a very smart move for Microsoft, and it is still
uncertain how it will play out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Yoffie noted, no one in the industry thought
that Microsoft's basic DOS operating system was an issue. ``People
did not appreciate the software hooks Microsoft could put into DOS
to make it so hard for users to switch, insuring a technology
lock-in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's investment in AT&AMP;T is complex financially. Microsoft
will purchase interest-bearing securities that are convertible to
AT&AMP;T shares during the next three years at a price of $75 a share.
That is well above AT&AMP;T's current share price, which closed up $5
on Thursday, to $61.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the deal, Microsoft will purchase a 29.9 percent
stake in Telewest Communications PLC, a British cable TV company.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when many high-technology shares dropped sharply,
Microsoft closed down $1.1875 on Thursday at $77.9375.

   The States Lighten Up
</P>
<P>
   The states cut taxes last year by a record $5.3 billion, for a
total of $22 billion in cuts since 1995. Still, that does not
reverse the $31 billion in increases the states imposed from 1991
to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine states cut taxes and nine enacted net increases in
1998, said Donald J. Boyd, executive director of the Center for the
Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in
Albany. It was the fourth consecutive year that the states, over
all, took in more taxes than they had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said governors and legislatures ``have this wondrous
situation where taxes are growing faster than they can cut them.''
The biggest 1998 cut was in New York, at almost $2 billion.

MACEDONIAN TROOPS SAID TO PUSH 1,000 REFUGEES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Officials from the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees accused Macedonian soldiers Thursday of
pushing as many as 1,000 ethnic Albanian refugees back into Kosovo
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And Macedonian border guards effectively sealed the border
Thursday, allowing no refugees to cross into Macedonia only two
days after 5,000 ethnic Albanians fled here from Kosovo, the
refugee officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian government officials denied Thursday afternoon that
the border was closed or that soldiers pushed refugees back into
Kosovo. But in a morning news conference, Defense Minister Nikola
Kljusev had hinted that his government might decide to allow into
Macedonia each day only as many refugees as are flown or bused out
of the country by aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers called the border closing and the defense minister's
comment the latest examples of the Macedonian government's using
the lives of Kosovar refugees to effectively blackmail aid agencies
and Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   While the influx of over 200,000 refugees is putting the small
country under tremendous social, political and economic pressure,
they said, the government's tactics are inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sympathetic to their position,'' said one aid worker
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But nevertheless you don't
close the border to people who have been terrorized and send them
back into the arms of the people who have been carrying out these
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests aside, the tactic is working. As the overcrowding in
refugee camps worsens, in part because of Macedonia's refusal to
expand them, Western nations are stepping up slow-moving efforts to
evacuate refugees. And Macedonian and Albanian government officials
are completing an agreement that will allow an initial group of
6,000 refugees to be transported from Macedonia to Albania by bus.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuations, particularly the shifting of refugees to
Albania, is a victory for the Macedonian government. Albania, a far
poorer country, has already accepted twice as many refugees as
Macedonia. But aid officials said American, British and other
Western diplomats are so fearful of upsetting Macedonia's fragile
ethnic balance that they are acquiescing to the Macedonian tactics.
</P>
<P>
   What diplomats fear is an explosion of ethnic tensions in
Macedonia, where ethnic Macedonians make up two-thirds of the
population and ethnic Albanians make up most of the rest. Ethnic
Macedonians fear they could be outnumbered by ethnic Albanians if
refugees from Kosovo are allowed to continue to flood over the
border and resettle here as refugees have in past Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's fragile coalition government, consisting of the
country's two main ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian parties,
could collapse, and fighting in Macedonia could draw Albania and
Greece into a wider Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian government officials have said the refugees, who now
represent nearly 10 percent of the country's population of 2
million, are creating enormous economic and social costs. With
commerce with Yugoslavia, its main trading partner, nonexistent,
Macedonia's economy is suffering, government officials complain,
and Western nations have been slow to deliver aid. On Wednesday,
industrialized nations and aid groups promised Macedonia at least
$250 million in assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Macedonian soldiers herded the refugees back into Kosovo
on Wednesday night is not clear, according to officials from the
office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Redmond, an agency spokesman, said refugee officials saw a
group of soldiers arrive at the border on Wednesday at roughly 5:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Standing shoulder to shoulder, they advanced in a long line
toward roughly 1,000 refugees waiting in a no man's land between
the Yugoslav and Macedonian border posts. Moving slowly, they
pushed the bewildered refugees back toward the Yugoslav border
post.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the group was herded around a corner where they
could not be seen, Redmond said. On Thursday morning, a single
family that managed to cross reported that 2,000 to 4,000 were
waiting to cross just out of sight of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee officials on Thursday met with various Macedonian
government ministers, all of whom denied that the border was
closed. By Thursday night, the refugee agency said it had received
assurances that the border would remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ministry of Interior said they regret this incident and
the border is open,'' Redmond said Thursday night. ``We'll see if
it is.''

   For many years, a certain newspaper would run a headline over
its weekly patents column proclaiming ``Wide Variety of Ideas
Covered by Patents Issued During Week.'' Now it is the advertising
column that is all about a wide variety, in this instance
advertisers in fields as diverse as computers, banks, baking mixes
and appliances, which are all making account changes.
</P>
<P>
   The combined billings that were shifted Thursday were estimated
at $130 million to $155 million. The bulk of that, $70 million to
$90 million, involved Dell Computer Corp., which named Ammirati
Puris Lintas in New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos.,
to handle assignments for its home and small-business group
products in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The decision puts Ammirati Puris back in the competitive
computer category in a big way. Last year, it lost the account of
Compaq Computer Corp., with billings estimated at $200 million, to
DDB Worldwide Communications Group in New York, a unit of Omnicom
Group; the Compaq loss was one in a series of difficulties suffered
by Ammirati Puris that included turbulence among the senior
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that external stuff factored into our decision at
all,'' Frank Muehleman, vice president and general manager for the
Dell small-business division in Round Rock, Texas, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team we dealt with'' at Ammirati Puris, he added, ``which
is the team we will be working with, has been stable throughout the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammirati Puris was selected after a monthlong review that had
been narrowed to that agency and two others: Bronnercom in Boston,
formerly Bronner Slosberg Humphrey, and Temerlin McClain in Irving,
Texas, part of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The assignments awarded to Ammirati Puris had been handled by
Goldberg Moser O'Neill in San Francisco, which had worked for Dell
since August 1988. Goldberg Moser, which is majority owned by the
Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, resigned the assignments April 5,
along with Dell accounts involving computer sales to government
agencies, schools and in Latin and South America, soon after Dell
decided to undertake a review on the home and small-business group
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Ammirati Puris ``will likely get'' the additional Dell accounts
that Goldberg Moser had also handled, Muehleman said, adding that
the assignments awarded yesterday composed the bulk of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ammirati Puris has replaced Compaq with Dell, Goldberg
Moser re-entered the computer category, too, replacing the lost
Dell assignments last week with the account of Micron Electronics
in Nampa, Idaho, majority owned by Micron Technology, with billings
estimated at up to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles office of DDB Worldwide was involved in another
decision Thursday as the Wells Fargo Corp. in San Francisco
consolidated most of its advertising and marketing assignments
there. Billings were estimated at $45 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Los Angeles becomes the primary agency of record for Wells
Fargo after a four-month ``shootout'' between that agency and
Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of Interpublic. The
competition grew from the merger in November between the Norwest
Corp. in Minneapolis, whose agency was Carmichael Lynch, and the
old Wells Fargo, whose agency was DDB Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael Lynch will continue as the agency of record for the
Norwest Banks unit of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. Among the tasks
to be handled by DDB Los Angeles in addition to brand advertising
will be to promote a renaming for all Norwest banks in 16 states as
Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   On the baking-mix front, Aurora Foods Inc. in Columbus, Ohio,
further consolidated its portfolio of familiar brands with Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Chicago, part of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP
Group PLC, by awarding the agency the assignment for the Duncan
Hines product line. Billings on the account, which includes cake,
muffin, brownie and cookie mixes and frostings, were estimated at
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy Chicago was awarded Aurora's Log Cabin syrup account in
1997, followed by the Mrs. Butterworth's syrup assignment last
year. The Duncan Hines account comes from N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in
New York, part of MacManus Group, which had handled the brand since
1987, when it was still owned by the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.; P&AMP;G sold
Duncan Hines to Aurora in 1998 and Aurora at that time kept Ayer on
the account.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora has only recently started running a new campaign for
Duncan Hines from Ayer, carrying the theme ``You're why I bake,''
which seeks to stimulate consumers to bake more by striking
emotional chords. Now, though, Aurora said, it wanted to
consolidate more brands with one ``strategic marketing partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Casey, president and chief executive at Ayer, said:
``Unfortunately this business isn't always about doing great work.
And consolidations are sometimes an example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Sunbeam Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla., awarded the creative
part of the account of the Mr. Coffee line of appliances, with
billings estimated at $4 million to $5 million, to Moss/Dragoti
Advertising in New York, part of DDB Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after two months of meetings by executives at
Moss/Dragoti and Sunbeam that included Jo Anne Lala, senior vice
president for marketing. Spending is expected to increase next year
with the introduction of additional products under the Mr. Coffee
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Coffee and other Sunbeam brands, including Oster and
Coleman, had been handled by Ogilvy Chicago until that agency's
contract with the company expired on Dec. 31. Sunbeam's advertising
plans have been in flux since June, when Albert J. Dunlap, its
contentious chairman, was ousted.

RECALLING TUINEI: `ALWAYS SMILING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Former Cowboys offensive tackle Mark Tuinei,
pronounced dead after being found unconscious in his car yesterday
morning, was remembered at a solemn Cowboys headquarters yesterday
for his jovial nature and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei, 39, who played 15 seasons with the Cowboys and was the
anchor of an offensive line that keyed three Super Bowl titles, was
discovered early yesterday morning by a friend. The cause of death
has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cowboys players and coaches were left feeling a deep sense
of loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, it's been like losing an older brother,''
said a teary-eyed Daryl Johnston, who played nine seasons with
Tuinei. ``It's going to take a hard time to get over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said there is only one way to remember Tuinei, who was
known as the team's chief practical joker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will remember him in the way he was always was ... always
with a smile, always laughing, always enjoying life,'' Johnston
said. ``That's the way we want to remember Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys assistant coach Bill Bates was a teammate of Tuinei's
for 15 years. The two share the team's all-time service record with
former defensive end Ed Jones. Bates, also a roommate of Tuinei's
during their career, knew his fun side as well as anyone.
Yesterday, he wished this was one of those funny moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys that know him are going to think that this was one of
`Tui's' big jokes,'' Bates said. ``Unfortunately, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much fun with him. He was one guy who lived life to
the fullest. I can't find one person who spoke negatively of Mark.
We are all going to miss him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a regular practice day turned into what an
emotional Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called ``a great day of
sadness'' when news of Tuinei's death spread around the Cowboys'
training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Practice was called off and the players went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally shocking for all of us,'' Cowboys defensive
line coach Jim Bates said of the emotional locker room. ``It was
tough on us. The coaches didn't feel like coaching and the players
didn't feel like playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman, who relied on Tuinei to protect his
blind side when in the pocket, said ``right now there is a sense of
disbelief. I don't know anybody who can truly describe the emotion
that everybody is feeling. We are affected deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the nicest guys to ever wear a Cowboys uniform
.... He was such a great friend and teammate. When I look back on
the times with Mark, I will do so with a smile because of the type
of guy he was and the impact he had on so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's career ended following the 1997 season because of
lingering problems with both knees. The Cowboys released him in
April 1998 for salary cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   That the 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei lasted 15 years was a
testament to his talent and his determination. Undrafted after his
senior season at the University of Hawaii, he made the Cowboys'
roster as a free-agent defensive lineman in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei caught the attention of then-coach Tom Landry and
defensive line coach Ernie Stauntner because of his nasty on-field
attitude. In 1985, Tuinei was moved to offense, where he was tried
at center and tackle. He became a starter at left tackle midway
through the 1986 season and stayed there for 12 years, including
the Super Bowl title seasons of 1992, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of Tuinei's career was playing in the Pro
Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons in Hawaii. Often overlooked on
a dominant offensive line that included the quotable Nate Newton
and the intimidating Erik Williams, Tuinei savored the appreciation
of his peers, but he especially enjoyed getting to play in front of
friends and family in his native Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's tough side came from being raised in Nanakuli, a town
of about 10,000 on the island of Oahu. He often got into fights as
a youth and continued to get into trouble as a collegian. Tuinei
was kicked out of UCLA as a sophomore. He continued his bad-boy
ways when he transferred to the University of Hawaii. But a
three-month jail stint following his junior season prompted him to
change his ways, he once said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys took a chance on him as a free agent in 1983,
Tuinei was still nasty on the field, but off the field was evolving
into the person former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach once
called a ``gentle giant.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the person the Cowboys remembered yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a football player, he was someone who never asked for
anything other than an opportunity,'' Jones said. ``He made the
absolute best of all his opportunities. He was a consummate team
player. He came to work every day for 15 years. Our hearts are with
his loved ones, his wife, family and all who were touched by Mark
and called him a friend. This is a very sad time for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's wife, Pono, was in Hawaii at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said he was planning to move home next week and become
an assistant high school football coach at his alma mater, Punahou
School. The couple did not have any children. Memorial services
have not been set.

TEXAS HOUSE MOVES TOWARD $418 MILLION TAX CUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The House unexpectedly granted $418 million in
sales and franchise tax breaks Thursday, doubling the pricetag on a
package of proposals to help small businesses and families that buy
school supplies, nonprescription drugs and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   The same Republicans who prevailed in broadening the proposals
also snuffed out Democrats' attempts to limit their duration to two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the four separate bills were tentatively
approved by unanimous votes. After another round of votes today,
the bills go to the Senate for further consideration. That body has
approved a single tax-relief bill that included more than $600
million in various business and sales tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the House majority's feverish desire to maximize tax
breaks this year while the state is operating with a rare budget
surplus, proponents of the tax-break package withdrew a fifth bill
that would have exempted back-to-school clothing from sales taxes.
That measure, House Bill 2280, by Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston,
could have been amended to exempt almost anything from any sales
taxes, which legislative sponsors said the state cannot afford. It
will be retooled and resubmitted. It could reduce sales-tax
collections by about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the package said the state can barely absorb the
revenue losses as they were approved, though they comply with an
informal agreement to limit tax breaks to about $550 million. The
bills' proponents also warned that the amended versions, with their
higher pricetags, would eliminate the possibility of research and
development tax credits and a proposed sales-tax exemption on
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the House's actions would make it harder to increase
education spending and achieve Gov. George W. Bush's objective of
lowering property taxes by $2 billion, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was trying to do ... was present a balanced tax package
so we'd be able to do the other business tax cuts the governor
wanted and that the Republicans wanted,'' said House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the bottom line could be broad tax relief for
typical Texans _ something Democrats also favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is good for Texas consumers. What it is
not good for is the rest of the governor's tax (relief) package,''
Oliveira said.
</P>
<P>
   The House tentatively approved these tax-relief bills:
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 2371, by Rep. Roberto Gutierrez, D-McAllen, exempts
from the state's 6.25 percent sales tax diapers for children and
adults, other than those provided by diaper services. Cities were
given the option of continuing to collect sales taxes on diapers,
if they use the proceeds to back bonds. The exemption would reduce
state income by $63 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 209 by Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, exempts from
the sales tax the purchase of about 40 school supply items if
bought in August. Proposed at $25, the exemption was limited to
items costing less than $75. Items such as paper, pens, glue and
art supplies were listed. Home schoolers would be eligible for the
exemption, which also would apply to their textbook purchases. Its
impact on state revenues was estimated at a minimum of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 2372, also by Gutierrez, initially was proposed to
cover only over-the-counter children's medicines. On the floor, it
was amended first to include senior citizens and then to include
all nonprescription drugs for all buyers, raising its cost to $225
million.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 551 by Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, would exempt
from the franchise tax those corporations whose gross receipts fall
below $250,000 a year. It was amended upward from the proposed
$100,000, which increased its cost from $57 million to $120
million.

RUSSIANS SATISFIED AT RETURN TO THE DIPLOMATIC SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin's foreign-policy aides greeted
the new framework for peace in Kosovo with a hint of pleasure at
their return to the diplomatic spotlight and a determination that
the country not appear to be merely a tool of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's domestic advisers could not help but regard it as a
small but significant victory for the president, who has struggled
to control Russia's policy on Yugoslavia in the face of ever more
militant _ and popular _ anti-Western oratory by Communist and
nationalist forces.
</P>
<P>
   In statements after the agreement was made public, Yeltsin's
envoy to the United Nations, Sergei Lavrov, and Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov were quick to emphasize that they believed Western
intransigence remained the major roadblock to peace talks and an
end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov said the West had only now agreed to terms for peace
negotiations that Russia had been proposing for weeks. Ivanov used
the announcement for renewed strenuous criticism of NATO's air war
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to talk about any sense of satisfaction today
because unfortunately, NATO's bombing and missile attacks go on,
people go on dying and the flow of refugees goes on,'' Ivanov said.
``After a long period, we've managed to get the settlement of this
problem back to the United Nations, which alone is capable of
solving this.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements echoed the increasingly hostile attacks on the
West in general, and the United States in particular, that have
come from the Kremlin in the last few weeks. Yeltsin has steadily
edged Russia's policy on the Kosovo situation from moderate
criticism of the West to threats of a diplomatic breach and war, as
many average Russians have come to regard NATO as the agent of a
new, anti-Russian Western empire.
</P>
<P>
   Even Thursday, hours before the agreement was announced, Yeltsin
accused NATO of ``naked aggression'' against Yugoslavia and warned
that ``the shadow of war is hanging over Europe.'' His criticism
was part of a statement marking the 55th anniversary of Russian
liberation of the Ukrainian seaport of Sevastopol from Nazi troops.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the attacks has been to steal some of
the thunder of the Communists and nationalists who control Russia's
legislature, and who have demanded that Russia give Serbia weapons
and even its own forces to battle NATO jets.
</P>
<P>
   The two blocs will vote within days in the lower house of the
legislature on whether to impeach Yeltsin, a move that probably
would erase any political power the president has managed to retain
after a year of illness and economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever Yeltsin's oratory, Russia's actual involvement in
the Kosovo situation has been directed not by hard-liners, but by
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a Yeltsin ally who is a
familiar and moderate face in dealings with the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's brokering of Thursday's agreement on a framework
for peace talks gives Yeltsin an increasingly rare political and
diplomatic victory on the eve of the legislature's impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's critics have asserted for weeks that Chernomyrdin was
destined to become a stooge for the West, delivering NATO
ultimatums to Serbia rather than negotiating a peace.
</P>
<P>
   The daily newspaper Izvestia suggested this week that the United
States was merely paying lip service to Chernomyrdin's efforts as a
cost-free way to demonstrate good will toward Moscow. In reality,
the newspaper asserted, Washington was using Chernomyrdin to divide
Russia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But parts of Thursday's pact appeared to mirror what
Chernomyrdin and other Russian officials have been publicly
proposing in the last two weeks. Chernomyrdin said on Sunday, for
example, that Serbia would agree to the placement of armed
peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, said during a visit
to Norway this week that the Yugoslavia crisis could not be solved
without an international military presence in Kosovo, and proposed
using the armed forces of those Scandinavian countries that are not
in NATO.

   A fifth defendant in the case is a sergeant, Michael Bellomo,
who is accused of trying to cover up the alleged beating of Louima
in the police car. All the defendants say the charges against them
are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The case was originally prosecuted in state court by the
Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, who turned it over to
the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary Carter, for federal
prosecution, in part because convictions in federal court could
bring stiffer punishments. Volpe and Schwarz could be sentenced to
up to life in prison if they are convicted of attacking Louima with
the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Describing what happened in the station house, Louima said the
officer identified by prosecutors as Schwarz brought him into the
restroom after loosening Louima's belt and pulling his pants and
underwear down to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I get inside the bathroom, Officer Volpe close the
door and I saw him pick up something by the garbage can,'' said
Louima, who added that his hands were cuffed behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened then?'' Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pushes me to the ground,'' the witness said, adding that
his face was ``close to the toilet bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he kick me on my groin,'' Louima replied, going from
there to a description of punches he said he suffered and the stick
attack that he said was inflicted on him.

LAWMAKERS, BACKING BILL FOR KOSOVO, ADD BILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Thursday night to spend billions of
dollars for the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia that it
declined to endorse days ago. Its Republican leaders vowed to pour
billions more into a military they said President Clinton had
gutted.
</P>
<P>
   Rewriting the deeply mixed message it sent on the battle in the
Balkans last week, the House approved Clinton's $6 billion request
to finance the air war and to aid refugees. It added almost $7
billion in Pentagon programs, many of which bear no direct relation
to the fighting in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the $13 billion military spending bill was 311-105.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the House rejected, by a tie vote, a nonbinding
resolution expressing support for the airstrikes. Republicans voted
overwhelmingly against that measure in a symbolic condemnation of
President Clinton's policies. Thursday night, they voted for the
Pentagon, not for the president as commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my colleagues who disagree with the president's policy, let
me say simply, you had your vote last week,'' said Speaker Dennis
Hastert, who had been silent during that earlier vote. ``Today, let
there be no mistake. The United States Congress stands with its
soldiers, sailors and airmen as they defend America.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority whip, Rep. Tom Delay of Texas, said, ``While we may
not support the president's ill-advised war, we do support our
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency spending bill _ to which $106 million in aid for
American farmers was added by amendment, bringing the total to
$13.1 billion _ will go to a House-Senate conference next week. The
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said that the
Senate might well cut it; some senators want to spend no more than
the original $6 billion request.
</P>
<P>
   Honing political themes for next year's election campaigns, the
Republicans said that Clinton's foreign policies and military
practices had plunged the United States into a national security
crisis. They warned that U.S. soldiers would die in combat without
more money for a military starved for bombs and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any coherent international blueprint, the White House
has bombed its way around the globe while dropping troops far and
wide for ill-defined peacemaking duties,'' Delay said. ``This
policy has gutted the American military, which now must be
rebuilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., the Armed Services subcommittee
chairman, argued earlier that ``we are looking at body bags
stretched out in front of us,'' filled with ``dead Americans who
ran out of ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency spending would come from surplus Social Security
funds, which both parties have promised not to touch. But ``without
national security, there is no Social Security,'' Hunter said
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, sought to cut $1.2 billion from the bill,
which he said would leave enough ``to support every possible
requirement'' the military faced.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that Republicans, having held control of Congress and
the federal budget since 1995, were to blame for any real or
imagined shortfalls at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The money requested by the White House to finance the bombing
campaign would pay for 24-hour-a-day air strikes through the end of
September, he said, adding, ``We will run out of targets before we
run out of missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, 137 voted for the spending bill, though
many said they supported only the $6 billion request. The House
bill adds $5.8 billion in military programs to that request, which
covered military operations in the Balkans and Iraq as well as $566
million in aid for war refugees and assistance to the nations
taking them in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money added by the House would go for military
weapons, operations, training, recruitment and pay increases. The
emergency bill also includes nearly $1.1 billion to build military
installations in NATO nations and in the Persian Gulf, and $50
million for a new U.S. Embassy in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Obey's amendment to cut the spending bill was defeated 164 to
260, with 45 Democrats joining 215 Republicans. An amendment backed
by three conservative Republicans to finance the bill by cutting
domestic programs by about 5 percent lost on a 101-to-322 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment, sponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla.,
would have barred U.S. ground troops from the Balkans. It lost,
117-301.

SPACE SAGA'S LATEST STORY NOW IN COMIC FORM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, you've found all 21 action figures, including the four
scarce Battle Droid variations: clean, dirty, slashed and blasted.
</P>
<P>
   You've purchased all the posters, including the Jedi vs. Sith
battle scene and the circus-style pitch for pod races.
</P>
<P>
   Welcoming plot ``spoilers,'' you've amassed a complete set of
the trading cards and begun reading the novel.
</P>
<P>
   But do you have the comic books for ``Star Wars: Episode One _
The Phantom Menace?''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, George Lucas' space saga owes much to comics, which
fanned the flames of fan interest through most of the lean years
between 1983's ``Return of the Jedi'' and the wave of enthusiasm
sparked by new ``Star Wars'' toys in 1995 and the first trilogy's
``Special Edition'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   From the lulls through the current storm, comics by Marvel and
Dark Horse have adapted the films and expanded on Lucas' universe.
Now they're attacking the prequel years with a comics adaptation of
``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   It's sold as a single graphic novel costing $12.95 and also as a
four-part series of comics, costing $2.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic novel and the first issue of the comics are now in
comic book shops. The final three comics will arrive weekly for
three more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The comics have two cover options: a photo from the film, and an
illustrated montage of characters by Hugh Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   They were written by Henry Gilroy, who works in the
comics/animation industry. He got a copy of Lucas' script a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Translating the film to the static medium of comics is
difficult, Gilroy said. ``Lucas makes the most of motion and sound
in his films.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to pace the story ``so that every time the reader turns
the page, they get a cool `reveal,' which is what you get in a
''Star Wars`` movie. Every scene has something new in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The comics were penciled by Rodolfo Damaggio and inked by comics
artist Al Williamson (``Flash Gordon,'' ``Tales from the Crypt'').
</P>
<P>
   Dark Horse has published ``Star Wars'' comics since 1991.
Besides adapting the first films, it's produced titles such as
``Tales of the Jedi,'' ``X-Wing Rogue Squadron'' and ``Vader's
Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   The comics have been steady sellers, and some of the old Marvel
``Star Wars'' comics _ published from 1977-86 _ are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue costs around $40. About 1,500 copies came with a
35-cent price, instead of the usual 30 cents, and these sell for
about $500 in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   Due to low print runs, also valuable are Marvel's final issues,
ending with No. 107. Those can sell for about $40.

THE E IN ESPN STANDS FOR ERROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ESPN has done a commendable job making itself out
to be the victim in this latest tiff with Major League Baseball,
which resulted in a lawsuit filed Tuesday to prevent MLB from
ending their $40 million per year contract three years early.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, baseball has every right to be miffed.
Likewise, it has every right to cut off its nose to spite its face.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be up to a federal judge to decide what ``events of
significant interest'' means. That's the key phrase in the contract
that allows ESPN to move up to 10 games a season because of
conflicts, and it doesn't have to consult the league on it.
</P>
<P>
   To ESPN, this means it can show NFL regular-season games on
three Sunday nights this September instead of three baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   To baseball _ and there's no doubt it has developed an
inferiority complex when it comes to the NFL _ the phrase has come
to mean ``you never asked us about this when you signed the deal
with the NFL 16 months ago if we'd be OK to move games to ESPN2, so
if you do it now, it'll give you carte blanche to move games for
anything else you consider important.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFL game in that Sunday night slot will draw ratings almost
six times greater than a baseball game. No duh. But if projected
ratings become the foundation of defining an event of significant
interest, baseball argues that ESPN could sign up the World
Wrestling Federation and decide its shows were worth bumping
baseball for.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ESPN has used this clause to move games out of the
Wednesday night window for events like U.S. Open golf, the World
Cup, the College World Series and even Busch Grand National races;
the next will be June 2 because of a conflict with the NHL
playoffs. But that's Wednesday night. Sunday night is an entirely
different programming beast, which baseball wants to again point
out to the network. When ESPN tried to move three baseball games to
ESPN2 last September, baseball took them away and gave them back to
the teams to do with what they wanted. As a result, a fortuitous
national telecast of the game when Cal Ripken's consecutive-game
playing streak ended was shown only locally.
</P>
<P>
   The 76.2-million-homes-strong ESPN will counterpoint that ESPN2
goes into just 12 million fewer homes, and these three games are
just nine hours of programming compared to the more than 80 games
and 500 hours of regular-season time they give to the sport, and
have for most of the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been baseball's best friend,'' says Dick Glover, ESPN's
vice president of programming. ``This isn't about the NFL or ESPN2.
It's about that deal that baseball was thrilled about when it was
signed. We're happy to live up the deal. Now they've gone to a
rather extreme step of saying they're going to terminate the entire
thing. We feel we've been baseball's best partner.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes friends do crummy things to friends. And in this
case, you're a friend as long as the checks keep clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another goofy take: In the big picture, Disney-owned ESPN has a
huge vested interest in baseball since it also owns the Angels. So
when baseball announced on April 21 it was ending the contract
after the 1999 season, it might not have had Disney's blessing, but
Disney didn't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Now look: the mouse will be funding lawyers on both sides of the
table to resolve this.
</P>
<P>
   The other spin ESPN has subtly put on this is _ whenever it has
tried to resolve this issue with baseball, it says the league has
turned it down and would ask to renegotiate the contract for three
times, or $130 million a season, more than what ESPN is paying now.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that someone has put the bug in baseball's
ear that it's not getting enough money for its product and there
are others willing to pay more for it. That, of course, points to
Fox, which would be the most likely to benefit from a
regular-season package even if it means getting into a bidding war
with Ted Turner. Then, Fox could take over Sunday night cable
baseball instead of the Thursday night package it currently has in
place.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Fox or Turner can comment. But you know privately
they're not too upset to watch Disney squirm on both sides of this
issue. If a baseball cable package falls into their laps, they'll
accommodate it.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is ESPN dropped the ball and baseball finally got
tired of being charged with the error, no matter how many hours of
programming it has received in return. A deal's a deal. And this
has become a big deal that someone _ most likely Disney _ is going
to have to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse spin: Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson, who now
calls himself a sports consultant, is readily available to comment
on issues like this. Which is akin to asking the captain of the
Titanic about the benefits of oceanic travel.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Daily Variety quotes Pilson in its ESPN-MLB story as
pointing out that baseball's ratings are so low because ``the
demographics ... are old, lower-income people who live in rural
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Pilson who, when leading the charge at CBS nine
years ago, felt baseball was worth a $1 billion, four-year deal.
That eventually destroyed his network's sports division and made
baseball such an anti-Madison Avenue that CBS was basically giving
away 30-second spots on the 1993 World Series telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Pilson might want to check his contacts again about baseball
demographics in 1999. All five Major League Baseball
national-rights holders saw an increase in ratings last year over
the year before, and not just because of Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire games on Fox, for example, were just 7 percent higher
than other telecasts. Compare that to NBC's NBA numbers, which saw
a 42 percent jump whenever Michael Jordan played.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the World Series ratings broken down last year showed male
teen ratings were up 27 percent. And in households earning $60,000
or more, baseball on Fox increased 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the tip of the iceberg, Neal.
</P>
<P>

_The new guy ESPN has on its NHL studio show ... oh wait, that's
Barry Melrose. A neatly cut, bespectacled former Kings coach ...
who must be angling for a return engagement in the NHL _ and the
Kings have a spot open, gosh darn it. ``It's no challenge to coach
the Kings anymore,'' Melrose said. ``New owners, new building ...
anyone can coach a team like that.'' In all seriousness, Melrose
considers Ice Dogs coach John Van Boxmeer to be the best choice for
the Kings' spot, even if his name isn't brought up much in media
speculation. ``Usually the guy who gets the job is someone whose
name doesn't come up,'' said Melrose, in his fourth year at ESPN.
``It was the same with me when I got that job. I wish Dave Taylor
the best of luck finding a coach and I hope he gets it turned
around.'' So that means Melrose isn't interested? ``I've had
chances to come back and coach but they weren't quite right,'' he
said. ``I'd love to come back. I miss being with the players. But
then you see what (former coach turned ESPN analyst turned coach
again) Jim Schoenfeld is going through, and you wonder why you'd

THE E IN ESPN STANDS FOR ERROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ESPN has done a commendable job making itself out
to be the victim in this latest tiff with Major League Baseball,
which resulted in a lawsuit filed Tuesday to prevent MLB from
ending their $40 million per year contract three years early.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, baseball has every right to be miffed.
Likewise, it has every right to cut off its nose to spite its face.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be up to a federal judge to decide what ``events of
significant interest'' means. That's the key phrase in the contract
that allows ESPN to move up to 10 games a season because of
conflicts, and it doesn't have to consult the league on it.
</P>
<P>
   To ESPN, this means it can show NFL regular-season games on
three Sunday nights this September instead of three baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   To baseball _ and there's no doubt it has developed an
inferiority complex when it comes to the NFL _ the phrase has come
to mean ``you never asked us about this when you signed the deal
with the NFL 16 months ago if we'd be OK to move games to ESPN2, so
if you do it now, it'll give you carte blanche to move games for
anything else you consider important.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFL game in that Sunday night slot will draw ratings almost
six times greater than a baseball game. No duh. But if projected
ratings become the foundation of defining an event of significant
interest, baseball argues that ESPN could sign up the World
Wrestling Federation and decide its shows were worth bumping
baseball for.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ESPN has used this clause to move games out of the
Wednesday night window for events like U.S. Open golf, the World

<P>
   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. _ His fists balled tight and his eyes opened
on a new world, the first American was born here Thursday from the
Kosovar exodus, less than 24 hours after his mother arrived from a
refugee camp in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to name the baby America, but I have to talk to my
wife and parents first,'' Naim Karaliju, 28, the overwhelmed
father, said at Burlington County Memorial Hospital a half-hour
after his wife, Lebibe, gave birth to their first child. Doctors
said that Karaliju hugged the 7 pound 7.7 ounce boy close to his
heart when they presented him with the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, it's a boy,'' he blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   On their first full day at Fort Dix, where the refugees are
expected to remain for several weeks, families played on the grass
behind a four-foot-tall wooden fence. Three women were sent to
Burlington County Memorial Hospital, one for blood clots in her
leg, and another for uterine bleeding. A 77-year-old woman,
suffering from chronic lung disease, was held in isolation, while
doctors determined whether she was suffering from infectious
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Karaliju, 21, who was among the first 453 of 20,000
Albanian refugees from Kosovo who came to the United States
Wednesday, told immigration officials in Macedonia that she was
only seven months pregnant, apparently in order to be able to
travel. But during the 13-hour flight from Skopje, Macedonia, she
began to feel weak, and doctors at the hospital here found that the
expectant mother was dehydrated and about to give birth. She later
told doctors that Thursday was her due date.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Snyder, the doctor who delivered her baby, said that
Mrs. Karaliju's blood was Rh negative, a condition that could
threaten any future pregnancies she might have, and which she would
probably never have discovered in the refugee camp where she was
just days before.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, himself, appeared taken by the horizon that suddenly
appeared before the newborn, so different from that the baby would
have faced had his mother stayed in the Stankovic refugee camp,
packed to triple capacity when they left. ``Who knows what's going
to happen?'' the doctor asked. ``This child could be the president
of the United States one day.''
</P>
<P>
   During pauses in Mrs. Karaliju's labor, Snyder said, he asked
her about the events that made her family refugees. She told him
that Serbian paramilitary forces bearing weapons came into the
family's home in the Kosovar village of Ferizaj, and gave them 30
minutes to leave their home forever. The expulsion, she told him,
came six weeks ago, before NATO began bombing the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After talking to her, I thought this really proves that we
need to be fighting there,'' the doctor said. Snyder, who is
Jewish, said that because of the extermination of Jews in Europe
during the Holocaust, he felt he understood the trauma and
injustice of ethnic cleansing today. Albania was one of two
countries, along with Denmark, that made a policy of refusing to
hand over their Jews to be killed by Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Karaliju, the new father, told a press conference that he was
glad when NATO began bombing Serbia. ``That meant there was help
out there,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   As the child gazed out of his bassinet in the hospital nursery,
wrapped in a red and white blanket, his father headed back to Fort
Dix, where the Immigration and Naturalization Service was giving
the newcomers a day of rest before beginning the long work of
screening them for official acceptance by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lavinia Limon, director of the Health and Human Services
agency's Office of Refugee Resettlement, said that the refugees'
reception Wednesday night did not go as smoothly as everyone hoped.
Machines broke down, computers froze, and extended families,
fearful of being separated, insisted on remaining together, slowing
down interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration screening, which involves medical, security and
background checks, will take several weeks, with nonprofit
resettlement agencies placing the refugees in apartments and jobs
across the United States once they are approved. A second charter
flight of 400 more or so refugees is expected here Friday; 100 more
refugees with relatives in the United States are to arrive Saturday
at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

ROBERT BERGMAN, 53, HEAD OF CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert P. Bergman, director of the Cleveland Museum of Art since
1993 and a nationally recognized spokesman for arts institutions,
died Thursday at University Hospitals in Cleveland. He would have
been 54 on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman died after a two-week illness with a rare blood
disorder, said William Prenevost, a spokesman for the museum. He
was admitted to University Hospitals on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as well known as Sherman E. Lee, who directed the
museum from 1958 to 1983 and built it into one of the world's
leading showplaces of Asian art, Bergman participated widely in
national cultural affairs and published and lectured widely on
subjects ranging from medieval art and architecture to the role of
museums in contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   And he was an enthusiast. ``This is a good time for museums,''
he told Judith H. Dobrzynski of The New York Times in 1997. When he
had left a promising academic career at Harvard 16 years
previously, he recalled, ``I got a lot of pats on my shoulder from
my colleagues _ a lot of `Poor Bob, there he goes to dust off the
sarcophagi.' Museums were on a trajectory to be marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   But the '90s were shaping up to be a golden age of art museums.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that popularity could be a corrupting influence,
Bergman acknowledged the problem. ``We'll be under pressure to
increase revenues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he was more concerned about the shrinking and
graying of the art-literate audience. ``Kids are not getting
exposed to music and art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman was immediate past chairman of the board of the American
Association of Museums, the largest national association of museums
and museum professionals, which held its annual meeting in
Cleveland last week. He served as president of the Association of
Art Museum Directors and was immediate past-chairman of the board
of the American Arts Alliance, the lobbying group for a wide
variety of art organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While director of the Cleveland Museum, Bergman saw annual
attendance rise from more than 400,000 to more than 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The major shows at the museum that he oversaw included
``Pharaohs: Treasures of Egyptian Art from the Louvre,'' ``Faberge
in America,'' and ``Vatican Treasures: Early Christian, Renaissance
and Baroque Art from the Papal Collections.'' Bergman served as
co-curator of the last of these.

   EVERY U.S. INCOME GROUP SEEMS TO BE SPENDING MORE
</P>
<P>
   American consumers are spending faster than they did last year.
In the first four months of this year, sales in stores open at
least a year rose 6.7 percent, one of the biggest jumps in years.
That came on top of a dizzying 5.1 percent increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts and economists point to numerous factors,
including the continued rise of both the stock market and home
values, to explain much of the gains. But another change is also
helping: While the wealthiest consumers powered the expansion in
its early stages, spending by those in the bottom 40 percent of
income has been picking up. Real growth in wages and the lowest
unemployment rate in 30 years have spread the shopping spree into
every corner of American society.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL SALES ROSE 3 PERCENT IN APRIL
</P>
<P>
   Sales at retail stores open at least a year rose 3 percent in
April as shoppers snapped up spring fashions at clothing chains
such as Ann Taylor and department stores. But sales at some of the
biggest retailers may start to slow, analysts and investors said.
That could hurt stocks like Gap and Wal-Mart that have surged.
Thursday, shares of Wal-Mart fell $2.1875, to $42.875, even though
its sales met expectations.

   INSURERS AGREE ON HOLOCAUST CLAIMS

<P>
   NO BREAK IN TRADE GROUP'S DEADLOCK

   PRICES OF STOCKS AND BONDS SLIDE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
said the ``spectacular rise in equity prices'' might be ``beyond
the justifiable.'' The Dow Jones industrial average slid 8.59
points, to 10,946.82. The Nasdaq composite index skidded 62.17
points, or 2.45 percent, to 2,472.28, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 15.26 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,332.05.
Treasury prices tumbled, driving the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond up to 5.78 percent from 5.70 percent.

IRWINDALE OFFICIAL SAYS FANS ARE SAFE HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ A crash similar to the one at Lowe's Motor
Speedway near Charlotte, N.C., last weekend is not likely to happen
at Irwindale Speedway, track promoter and vice president Ray
Wilkings said this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, three died and eight were injured when a tire and
suspension parts flew into the grandstand after a crash in the
VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League event. The accident happened less
than a year after a similar crash at Michigan Speedway in Brooklyn,
Mich., killed three. They too were hit by flying tires and
suspension debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fences are more updated than Charlotte's,'' Wilkings said.
``We have the same type of fence that was put in after the Michigan
(incident). We have a superspeedway fence on a short track. Most
tracks don't have this type of fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the IRL raced at the 1.5-mile high-banked Charlotte oval
in 1997, the track fence's height was increased to 15 feet. After
the Michigan race last July, the catch fence was raised to 17{ feet
and more webbing was added.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale's catch fence is also 17{ feet with the additional
webbing. The outer wall on the outside half-mile track is about 20
feet away from the first row in the 6,500-seat grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have the safest fence you can have,'' Wilkings
said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale also has an advantage in that most of its events are
for NASCAR vehicles, which means the wheels do not protrude from
the car. However, there are 11 open-wheel races at the track this
season. Two have already been run with one on-track incident, the
death of sprint car driver Casey Diemert of Roseburg, Ore., who
clipped the wheel of another car, went airborne and then slammed
into a wall during the opening-night practice. A U.S. Auto Club
show, featuring sprints and midgets, is scheduled for Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel cars' parts are designed to break away from the car
in an accident, hopefully sparing the driver serious injury.
Frequently, it's the tires and suspension that are tossed first.
Formula One organizing body FIA this year began requiring teams to
install a tether to keep wheels and suspensions from breaking away
from the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the speed of the cars. At Charlotte and
Michigan, the accidents happened when the cars were doing at least
200 mph. The lap record at Irwindale is 114.979, set by Davey
Hamilton in a WSMRA Super Modifieds event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of types of race cars here, but the type of cars
that do race here do not get to superspeedway speeds,'' Wilkings
said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no deaths at Charlotte or Michigan until the past
two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about having something like this happen and you try
to think of everything you can do to prevent it,'' Lowe's track
president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler said. ``It's a violent sport. You
never know what's going to happen next and you have to take the
known things that have happened and quantify them and learn from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers say Charlotte's 25-degree banking is the source
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those high-banked tracks are impossible, the speeds too
incredible,'' former CART driver Mario Andretti told the Charlotte
Observer. ``We have to do silly things, crazy things, stupid things
just to slow the cars down. The speeds are just unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gappens, a speedway vice president, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the Indy cars have run on banked tracks for many
years. I think the (IRL) has been very responsible in their
research,'' he said. ``If you look at the history, up until
Saturday night, there hasn't been a problem'' at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   No spectators have been hurt or killed by flying debris at
either California Speedway, site of NASCAR and CART 500-mile races,
nor on the street circuit of Long Beach, site of the CART Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Parts from exploding dragsters _ usually the blowers _ have
occasionally been thrown into the grandstand at Pomona Raceway
during the Winternationals and Winston Finals. Fans have been taken
to area hospitals after being hit by debris, but none for serious
injuries. &QL;

PHIL JACKSON, TRAVELING CAMPAIGN TRAIL, POSTPONES MEETING WITH
NETS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Four weeks after pulling off a trade for
the spectacular Stephon Marbury in mid-March, the New Jersey Nets'
principal owner, Lewis Katz, was scheduled to meet with another
prominent basketball personality about joining his team.
</P>
<P>
   The date with Phil Jackson never took place, though, because
Todd Musberger, Jackson's agent, called to postpone.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was busy traveling the presidential campaign trail for
Bill Bradley, the former senator and former basketball player for
the New York Knicks. An agreement to meet later was set, Musberger
told Katz.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets' tumultuous season having ended Wednesday, Katz
and Jackson are likely to have that meeting within the next week or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the universally coveted coach who led Michael Jordan's
Chicago Bulls to six league championships, appears to be at the top
of a slate that is probably shorter than the list of playoff teams
the Nets beat this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' owners and department heads met Thursday to discuss
their coaching search and other possible moves in what could be an
active off season. In addition to hiring a head coach, the Nets
will look to strengthen themselves at the center position via free
agency or a trade, find a small forward to back up Keith Van Horn
or Kendall Gill, re-sign Jamie Feick and extend Van Horn's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, settling their coaching situation is the top
priority, and that could be as simple as receiving a yes or a no
from Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The interim coach, Don Casey, and his assistants _ Eddie Jordan,
Jim Lynam, Mike O'Koran and Hal Wissel _ did an excellent job in
achieving a 13-17 record despite losing Jayson Williams, Jim
McIlvaine, Scott Burrell, Eric Murdock and Van Horn to
season-ending injuries. Casey and company would seem to be the
Nets' second choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coaching staff has already received a favorable
evaluation,'' Michael Rowe, the Nets' president, said. ``They will
receive serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the players, including the co-captains Gill and
Williams, along with Van Horn, think that Casey, who replaced the
ousted John Calipari, should get the job regardless of the
availability of Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play for anybody else,'' Gill said. ``Case,
Jimmy Lynam, Eddie Jordan _ since I've been in the league this is
the best coaching staff that I've played for. All of the guys love
them. Phil Jackson is a great coach. I can't take anything away
from him. But when you take away a coach that the players love, it
kind of puts bad salt in their wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who reported Thursday that he is ahead of schedule in
the rehabilitation of his broken right leg, said, said: ``Let's
keep what everybody likes. I hate change. The ship was going toward
that big iceberg, and Case righted the ship. So let's stay with
Case. He's my No. 1 pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Marbury, who in March strongly expressed his desire to play
for Jackson, has taken to Casey. When asked if he would be bothered
if Casey and his staff are retained, Marbury said: ``I would have
no problem with that. I love Case. Case is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has received offers from four other clubs and will
certainly be pursued by the Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers if
both teams falter in the playoffs. He could also choose to continue
working with Bradley's presidential campaign and suspend his return
to coaching for another year. Two Eastern Conference officials said
they believe that Jackson will either stick with Bradley or go to
Los Angeles, assuming the Lakers replace their interim coach, Kurt
Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the path would seem clear for Casey. The only
hitch could be if Jordan and Lynam, both head-coaching candidates
in their own right, did not return as assistants. The feeling
throughout the Nets' management is that one or both of those
assistants must return for Casey to get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he definitely wants to rejoin Casey's staff in New
Jersey, and would leave only if he received an offer to be a head
coach elsewhere. Lynam said he is unsure of what he will do.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Silas, who did an exceptional job as the Charlotte Hornets'
interim coach, is a possible coaching candidate for the Nets in the
unlikely event that the Hornets do not make him a satisfactory
offer.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks fire Jeff Van Gundy, he would probably be
considered. The Cleveland Cavaliers' coach, Mike Fratello, also has
been mentioned, but many within the Nets' organization believe that
his personality and coaching style are too similar to Calipari's.
There is little chance of the Nets hiring a coach directly out of
college.

 By BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Plain old water is becoming the sexiest drink for
companies in Mexico looking for double-digit growth in beverage
sales. At a time when the soft-drink business is losing its fizz,
it's firing up a segment that five years ago barely existed. ``The
bottled-water market is just as big as the soft-drink market, and
it's growing faster,'' says Mauricio Vergara, who handles the Ciel
brand for Coca-Cola de Mexico. ``We want to be there.''
 &HT;    So do Pepsi, Nestle and Danone. All four multinationals are
vying for the top spot in a business worth an estimated $11 billion
annually. The market is divided into two major segments, the small,
high-margin business of bottles holding less than two liters and
the large, low-margin, 20-liter jug market that accounts for 90
percent of sales. So far, Danone and Pepsi-Gemex, Mexico's largest
Pepsi bottler, are the front-runners in the small and large
markets, respectively, in a battle that promises to be bigger than
the famed Cola Wars.
 &HT;    Bottled-water consumption grew 12 percent last year, and now
accounts for 18 percent of ``stomach share,'' a measure of
everything Mexicans drink, says Vergara. And tap-water consumption
is falling fast in the country that gave the world the expression,
Don't drink the water.'
 &HT;    About two years ago, Coke launched its Ciel brand into the hotly
contested small-size segment. Using its strong advertising and
distribution base, Coca-Cola has won 12 percent share in a fierce
fight with Danone's market-leading brand Bonafont, and Santa Maria
(Nestle), which have 15 percent and 13 percent, respectively. And
Ciel is now looking for a larger piece of the jug market, where the
dominant player is Pepsi-Gemex.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't want to overstate our competition with Gemex,
because we've been focused on different segments of the water
market,'' says Vergara. ``But now we both want more, so you never
know.''
 &HT;    At the same time, Pepsi-Gemex is making a play for a larger
share of the market for small-size bottles, betting on help from
its Electropura brand in the 20-liter jug category. ``We think we
have a lot to offer customers in the small-size segment; they know
our quality and our prices are competitive,'' says Irma Montemayor,
who handles the Electropura brand at Pepsi-Gemex. ``And if Ciel
moves into the jug market, well, nothing is stopping us from
winning more of the small-size market.''
 &HT;    To be sure, nobody is ignoring carbonated soft drinks and the
segment continues to grow. Consumption of Coca-Cola products rose 6
percent last year, and a bit more for Pepsi. Mexico is still
Coca-Cola's second largest market in the world after the U.S. and a
key market for Pepsi as well, so the epic Cola Wars are hardly a
thing of the past.
 &HT;    But bottled water is catching on big time and Ciel's growth is
fueling heated competition. Danone advertisements feature athletic
types running through forests, then pausing to chug its Bonafont or
Evian brands. Agua Santa Maria (Nestle) sports a priest telling hip
teenagers that the water he drinks is pure like ``well, the Mother
of God.
 &HT;    Both campaigns are aimed at stressing the spring-water origins
of Bonafont and Santa Maria, which Danone and Nestle are trying to
position as a higher-brow beverage than the purified water on tap
at Ciel and Electropura.
 &HT;    ``Ciel has the marketing and distribution strength of Coca-Cola
behind it, and they have grown,'' says Hilda Paredes, a spokeswoman
at Agua Santa Maria, which draws its water from a mountain well in
the state of Puebla. ``But our product is different, it's from a
natural well, and people are starting to realize that.''
 &HT;    Besides getting away from Mexico's often dirty tap water,
another force is also pushing bottled-water consumptiona cultural
shift that has transformed water from a boring drink into a status
symbol for increasingly health-conscious twenty- and
thirtysomethings. ``Drinking bottled water is part of the new
culture that a lot of people are adopting,'' says Israel Garces
Crespo, a physical trainer at a Mexico City gym.
 &HT;    With four multinationals pushing different brands of water, that
new culture appears to be here to stay.

 Rivalry Comes to Toll Calls
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Starting today, California consumers have a new way to get cheaper
phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   That's because customers now can choose any phone company as
their local toll carrier and are no longer required to use Pacific
Bell. Local toll calls are calls made to regional numbers that are
more than 12 miles away but are not long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   So get ready for more dinnertime calls from phone companies
hawking their service. Already, competitors are slashing prices and
aggressively marketing their ability to carry these calls.
</P>
<P>
   Mark C. Brucker, a telecommunications consultant in Berkeley,
said customers need to review their phone bills to figure out if
they would save with a carrier other than Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the switch makes the most sense for those who have
large bills for toll calls,'' Brucker said.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to switch to a new local toll provider if you:
</P>
<P>
   _Make calls during weekday business hours, when Pac Bell's rates
are the highest.
</P>
<P>
   _Make short calls, since Pac Bell charges more for the first
minute than for additional minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _Tend to call locations more than 40 miles away, where Pac
Bell's rates run the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who should stick with Pac Bell include people who make few
toll calls or who have one of the company's savings plans, Brucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Californians make a lot of local toll calls _ about 25
percent of all local toll calls are made within the state _
consumers stand to save a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom estimates that Californians will save more than
$150 million with local toll competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be easier for people to save money,'' said
Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst with The Utility Reform
Network, a consumer group. ``Everybody in the state makes one of
these calls at some point. They could save $5 or $10 a month; it
just depends on the volume of calls they make.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, San Francisco customers who called someone in San
Jose by dialing 1 plus 408 and the number would pay Pac Bell a
toll. If such customers wanted to use another company, such as
AT&AMP;T, they had to dial a special seven-digit access code to get
around Pac Bell's network.
</P>
<P>
   Customers now can select AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom or another carrier
as their local toll provider, much as they choose a long-distance
company.
</P>
<P>
   But don't grab the phone just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The prices being offered by alternate carriers are competitive,
but not all customers are candidates for switching. Those who want
to switch should be aware of monthly fees and other requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the discounts on local toll calls will come to customers
who choose the same company for their local toll and long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T just lowered its local toll rates to 5 cents per minute,
down from 7 cents, but the rate applies only to customers on an
AT&AMP;T long-distance plan. MCI and Sprint also give preferential toll
rates to their long-distance customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really encourage customers to give us all their business in
order to get the best benefits,'' said Joyce Dorris, director of
brand marketing for MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell offers cheaper rates to customers who buy lots of local
toll minutes, but unless you use all the included minutes, consumer
advocates say, customers can wind up paying more than the
advertised rates.
</P>
<P>
   To help decide whether to switch carriers, consumers can check
out the WebPricer, a service on the World Wide Web provided by
consumer advocates that calculates the cost of each local toll
call. The site is located at &LR;  http://ora.ca.gov &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether a call is classified as a local toll or
long-distance call, customers can call a Pac Bell operator or check
the front of the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Today has been long anticipated by both consumers and phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Californians have been waiting for the savings promised by the
1996 Telecommunications Act. Until now, only customers in GTE
territory in Southern California have had a choice of local toll
providers. Bay Area consumers have had to ``dial around'' Pac Bell
to get better rates.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's competitors have been eager to get into California's
local toll market, which is estimated to be worth $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone company and its competitors have spent several
years arguing over entry. Competitors said Pac Bell was unfairly
keeping them out, and Pac Bell said it was following the rules
spelled out in the Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell argued that it did not have to open the market to
competitors until the company was allowed to offer long-distance
service. So far, Pac Bell has been denied entry to that lucrative
market.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, state regulators ordered Pac Bell to open the local
toll market after the Federal Communications Commission issued a
similar ruling. Pac Bell asked the FCC to postpone the start date
to June 15 so it could prepare for the change but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a Pac Bell spokesman, said the company has spent
the past few weeks reprogramming 774 switches across the state and
training over 8,000 service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months, switching from Pac Bell to another
local toll provider will be free. After November 7, it will cost
$5.26 to make the change. However, some long-distance companies may
pick up that tab.

BUSH MEETS RELATIVES OF JASPER SLAYING VICTIM AS HATE CRIMES BILL
DEBATED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush met for the first time
Thursday with relatives of the Jasper man who was dragged to death
last year, assuring them he would take ``a serious look'' at the
hate crimes bill if the Senate passes it, but refusing to try to
sway senators on how to vote, the victim's family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, in so many words, that next to God he is the man
holding my dad's fate. And I said, `It's up to you if my dad died
in vain,''' said Francis Renee Mullins, the 28-year-old daughter of
James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he told me that no matter what the (outcome), my dad did
not die in vain,'' Mullins added. ``I think I moved him a little
bit, but not as much as I would have liked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins and her cousin, 27-year-old Darrell Verrett, met with
Bush for about 10 minutes in the governor's office, pleading with
him the importance of passage of the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes
Act. The measure, House Bill 938 by Rep. Senfronia Thompson,
D-Houston, passed the House last week but has met strong opposition
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor had offered to
meet with the Byrd family shortly after his murder but the family
had declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor told them (Thursday) that he was pleased that the
real murderer in the terrible, brutal murder received the death
penalty,'' McClellan added.
</P>
<P>
   One of three white men charged in the killing of Byrd, an
African-American, has been convicted. The two other men will be
tried later.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate Criminal Justice Committee took testimony
for more than four hours Thursday on the hate crimes bill, Sen.
Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who is carrying the bill in the Upper
Chamber, left the matter pending because he was one vote shy of
being able to move it to the Senate floor. He said he would try to
schedule a vote for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is made up of four Republicans and three
Democrats, and votes at this point are falling along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   And on the National Day of Prayer, Mullins _ breaking down in
tears as she described how her father died as his head and arm were
ripped from his body as it was dragged along a logging road _ told
the committee she was praying that they would vote the bill out of
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hanging on to the grace of God that you and your peers
will do what's right,'' Mullins said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston state Sen. John Whitmire, meanwhile, was so incensed by
the stalemate in the Senate committee that he was hoping to muster
votes from fellow Democrats to block all bills from floor debate
until the hate crimes bill is heard there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would be remiss if we didn't raise the stakes a
little,'' Whitmire said. ``I don't think you'd have to do it (block
all bills) but a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, though, that the support isn't there for that drastic
of a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic we will come up with the one additional vote
... but we need the governor, the lieutenant governor and the
speaker,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``as important as tax reform, but this does not have the
bully pulpit of the governor's office, but, hey, it's picking up
steam,'' Ellis added.
</P>
<P>
   As passed by the House, the bill would enhance penalties for
those convicted of crimes against a person because of the victim's
race, gender, sexual preference or any of seven other categories of
individuals. It would not, however, increase penalties for those
convicted of murder or capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   It also would allow victims of hate crimes to seek civil
remedies against their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents of the proposal contend that the current statute
is so vague it is unusable and likely unconstitutional. Indeed,
Ellis said, it has been used only twice since it was passed in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the bill would set up preferential
categories of victims, giving criminals tougher penalties for
attacking one of the protected group than for someone who is not in
a protected group.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis and other Democrats insist the real ``hot button
issue'' is its inclusion of gays and lesbians in the protected
categories.
</P>
<P>
   But at least, Ellis said, ``the debate this session has matured
to the point that even if it is their concern, they're too ashamed
to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown told the committee that the hate crimes
legislation is sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The James Byrd Hate Crimes Act is an important piece of
legislation ... because it will send a strong message to those who
commit crimes against an individual or group because of their
prejudice, bias or hatred,'' Brown said. ``The hate crimes bill
will assist in stopping a cycle of violence, a cycle that starts
with small maybe subtle acts of hatred but eventually builds into
cruel acts of bigotry as well as brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Cantu of the Family Research Group of Washington, D.C.,
said she believes that any bill or law that sets up distinctions
should not be passed, or should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will a man who rapes me because I'm a lesbian be convicted
differently than if he raped me because I'm 5-foot-4-inches,'' she
asked.
</P>

 Por BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ La humilde agua se convierte en la bebida mas
atractiva para las companias de bebidas que buscan crecer en
Mexico. En momentos que el mercado de los refrescos pierde su
efervescencia, el agua destapa posibilidades que hace cinco anos
apenas existian. ``El mercado del agua embotellada es tan grande
como el de los refrescos, y crece mas rapidamente,'' senala
Mauricio Vergara, responsable de la marca Ciel para Coca-Cola de
Mexico. ``Y queremos tener una presencia en ese mercado.''
 &HT;    Pepsi, Nestle y Danone aspiran a lo mismo. Las cuatro
multinacionales compiten por el primer lugar en un negocio valorado
en US$11.000 millones anuales. El mercado esta dividido en dos
grandes segmentos: el pequeno y de gran margen de ganancias (las
botellas de menos de dos litros) y los envases de 20 litros, que
representa el 90 por ciento de las ventas pero que no rinde tantas
ganancias. Hasta ahora, Danone y Pepsi-Gemex, la mayor
embotelladora de Pepsi en Mexico, tienen la delantera en los
mercados pequeno y grande, respectivamente, en una batalla que
promete ser mas renida que las famosas guerras de las colas.
 &HT;    El consumo de agua embotellada crecio el 12 por ciento el ano
pasado y hoy constituye el 18 por ciento de todos los liquidos que
toman los mexicanos, dice Vergara.
 &HT;    Hace unos dos anos, Coca-Cola lanzo la marca Ciel de envases
pequenos. Echando mano a su robusta publicidad y su gran base de
distribucion, Coca-Cola ha conseguido una participacion del 12 por
ciento en una feroz contienda con Bonafont, la marca lider en el
mercado, de Danone, y Santa Maria, de Nestle, que tienen el 15 por
ciento y el 13 por ciento respectivamente. Y Ciel ahora busca una
mayor porcion del mercado de los garrafones, donde la empresa
dominante es Pepsi-Gemex.
 &HT;    ``No quiero exagerar nuestra competencia con Gemex, porque nos
hemos concentrado en distintos segmentos del mercado del agua,''
dice Vergara. ``Pero ahora queremos mas, asi que nunca se sabe.''
 &HT;    Al mismo tiempo, Pepsi-Gemex apunta hacia una mayor
participacion del mercado de las botellas, contando con la ayuda de
su marca Electropura en la categoria de garrafones de 20 litros.
``Creemos que tenemos mucho que ofrecer a los clientes en el
segmento de los envases pequenos. Ellos conocen nuestra calidad y
nuestros precios son competitivos,'' apunta Irma Montemayor, a
cargo de la marca Electropura en Pepsi-Gemex. ``Y si Ciel entra en
el mercado de los garrafones, nada nos impide ganar una mayor
participacion en el mercado de los envases pequenos.''
 &HT;    De todas formas nadie ha olvidado a los refrescos carbonatados y
el segmento sigue creciendo. El consumo de productos de Coca-Cola
crecio el 6 por ciento el ano pasado, y el de Pepsi un poco mas.
Mexico es el segundo mercado de Coca-Cola a nivel mundial, despues
de EU, y tambien es un mercado clave para Pepsi, de modo que la
guerra no ha acabado.
 &HT;    Pero el agua embotellada esta de moda y el crecimiento de Ciel
alienta una renida competencia. Los anuncios de Danone presentan a
individuos atleticos que corren por bosques y hacen una pausa para
tomar agua Bonafont o Evian. Agua Santa Maria, de Nestle, muestra a
un sacerdote que dice a un grupo de jovenes que el agua que toma es
tan pura como la Madre de Dios.
 &HT;    Ambas campanas tienen el proposito de subrayar que el agua de
Bonafont y de Santa Maria es de manantial. Danone y Nestle tratan
de imprimirle a sus marcas un caracter mas distinguido que el del
agua purificada de llave de Ciel y Electropura.
 &HT;    ``Ciel cuenta con la fortaleza del mercadeo y la distribucion de
Coca-Cola, y ha crecido,'' comenta Hilda Paredes, portavoz de Agua
Santa Maria, que recoge su agua de un pozo de montana en el estado
de Puebla. ``Pero nuestro producto es distinto: es de un pozo
natural y la gente se da cuenta.''
 &HT;    Ademas del rechazo al agua de la llave, otra fuerza impulsa el
consumo de agua embotellada: un cambio cultural. El agua
embotellada se ha convertido en un simbolo de posicion para las
personas de entre 20 y 40 anos, mas conscientes de su salud.
``Beber agua embotellada forma parte de la nueva cultura que muchas
personas adoptan,'' dice Israel Garces Crespo, entrenador de un
gimnasio en la capital mexicana.
 &HT;    Con cuatro multinacionales lanzando distintas marcas de agua, es
muy probable que la nueva cultura eche raices.

<P>
   Used to be you followed your team until it was knocked out,
caught a few highlights from the later rounds and eventually tuned
in for the coronation. The playoffs were replete with fun and
flair, but ultimately the drama boiled down to whether the Chicago
Bulls would win in five games or six, whether Michael Jordan would
hit the game-winner with 1.2 seconds left or at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be Celtics, Lakers, Bulls; you knew who was going to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me they never felt like they had a
chance,'' said Heat coach Pat Riley, referring to the reign of the
Los Angeles Lakers. ``And I'm sure it was the same way in the
Eastern Conference when Boston was running the show.''
</P>
<P>
   As the National Basketball Association postseason opens
Saturday, six teams have a legitimate chance to win the
championship. And that's not counting the Houston Rockets or the
Lakers, who meet in the most compelling Western Conference
first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a dynasty has been broken up and the playing
field somewhat has been equaled, I do think everybody feels hungry
and feels they have a chance,'' Riley said. ``There's nothing
looming down there in the specter of a Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout-ruptured regular season is over. The payoff for all
those pulled hamstrings and 56-point eyesores begins Saturday when
Riley's Heat and the Knicks begin Act III of their basketball
morality play in Miami. Larry Bird's third-seeded Indiana Pacers,
maybe the East's best hope to win the post-Michael/Scottie crown,
play host to Milwaukee in Game 1 on Sunday. Also on Sunday, the
Orlando Magic will try to corral Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia
76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the veteran, savvy Utah Jazz is a lock. Karl Malone and
John Stockton may have to go through San Antonio to advance to the
finals for a third consecutive season. The Spurs and the Jazz
finished with identical 37-13 records, but Tim Duncan, David
Robinson and the Spurs won the home-court tie breaker, and a
remarkable 31 of their last 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   Portland may have peaked, but it still has enough rebounders and
young legs to match up well against either San Antonio or Utah.
Indicative of the parity, the Jazz opens against Sacramento, a
matchup that has presented three overtimes in three games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Jordan's retirement and the Bulls' disbanding may
not be the commercial downfall of the NBA after all. At least they
were nice enough to leave the league's other 28 teams with a nice
going-away present: a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody out there who scares you,'' said Avery Johnson,
the San Antonio point guard. ``You respect all the better teams,
but you don't fear them like maybe teams feared the Bulls in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the parity, Riley said: ``More so in the East. I do think
there are a few teams over there that have the experience and the
size. I mean, Utah has been there. They sort of remind me of what
happened in 1983 with Dr. J,'' he added, referring to
Philadelphia's breakthrough year for a title after so many years of
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that they weren't a great, great, great team,'' Riley
said, ``but it's like the heavyweight champion of the world. If the
next one in line has been there twice already, you're going to have
to really beat them. They have the experience and they're going to
be a tough handle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee and Philadelphia make their return to the playoffs for
the first time since 1991. Postseason neophytes like Iverson will
be forced to match up with veterans like Anfernee Hardaway for at
least a week. Glenn Robinson and Ray Allen make their postseason
debuts against the battle-tested Reggie Miller, Dale Davis, Chris
Mullin and Mark Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Old-school teams like the Jazz and Pacers have an inside track
on the title, but youth is about to be served early in the first
round. If it's not Jason Williams going by Stockton or Alonzo
Mourning dunking over Patrick Ewing, it may be Kobe Bryant and
Shaquille O'Neal helping usher Charles Barkley into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, meanwhile, continues his development into the league's
most valuable player. It may not happen this season, but as Malone
found out last Sunday in a Spurs victory, Duncan is closing in on
that designation. By the end of the conference finals, the
second-year center may have sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the first title of the post-Michael era will take more
than all-stars. San Antonio's Mario Elie, Utah's Bryon Russell,
Indiana's Jalen Rose, Miami's Terry Porter and Portland's Stacey
Augmon are the type of selfless contributors who can either knock
down a big shot or move their feet quick enough to pick up a key
offensive foul in the final minutes _ the kind of players that add
fire to this seat-of-the-pants season.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's 76ers could knock off Orlando in the first round. If
the eighth-seeded Knicks find a way to get past Miami for the
second straight season, they would meet the imminently beatable
Pistons or Hawks in the second round, and be on their way to their
first conference finals in five seasons. And no telling what
Bryant, O'Neal and Glen Rice can do if they keep jelling
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Wild. From a labor-pained season of mediocrity, a postseason of
intriguing possibility has emerged. Just thank Jordan and the Bulls
for their going-away present.

TV SPORTS: RIFT BETWEEN ESPN AND MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WAS
INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As ESPN's chief baseball analyst, Joe Morgan is rarely called
upon to analyze the corporate doings of his employer. But that
changed Tuesday when ESPN sued Major League Baseball in federal
court to block baseball's termination of the cable network's
regular-season deal after this season. Baseball has been irate for
16 months over ESPN's plan to shift three Sunday night games in
September to ESPN2 in favor of National Football League games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed that they haven't worked this out,''
Morgan said. ``But I can see both sides. Baseball is saying the NFL
is more important, but ESPN is saying it wants to do a good job for
baseball nd for the NFL. Since 1990, ESPN has done more for
baseball than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's point is correct. ESPN has stayed with baseball for 10
seasons, while CBS (1989-93), NBC and ABC (1994-95) and Fox and NBC
(1996 until now) have juggled the television contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four years ago, NBC and ABC stalked out of their
partnership deal with baseball when Major League Baseball would not
extend their package. NBC vowed a pox on baseball, but negotiated a
new contract later that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN has been there every day,'' Morgan said. ``The networks
are there once a week.'' Meanwhile, ESPN carries Sunday night
games, Wednesday night doubleheaders, opening day tripleheaders,
exhibitions like the Cuba-Baltimore Orioles game, playoffs and the
nightly ``Baseball Tonight'' studio program.
</P>
<P>
   However, ESPN did not give baseball warning of its plan to move
three September Sunday night games to ESPN2 if it acquired a
full-season package of NFL games. Of course, baseball could have
read the public tea leaves about ESPN's desire to add the first
half of the NFL season to the second half it had already carried.
But it never confronted ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN finally told baseball of its plans on Jan. 13, 1998, the
day it acquired the $600-million-a-year NFL package. ESPN's course
was inevitable: impolitic as it was to push an existing partner
around, it favored the higher-rated NFL because it cost 15 times
more for those rights than baseball's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone out of our way to apologize to them, but they still
feel offended,'' said Dick Glover, executive vice president of
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball seethed, insisting it would not approve moving the
three games to ESPN2 _ which has 64.5 million subscribers, from
ESPN, which has 76.6 million. Besides, baseball said, early-season
NFL games did not fit its definition of ``an event of significant
viewer interest,'' the contractual provision that ESPN insists
justifies replacing baseball with football.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, baseball angrily revoked ESPN's right to carry
the three Sunday night games, causing ESPN to lose one game
involving Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two weeks ago, baseball terminated its regular-season deal
with ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has reason to be steamed, believing its rights should
be considered ahead of football's, despite the NFL's better
ratings. But even if ESPN had told baseball of its plans in
advance, this impasse would have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   One also gets the sense there could be an ulterior motive to
baseball's actions. If baseball can shed the final three years of
its regular-season contract with ESPN, it can seek a better cable
deal from Fox Sports Net or Turner Sports. Baseball officials have
watched as rights for NFL, National Basketball Association and even
National Hockey League games have soared. Especially eye-opening is
the new four-year, $600 million NHL deal with ABC and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   If ESPN values the lower-rated hockey so highly, baseball seems
to reason, shouldn't they crave us even more?
</P>
<P>
   So baseball has spurned ESPN's entreaties to settle this mess;
according to ESPN's lawsuit, baseball said it would accept the
shifting of the three September games if ESPN paid what amounts to
a $350 million penalty through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN tried to woo baseball by augmenting ESPN2's viewership by
putting the games on local stations in the teams' markets; adding
up to eight Tuesday and Friday night games on ESPN with pennant
race implications and producing 6 to 10 two-hour installments of
``Baseball Tonight'' on ESPN in September.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't shabby offers, but evidently they are not enough to
erase the insult baseball feels. Yet when so much has gone right
between ESPN and baseball, why threaten that relationship with a
gross overreaction like terminating the contract?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forced to compete with increasingly wealthy universities while
making do on a tight post-Cold War defense budget, the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., is announcing Friday the
first major private fund-raising campaign in the history of the
service academies.
</P>
<P>
   West Point, which gets nearly all its money from the Defense
Department and gives full scholarships to every one of its 4,100
cadets, hopes to raise $150 million to endow professorships and to
pay for amenities like improved athletic buildings and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that West Point maintains itself as a
tier-one quality institution,'' said Lt. Gen. Daniel Christman,
West Point's superintendent. He said that while the budget has
remained roughly constant after inflation over many years,
competition for the most desirable students has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other tier-one schools we compete with are in the middle
of what I describe to alumni as a war with each other _ for
faculty, for modernization, for technology,'' he said. ``We felt we
could not go to Congress to ask for all of this. The reality _ and
I've been around the Army 34 years _ is that we have rarely seen
the fiscal constraints as tight as they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army pays basic operating costs of about $175 million a
year. But fund-raisers are quick to distinguish between ``core
needs'' _ like the classes, military training and barracks
essential for students working toward a bachelor's degree and
military commission _ and the extras that new money will pay for,
like internships, expanded student recruitment and stadium viewing
stands.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years of the quiet phase of the campaign, the period
during which an institution approaches its best donors before
announcing its campaign, West Point has already raised nearly $100
million, including 19 gifts of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the fund-raising effort, formally named the
Bicentennial Campaign because of West Point's 200th anniversary in
2002, is like any other university campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It has the requisite wealthy alumni as co-chairmen, in this case
Peter Dawkins (West Point '59), a Heisman Trophy winner and Rhodes
scholar who is vice chairman of Citigroup's Travelers Insurance
Co., and Dana Mead (West Point '57), a former White House fellow
and West Point professor who is now chairman and chief executive of
Tenneco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   And it has the requisite contribution from an Internet baron: $7
million from Jim Kimsey (West Point '62), who led the first company
of the 82nd Airborne into the Dominican Republic in 1965 and 20
years later founded America Online.
</P>
<P>
   But in critical ways, the campaign is unlike any other. For one
thing, federal employees are legally barred from asking for money
from private donors, so the campaign is being run by West Point's
alumni group, the Association of Graduates, with academy officials
playing a supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raisers must also be cautious about corporate donations.
Defense contractors would seem an obvious source of money, but
alumni association officials are wary that such contributions could
create a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been very careful _ and the defense contractors
have been very careful _ not to create a real or imagined quid pro
quo, though we're not eliminating anyone,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   All contributions must be reviewed by Army lawyers either at
West Point or in Washington, said Lt. Col. Michael Mahan, the
alumni association's vice president for development. ``It is
sometimes an impediment to fund raising,'' he added, ``but the
point is that there could be room for impropriety here and we have
to take the time and effort to make sure that there isn't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Six companies, including Rockwell International, Lucent
Technologies Microelectronics, and CAE Electronics, are on the
preliminary list of 71 ``leadership'' donors to the campaign. Mahan
said the biggest corporate gift so far is $1 million from MBNA
America for a military ethics center.
</P>
<P>
   The college must also be careful about how it attaches donor
names to campus facilities, a standard perquisite for large
contributors. ``As with most public schools, we are trying to come
up with tasteful naming opportunities,'' Christman said. ``But we
do not put them in the main cadet areas so we don't modify the
military ethos of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that West Point needs private money to supplement its
public budget surprised Christman when he signed on as
superintendent three years ago after serving as assistant to the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   West Point, like the other service academies, has routinely
accepted donations from its 45,000 alumni, but it had not
cultivated them in the systematic way that other leading
universities do. A good year meant about $5 million in donations,
except when the alumni were raising money for a project, like a new
alumni hall. Some private universities much larger than West Point
take in hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have sent out a mailing once a year and had a few
focused efforts to fund specific projects,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Other service academies are either contemplating or planning
similar campaigns. The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., said
recently that it intended to begin a campaign but had not announced
any specific goal of how much to raise. Richard Coppock, president
of the alumni association at the Air Force Academy in Colorado,
said Thursday that he expects it to do something similar.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   West Point officials and alumni spent about a year discussing
the possibility of a major fund-raising drive, how the money might
be used and how much to seek. But it took time to convince alumni
of the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys who have been to Vietnam feel, `Hey, I gave at the
office,''' Kimsey said. ``This really is a sea change for them.''
</P>
<P>
   William McGoldrick, a former college development officer whose
firm, Washburn &AMP; McGoldrick, was a consultant to West Point as it
planned its campaign, said that the alumni are as passionate about
their academy as those from colleges with the highest rates of
giving, like Dartmouth and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The unique experience of attending West Point, including the
first-year hazing program known as Beast Barracks, appears to have
created a loyal alumni corps. In interviews with West Point alumni,
McGoldrick said, many expressed strong affection for the
institution. He recalled one who said, ``Next to my wife, I love
nothing more than West Point.''
</P>
<P>
   McGoldrick was also not expecting so many of the alumni to be
wealthy. ``In hindsight, we shouldn't have been surprised,'' he
said, noting that while many West Point graduates stay in the
military for 20 years or more, many others leave for careers in
business. (In exchange for their free education, graduates must
spend five years on active duty and three years in reserve.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 52 individuals we interviewed, a third were chief
executives, chief operating officers or chief financial officers at
major U.S. corporations,'' McGoldrick said.
</P>
<P>
   As in most college fund-raising, donors are giving money to
projects that appeal to them. Mead, who holds a Ph.D. in political
science and economics from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said he was paying for four ``Mead scholars'' to work
each summer in organizations like NATO, the United Nations or the
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins, who was captain of cadets, senior class president and
captain of the football team, is contributing $1 million toward a
``vastly improved strength development center'' for exercising.
</P>
<P>
   ``A steel bar and two coffee cans filled with cement is where I
began,'' he said. But in his view, the academy needs the latest
equipment, especially if it is to compete against heavily endowed
football powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   He and others contend that such extras are important to lure the
strongest students possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us feel in our bones that the world is not going to
get any less dangerous, and is not going to be any less in need of
good leadership for the Army,'' Dawkins said. ``So we should
literally leave no stone unturned in trying to provide the very
best.''

NBC MINESERIES FOLLOWS THE TRAIL OF A KILLER FUGITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any memories of Kevin Anderson as the kindly Father Ray of
``Nothing Sacred'' will vanish upon viewing ``The Hunt for the
Unicorn Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a well-made NBC miniseries that's as good as ``Noah's Ark''
was bad, Anderson is outstanding as the consummate slimeball _ a
brilliant, manipulative narcissist who seduces women with his
``I's.'' Indeed, one reason why this film spans Sunday and Monday
nights is that Ira Einhorn's ego surely couldn't have been
contained in one evening.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn is the wily fugitive you may have read about over the
years. In the '60s and '70s, he was a prominent anti-war and civil
rights activist in Philadelphia. His Svengali-like personality
attracted many disciples,
</P>
<P>
   some of them wealthy and prominent. He used these connections in
1977 to jump bail after being charged with the murder of his
girlfriend, Holly Maddux. A Philadelphia jury convicted him in
absentia, but even though a diligent investigator traced him to
Ireland, then Sweden and finally France, Einhorn is not in jail
today. A French court initially refused to send him back, then said
he could be returned only if he were retried. Pennsylvania has
enacted legislation allowing a new trial, but Einhorn is appealing
the French ruling and remains a free man, 22 years after Maddux's
body was found stuffed in a steamer trunk in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn says he was framed by the CIA. ``The Hunt for the
Unicorn Killer'' makes note of this defense, but the film's
position is unmistakable: Ira Einhorn is a killer, he has been
convicted in a court of law, and he deserves to pay dearly for
murdering Holly Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by strong evidence, including the testimony of
acquaintances and Einhorn's own journals, Anderson studiously
creates a classic villain: intelligent and charming, scheming and
mean.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Maddux, a Bryn Mawr graduate from Tyler, Texas, fell in
love with the intelligent/charming side. It was the start of a
relationship she tried to end more than once, but to which she
always returned. Except the last time Maddux said she was leaving,
she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's father, Fred, suspected Einhorn from the start, but
Philadelphia police were reluctant to investigate a celebrity. Only
after a private investigator pieced together enough evidence to
implicate Einhorn did police join the case and ultimately find
Maddux's body _ 18 months after her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It's every father's nightmare, and Tom Skerritt effectively
conveys the anguish, uncertainty, confusion and dread that dogged
Fred Maddux for years. ``My job was to protect her,'' he says in
the film, quietly convincing himself that he failed as a father.
It's a dramatic demonstration of how much Einhorn had insinuated
himself into other people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one was more affected than Holly Maddux, who died
from a horrible beating. Australian actress Naomi Watts gives a
delicate performance, subtly finding the strength and vulnerability
of the impressionable young woman. Laurels, too, to Kellie Overbey,
who plays Meg, one of three Maddux sisters who continue the
campaign to bring the Unicorn _ Einhorn is German for ``one horn''
_ back home for a little ego reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer. Four-hour miniseries about the
true story of fugitive Ira Einhorn. Starring Kevin Anderson, Tom
Skerritt and Naomi Watts. Sunday and Monday on NBC. Parental
guideline rating: TV-14.
</P>

   Grade: B+

SENATE VOTES TO DROP BARRIERS AMONG NATION'S FINANCIAL INDUSTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, S.C., Ala., S.D.)  (js) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved legislation Thursday night that
would overhaul the nation's financial system, removing barriers
largely created during the Depression that have limited the ability
of banks, insurance companies and securities firms to expand into
one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   By a 54-44 vote along party lines, the Senate adopted a measure
sought by the three industries and written by Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas and chairman of the banking committee. It would repeal the
core provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and later laws
that industry executives say have made it increasingly difficult to
compete with foreign conglomerates unhindered by similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the Senate legislation,
and his aides have expressed a decided preference for most of the
provisions in a competing version that has been moving quickly
through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators will await action in the House, where banking
legislation with broad bipartisan support has been approved by the
banking committee there, and could be considered by the full
chamber soon. Last year, the House adopted comprehensive banking
legislation by the narrowest of margins, only to see it die in the
Senate when it was blocked by Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the president would veto the Senate
version because it would dilute requirements that banks make loans
to minorities, farmers and others who have had little access to
credit. The legislation also contains provisions that have been
criticized by Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin because
they reduce his department's oversight of banks.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, some Democrats and administration officials say
that Clinton might agree to legislation if the objectionable
provisions in the Senate measure were watered down or eliminated
when the House and Senate negotiate a final bill in conference. The
only Democrat voting for the bill on Thursday was Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved has been hailed by big banks, insurers
and Wall Street investment houses as a monumental step forward
because it deregulates the financial services industry for the
first time in more than 60 years. Consumer groups and civil rights
organizations have called it a giant step backward, rolling back
protective measures adopted in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure was sharply criticized Thursday evening by
the nation's top securities regulator, Arthur Levitt, the chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who said it would
undermine significant protection now afforded to investors. Levitt
said the legislation posed ``a real danger to investors'' because
it violated ``the principle of functional _ I call it `consistent'
_ regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a giant turf battle that in my opinion jeopardizes
investor protection,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But some Wall Street executives strongly praised the legislation
and said it demonstrated how the leadership abilities of Gramm had
been underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Chairman Gramm achieved passage of this bill by holding
to his ambitious schedule and not giving in on key issues bodes
well for ultimate passage of modernization legislation,'' said Mark
C. Brickell, a managing director of J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm called his bill ``a major step toward changing the
fundamental structure of financial services in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will greatly increase the kinds of services being offered
to Americans,'' he told reporters during the final vote. ``We have
assured those services will not only be available, but will also be
cheaper.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation would remove many obstacles now imposed on
banks, insurance companies and securities houses, it would also
reduce the role of the Treasury over new financial conglomerates
and drastically scale back a 22-year-old law, the Community
Reinvestment Act, that has encouraged billions of dollars in
lending to inner cities, farmers and others.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades, legislation to help modernize the
banking system has had a perils-of-Pauline sort of story line,
occasionally passing one chamber, only to fail in another, often
because of the competing lobbying by the three powerful industries
and struggles over authority among regulators.
</P>
<P>
   While important policy issues remain to be resolved between
Congress and the White House, many lobbyists predict that this will
be the session when the lawmakers finally pass a more widely
acceptable bill. Industries that have had many differences over the
shape of the legislation are now largely in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry groups have come out either supporting the bill
or are neutral,'' said Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the
American Bankers Association. ``We have been lobbying jointly with
the insurance industry and the securities industry, often holding
joint strategy sessions. That is really amazing, considering where
we were a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the agreements have come because of legal loopholes and
regulatory decisions that have punched wide gaps in the existing
legal restrictions. Momentum for a new law has also grown as more
financial conglomerates offer diversified services, from bank
accounts to insurance, at separate affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the huge amount of money being raised by the
interest groups for political campaigns has created a dynamic where
no lawmaker wants to look like a spoiler. And the fact that the
Senate and the House are moving so early in the legislative session
suggests that compromises on the remaining disagreements can be
reached in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with no sign that either Gramm or Democrats in the House
or the administration will back down, the legislation could stall
at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage came after the White House, which has repeatedly
been losing votes on the legislation, lost another vote Thursday
that had threatened to derail the bill. The Senate voted 53-46 to
table an amendment endorsed by the White House and proposed by Sen.
Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., and by the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, that would have restored greater authority
to the Treasury to regulate financial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelby-Daschle amendment, which mirrored a provision in
legislation that was passed by the House banking committee, would
have permitted the new conglomerates created by the legislation to
operate securities underwriting and merchant banking units as
subsidiaries within the banks rather than as separate institutions
under the umbrella of a bank holding company.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it would have given a greater regulatory role to the
Treasury, which now regulates banks with national charters, and
would ultimately diminish the authority of the Federal Reserve,
which has lobbied fiercely against the provision.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelby-Daschle provision was at the center of a major policy
debate and struggle for authority between Rubin and Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has testified that the provision is essential because
Treasury must have a regulatory role in order to formulate economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has responded that by putting securities underwriting
and merchant banking within a bank, large financial conglomerates
would gain an unfair subsidy by having access to deposit insurance
and the Federal clearinghouse system.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing Greenspan's argument on Thursday, Gramm said that the
Shelby-Daschle provision would politicize monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want a president to have the ability to use
banking policy as a political tool?'' he asked rhetorically.
Transferring such authority to the administration, he asserted,
``would be a disaster for America.''
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of many big banks and securities firms,
Greenspan has also said that it would be better to have no bill
than to have one that would permit banks to use operating
subsidiaries to sell insurance and securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote also followed the adoption of several other
amendments. The senators voted to create a law making it a crime
for private investigators to call banks and pose as customers they
are trying to investigate in order to get information about their
accounts. They also approved a provision that would require all
banks to post a schedule of fees at their automated teller
machines.

SENATE PANEL FINDS U.S. MISTAKES LED TO CHINA IMPROVING MISSILE
FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate investigators have concluded that lax
monitoring of the launching of American satellites in China and
shortfalls in U. S. intelligence assessments contributed to
Beijing's enhancing its ballistic missile fleet using American
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have also found that China sought to influence
the 1996 elections in the United States but say it is unclear
whether specific political donations known to have been made by
Chinese officials were a part of that overall plan.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were included in a 45-page unclassified report that
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued Thursday night.
The report was approved with virtual unanimity by the 17-member
committee. Only Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., dissented, committee aides
said, for reasons that could not be learned Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   China's ballistic missile advances and its efforts to influence
the 1996 elections were addressed in separate sections of the
committee's report. This was done, committee aides said, at the
insistence of an influential Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan,
to underscore that no link between the two matters had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not address recent news accounts of China's theft
of some of this country's most sensitive nuclear secrets. Those
accounts surfaced largely after the committee had completed its
formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the report have the scope or detail of a still
classified report compiled by a special House investigative
committee on technology transfers to China.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it focused on the impact to U.S. national security of
the launching of American satellites in China, and on China's
efforts to influence the elections three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the committee's conclusions affirmed findings by
American military and intelligence analysts, among them that
national security had been harmed by the satellite launchings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee concludes that the technical information
transferred during satellite launch campaigns'' has enabled China
``to improve its present and future space launch vehicles and
ICBM's,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel focused on two instances in particular where sensitive
information was divulged to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   One case involved information that the Hughes Electronics Corp.,
a General Motors subsidiary, and Loral Space and Communications
shared with Chinese engineers after a failed launching of a Loral
satellite in February 1996. The other instance involved information
that Hughes shared with Chinese officials after the failed
launching of a Hughes satellite in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   These transfers of information came at a time, investigators
said, when China was aggressively trying to obtain sensitive
military technology. Although American intelligence analysts filed
reports at the time describing this Beijing priority, the committee
found that intelligence warnings had not highlighted the risk to
national security associated with specific technology exports.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found no evidence that China had yet incorporated
what it learned into its long-range nuclear missile fleet, and
acknowledged that China had improved its missile program more with
help from other countries than from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the panel offered several recommendations to
strengthen the monitoring of the launching of American satellites
in China, including detailed reports by the Pentagon to Congress
and pay increases for American monitors of those launchings.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also recommended that senior American intelligence
officials be closely consulted during the process of export
licensing of commercial satellites. In addition, Congress should be
notified when satellite companies are under suspicion of violating
export laws, the senators said.
</P>
<P>
   One major change already enacted into law at Congress'
insistence is the shift in control of American satellite exporting,
back to the State Department from the Commerce Department. The
Clinton administration transferred jurisdiction to the Commerce
Department in 1996, and the department was later accused of putting
commercial interests ahead of national security.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy,
said Thursday night that the administration concurred with most of
the committee's recommendations regarding satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   As for China's efforts to influence American elections in 1996 _
the subject of extensive hearings by House and Senate committees in
1997 _ the investigators found that the focus of China's plan was
the Congress, although there was no evidence of any attempt to
influence a specific lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In this part of the report, investigators noted that Johnny
Chung, a Democratic fund-raiser, had told them that he had been
given $300,000 by a senior Chinese official to help President
Clinton's re-election campaign. But, the report said, the FBI has
been able to trace only $20,000 of that sum to the Democratic
National Committee, from a contribution by Chung. Most of the rest,
the report says, went to Chung's personal use.

SLIDE TAKES OUT KNOBLAUCH, BUT NOT FOR THE YEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Chuck Knoblauch limped slowly into the Yankees'
clubhouse late Thursday afternoon, like a miracle at a religious
revival. His teammates, who had expected Knoblauch to be rolled,
carried or pushed to his locker with his left leg in a cast or
splint, gawked in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you're walking,'' said Scott Brosius, grinning in
amazement, for he and the others had witnessed the frightening
collision initiated by the Minnesota rookie Corey Koskie and
expected the worst after seeing Knoblauch writhing on the ground in
agony near second base. If Knoblauch, hitting .333 as the leadoff
batter, had been lost for the year, none of them would have been
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch may miss only a few days or maybe a little longer
with a severely bruised lower left leg _ ``I was very lucky,'' he
said _ and the Yankees finished their 10-game road trip happily,
pleased about their 6-4 record. Given the hard humor of
ballplayers, a few of them may have even thanked Knoblauch for
sacrificing his body on the play that proved pivotal to their 4-3,
10-inning victory over the Twins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (18-9) returned to New York and will begin a
nine-game homestand on Friday against the Seattle Mariners. Hideki
Irabu is scheduled to start against the Mariners' Mac Suzuki in
what is believed to be the first major league match-up between
pitchers of Japanese descent. Luis Sojo will most likely start at
second base for the Yankees in place of Knoblauch, who will undergo
further evaluation Friday and may or may not be placed on the
15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch will gladly suffer the pain and the time lost,
considering what might have been after the frightening play in the
eighth inning. The Yankees and Twins were tied, 3-3. David Cone
allowed three runs in the first inning and gamely battled through
the middle innings, throwing 115 pitches in the first seven
innings. When the Yankees tied the game in the top of the eighth on
Brosius' two-out run-scoring triple, Cone asked to pitch the bottom
of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone walked Brent Gates, and with one out, allowed a
ground-ball single to Terry Steinbach, Gates taking third. Cone
walked Koskie to load the bases, prompting Don Zimmer, the Yankees'
interim manager, to insert the sinkerballer Jason Grimsley, hoping
he might prompt pinch-hitter Ron Coomer to hit the ball on the
ground and get a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer obliged, hitting a chopper toward shortstop Derek Jeter.
Jeter thought the ball was hit too slowly to turn a double play, so
he decided to flip to second base quickly for a force on Koskie and
get one sure out. Gates raced home with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, however, still wanted to try a double play. With his
left foot on the base, his right foot on the dirt to the left-field
side of the bag, and Koskie bearing down on him, Knoblauch received
Jeter's throw and intended to pivot and fire to first. Willie
Randolph, a former second baseman and now the Yankees' infield
coach, watched Knoblauch plant himself for the throw and cringed.
``Get out of there,'' Randolph said to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's body began turning so that he could throw to first,
and he was facing third base when Koskie, 6 feet 3 inches and 217
pounds and intent on destroying any chance for a double play,
launched himself at Knoblauch. Without touching the ground, he
crashed into the side of Knoblauch's left leg. From third base,
Brosius saw Knoblauch's knee and leg fold in a way the body is not
supposed to bend, and he was sure Knoblauch was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch went down and immediately tried to rise. He is
accustomed to pain: he usually ranks among the league leaders in
getting hit by pitches, and almost never moves, often taking
fastballs off his ribs and left arm without flinching.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch could not shrug off this injury. He rolled on the
dirt and grimaced, eyes closed, and he could hear the shouting of
the second-base umpire, Jim Joyce. Joyce dramatically pointed at
Koskie, saying he had gone over the bag to hit Knoblauch and
interfered with his attempt at a double play. Coomer was called
out, ending the rally without any runs, and later, Twins Manager
Tom Kelly said Joyce's ruling was ``the right call, no question
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was carried off the field, leaning on the shoulders of
teammates, and he said to others in the dugout that his left foot
was numb. Unlike his teammates watching silently as trainers tended
to him, Knoblauch already figured his knee was all right. ``I could
bend it,'' he said. But Knoblauch was not sure if his leg was
broken, and he was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went about the business of winning the game. Bernie
Williams led off the 10th inning with a single to left, stole
second, and with one out, Ricky Ledee _ batting .162 _ fell behind
in the count to Rick Aguilera, no balls and two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again,'' Ledee thought, but he punched a line drive
to left field and Williams scored the decisive run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees returned to their clubhouse, already certain
Knoblauch was hurt and would be sidelined extensively. ``It's very
unfortunate for us,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``From the looks of
it, we're not going to have him for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   From Girardi to Zimmer to Cone to Brosius to Randolph, they said
Koskie's play was reckless, not dirty, a result of rookie
exuberance and inexperience that is understandable and
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you see your
second baseman get roll-blocked and hurt,'' Cone said. ``He's a
young player and I'm sure he's just trying to play the game hard,
but you can't roll-block that late when the second baseman is in a
vulnerable position. His career is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskie, who knew Knoblauch _ a former Twin _ and chatted with
him on Tuesday and Wednesday, went to Kelly immediately after the
game and apologized for the play, and Kelly called Zimmer to check
on Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, doctors X-rayed Knoblauch's leg and found no
fractures; same with his ankle. Knoblauch's leg was wrapped and,
still wearing his baseball pants and T-shirt, he limped gingerly
into the clubhouse, much to the stunned relief of teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he was just trying to play the game hard,'' Knoblauch
said, cheerfully. ``I can deal with these bruises, and I'll get
back out there as soon as I can.'' &QL;

COURT CALLS LIMITS ON DATA-SCRAMBLING SOFTWARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. government's restrictions on the export of
data-scrambling software are unconstitutional, a federal appeals
court in California ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco affirmed a lower court ruling in
the case of an Illinois mathematics professor who had sought to
distribute information about encryption on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three judges concluded that the federal export
regulations ``operate as a prepublication licensing scheme that
burdens scientific expression'' and thus were a prohibited form of
prior restraint under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The government has long argued that encryption software used to
scramble messages is a ``munition.'' Indeed, military history is
rife with examples of battles that have turned on intercepted
messages.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many businesses and computer software companies
have lobbied the government to relax those regulations, arguing
that protection of sensitive financial and other private data is
essential to growth of Internet commerce. Moreover, they have
argued that because encryption software is common overseas, the
laws merely prevent American companies from competing.
</P>
<P>
   The case began when Daniel Bernstein, who now teaches
mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was a
doctoral student at the University of California at Berkeley.
Bernstein developed an encryption program he called Snuffle and
wanted to publish it for review.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernstein was denied an export license by the Commerce
Department, he sued with the backing of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a civil liberties group.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision, written by Judge Betty B. Fletcher and
joined by Judge Myron H. Bright, found that the regulations vested
``boundless discretion in government officials.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Supreme Court has held that prior restraint, or
blocking something from being published, is legal only in extreme
cases. Thursday's opinion said that the Commerce Department's
license requirements for exporting encryption software ``run the
twin risks of encouraging self-censorship and concealing
illegitimate abuses of censorial power.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge T.G. Nelson argued that
distributing encryption software was a form of conduct, not speech,
and thus could be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher and Bright disagreed, stating, ``The source code at
issue here is text intended for human understanding, albeit in a
specialized language.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Department of Justice, which brought the case, and the
Department of Commerce declined to comment until they had reviewed
the decision.

A NET DIFFERENCE IN GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You wouldn't know it from looking at her stats,
but UCLA goalie Erin Golaboski hates her position. Not so USC
keeper Bernice Orwig.
</P>
<P>
   For each of Golaboski's 186 saves and 4.6 goals-allowed average,
she would trade it for playing in the field, maybe as a two-meter
or driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to play in the goal as a kid, but now she can't stand
it,'' UCLA interim water polo coach Adam Krikorian said.
</P>
<P>
   Orwig thrives in goal, making 212 saves and earning her
conference's Player of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths have crossed several times this season, with USC and
Orwig thriving each time. They might meet again this weekend in the
NCAA women's national tournament in Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The roles have switched. UCLA (21-9), which has won the past
three titles, finds itself seeded fourth. The Bruins begin today at
10:45 a.m. against 13th-seeded Maryland. USC (26-2) is No.1 after
never finishing better than fifth.The Trojans meet No.16 Indiana at
9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterfinals are later today (USC would face either UC
Santa Barbara or San Jose State at 3 p.m., UCLA would get Hawaii or
UC San Diego at 5:30). The two could meet in Saturday's semifinal
at 5:15 p.m., with the winner advancing to Sunday's national
championship game at 3:30 p.m. Stanford and Cal are seeded second
and third.
</P>
<P>
   Both goalies have national tournament experience, but Golaboski
played in the field last year and scored 65 goals, second-best on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played goalie in high school (in Maryland), and I was
recruited to play goal,'' Golaboski said. ``But they didn't need
me, so I played in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't needed because UCLA had All-American Nicolle Payne.
Payne graduated, so Krikorian asked Golaboski to return.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``ask'' isn't the right word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I didn't have a choice,'' Golaboski said, ``so I
worked at it and got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwig comes to play every day (she has 80 saves in her previous
national tournaments) and has watched the Trojans attitude change
of late. The players respond differently to coach Jovan Vavic's
shouting. They're practicing harder, she said, because the main
goal is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice hard because we want to,'' she said, ``not because
Jovan was yelling at us. In meetings, Jovan asks a question and
everyone knows the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the team's role has switched to favorite, Orwig doesn't
think the pressure will overwhelm the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me more confidence,'' she said. ``Everyone has a
greater sense of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?: Traditionally, the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation volleyball runner-up receives the at-large berth into
the NCAA Final Four, which began Thursday and concludes Saturday.
This season, USC was passed over in favor of Long Beach State, a
team the Trojans beat in the first round of the MPSF tournament. It
made sense, since Long Beach had beaten USC three times this season
and the 49ers are ranked higher.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the runner-up didn't receive the NCAA at-large
berth was 1990. UCLA finished second but USC got the berth and went
on to win its fourth national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Roumain repeats: Pepperdine volleyball player George Roumain
repeated as the American Volleyball Coaches Association's Player of
the Year. The 6-foot-6 outside hitter is only the second player
(UCLA's Jeff Nygaard is the other) to be named national player of
the year twice.
</P>
<P>
   Roumain led the nation with an 8.55-kills-per-game average and
was third with 2.47 digs per game.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the All-America team were Highland graduate Ryan
Millar of BYU, who became one of only five players to earn
first-team honors three times; UCLA's Adam Naeve and Brandon
Taliaferro and Pepperdine's Scott Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine golf notes: The women qualified for the NCAA West
Regional Championships for the first time and will be one of 20
teams competing at the Pine Forest Country Club in Houston this
weekend. The top 11 teams and two individuals will advance to the
NCAA Championships, May 19-22, in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Tamie Durdin leads the Waves with a 74.71 stroke
average.
</P>
<P>
   The men finish the regular season with this weekend's
Stanford-U.S. Intercollegiate. Freshmen Michael Beard leads wit a
73.28 stroke average.
</P>
<P>
   On the tennis court: The UCLA men earned the No. 1 seed for the
NCAA championships that begin May 14. The Bruins (21-2) will host
Western Michigan. Also playing at UCLA are Tulsa and San Diego
State.
</P>
<P>
   USC is seeded 12th and will face Missouri-Kansas City in Fresno.
Fresno State and Nevada-Las Vegas complete the bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's men also made the tournament and will play New
Mexico in Tempe, Ariz. Fourteenth-seeded Arizona State is the host
and will play Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   The final four rounds are May 20-23 at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, UCLA, Pepperdine and USC earned the eighth,
ninth and 10th seeds and will play at home. UCLA gets Western
Michigan (with South Alabama and Colorado), Pepperdine has Boston
University (with Lousiana State and Ohio State) and USC faces Drake
(with Minnesota and San Diego).
</P>
<P>
   The final four rounds are May 20-23 at Georgia.

AMERICO PAREDES, 83, PIONEER IN CHICANO STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By JOE HOLLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americo Paredes, a writer, folklorist and one of the founders of
the Chicano Studies movement in the 1960s, died May 5 at Specialty
Hospital in Austin, Texas. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death Paredes was professor emeritus of
English and anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin. His
best-known book, ``With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and
Its Hero,'' is considered by folklore scholars to be a
groundbreaking work in folklore and Chicano studies.
</P>
<P>
   Paredes was born in 1915, in Brownsville, Texas, to a family
with roots deep in what he called the Lower Border, that area of
Texas along the Rio Grande from the two Laredos to the river's
mouth at the Gulf of Mexico. Bounded by desert and the sea, this
isolated cluster of towns and villages along the river had been the
heart of the old Spanish province of Nuevo Santander, colonized in
1749 by Jose De Escandon. Paredes' family on his father's side came
to the area in 1580; his mother's family arrived in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Paredes insisted that a distinctive culture evolved where ``the
two cultures mingled and clashed,'' and he devoted his scholarly
life to exploring the folklore and culture of the area. His work,
the folklorist Richard Bauman has written, vindicates the premise
``that a deep, detailed, nuanced understanding of the local will
illuminate and inspire a more global vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He started writing poetry as a teen-ager and some of his poems
were published in La Prensa, a widely read Spanish-language
newspaper published in San Antonio. During the Depression years he
worked as a reporter for The Brownsville Herald. With his first
wife, Chelo Silva, a well-known singer in Mexico and South Texas,
he also was part of a group that performed traditional music for
parties and gatherings in the Rio Grande Valley. Paredes and Miss
Silva were divorced in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a reporter, Paredes wrote poetry and essays about
Chicano culture. He also wrote a novel, ``George Washington
Gomez,'' but the book remained in manuscript form until 1990, when
it was published by Arte Publico Press in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Paredes enlisted in the Army in 1941, and worked in the Pacific
theater as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. After the war, he
stayed in the Far East for five years, covering Japanese war crimes
trials for Stars and Stripes and later doing public relations work
for the American Red Cross in Japan. In Tokyo, in 1948, he married
Amelia Nagamine, daughter of an Argentine diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Texas in 1950 and enrolled at the University of
Texas at Austin. The first Mexican-American ever to receive a Ph.D.
at the University of Texas, he taught at the university from 1958
until his retirement in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``With His Pistol in His Hand,'' his doctoral dissertation, is
both a scholarly investigation into the evolution of a popular
ballad about a Mexican-American fugitive named Gregorio Cortes and
a revisionist retelling of the 1901 incident that inspired the
ballad.
</P>
<P>
   It would not have been published, Paredes told The Texas
Observer, without the aid of two influential scholars at the
university, Robert Stephenson and Stith Thompson, who became
Paredes' champions on a campus that had never been particularly
welcoming to Mexican-American students or scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published in 1958 and for nearly a decade after its
publication remained something of an underground classic. That
began to change in the 1960s, when Chicano activists at Berkeley
and other California institutions discovered it. They recognized
its significance as an alternative telling of American history and
sociology. Today, ``With a Pistol in His Hand'' is in its ninth
printing.
</P>
<P>
   Paredes, who was co-founder and first director of the University
of Texas Mexican American Studies program as well as a founder of
the Center for Intercultural Studies of Folklore and
Ethnomusicology, published numerous articles, essays, books and
poetry during his nearly 30-year career at the University of Texas.
He published five books after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``With His Pistol in His Hand'' and the novel
``George Washington Gomez,'' Paredes' books include ``Folktales of
Mexico'' (1970), ``A Texas-Mexican Cancionero'' (1976), ``Between
Two Worlds,'' a book of poems (1991), ``Uncle Remus con Chile''
(1992), ``Folklore and Culture on the Texas-Mexican Border'' (1993)
and ``The Hammon and the Beans and Other Stories'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   Paredes won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1962 and received the
Charles Frankel Prize from the National Endowment for the
Humanities in 1989. In 1991, he was awarded the Aguila Azteca
(Aztec Eagle) medal, the highest honor given a foreigner by the
Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; three sons, Americo, Alan and
Vicente; and a daughter, Julia.

MEXICAN HEIR KEEPS REINS AT TELEVISA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The young heir who took over Televisa, Mexico's
largest television network, has survived family feuds and
management crises to finish refinancing his hold on the company
without yielding control outside his family.
</P>
<P>
   Months of rumors that Rupert Murdoch, the worldwide media
executive, who has been on a television shopping spree in the
United States and Europe, would buy in to the Mexican broadcaster,
were laid to rest for the time being Thursday. Grupo Televicentro,
the holding company that controls Televisa, announced that the
Mexican venture capital firm Sinca Inbursa had purchased a 24
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Inbursa is part of the empire of Carlos Slim Helu, one of the
wealthiest men in Latin America, who is also chairman of Telefonos
de Mexico, the telecommunications conglomerate. Slim agreed that
his investment in Televicentro would be placed in a neutral trust
fund that will always vote with the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Azcarraga Jean, 31, the chairman of Grupo Televisa SA,
retained 51 percent of the holding company while his first cousin
Alejandro Burillo increased his stake to 25 percent from 11
percent. That ensures Azcarraga's control over the huge media
concern created by his father, since Televicentro holds a
controlling stake of 26.5 percent of the voting shares of Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   In comments last week, Slim said he was not interested in
running Televisa, the largest media company in the Spanish-speaking
world. He called it ``an excellent company with very good
management'' which he regarded as a solid investment, and he said
Inbursa had made a favorable deal, as well. No details were
released on the price Slim paid. But analysts said it was probably
in the $100 million range.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa shares soared by nearly 14 percent on the stock market
here Thursday, in part reflecting Slim's reputation as a savvy
investor whose stock choices are widely emulated. In New York,
Televisa's American depository receipts rose $5, or 11.7 percent,
to $47.75.

TRADE ENVOYS AGAIN FAIL TO CHOOSE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ Negotiations over a new leader for the
World Trade Organization are likely to remain deadlocked until at
least next week, envoys to the group said Thursday, and there was
increasing speculation that neither of the two finalists would get
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The rising pessimism came after another meeting failed to make
progress toward a choice between the New Zealand and Thai
candidates for director- general of the trade organization, the
134-nation group that determines the rules and mediates disputes in
global commerce. It has been leaderless for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   With each day the deadlock persists, the possibility increases
that the organization will have to postpone a ministerial meeting
on Nov. 30 in Seattle, where it had been expected to begin
important talks on lowering remaining trade barriers in goods in
services.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between the supporters of Mike Moore, New Zealand's
former prime minister, and Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy
premier and commerce minister, has come to symbolize the
organization's difficulty in reaching agreements easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the members, should be ashamed of the spectacle,''
Mexico's trade envoy, Alejandro de la Pena, said after the failed
round of negotiations Thursday. He said the group had not learned
from the wrangling over the selection of its first
director-general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, whose four-year term
expired May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Envoys said they were unlikely to reconvene until late next
week, diminishing the chances of a breakthrough before then. Last
week, Moore was named as the candidate with the most likely chance
of getting consensus by the member nations. But Supachai's
supporters have insisted that the organization's governing body,
the general council, try to build a consensus around the Thai
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Repercussions from the standoff in Geneva have rippled out to
Asia, where Thailand's government has blamed the United States for
trying to derail Supachai.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who strongly back Moore, have made it clear that
they are against efforts to revive Supachai's chances.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadlock stretched on, diplomats began raising the idea
of scotching both candidates and starting over. ``I don't think
we're there yet,'' one European envoy said, ``but it is a real
possibility.''

BO DIDDLEY AGAIN FEELS LIKE A MAN AMONGST THIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the fans he has made and the awards he has won as one of
the pioneers of rock 'n' roll, Bo Diddley feels like a two-time
loser.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, it was unscrupulous lawyers, agents
and label executives that conned him out of money he was rightly
owed from the sales of his records.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's bootleggers, pirates and the Internet that are
depriving him of a better living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said about 30 years ago that these computers were going to
be the death of us,'' Diddley said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened from a nap, Diddley was admittedly cranky when he
picked up the phone at his home in Levy County, Fla. From there, he
launched into a laundry list of complaints about the music business
and American society in general. But there were flashes of humor,
too, as he acknowledged the absurdities inherent in a decades-long
music career.
</P>
<P>
   Diddley's last album, the Grammy-nominated ``A Man Amongst
Men,'' was released in 1996 on the Code Blue label, an Atlantic
Records subsidiary. The label has since folded, leaving Diddley
with...well, diddly.
</P>
<P>
   Fans tape his shows because his records are hard to find. Others
download his music for free on the Internet. And every once in a
while, he comes across a CD he knows nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just played a benefit show here in Levy County and a kid
came up to me with a CD he wanted autographed,'' Diddley said with
dismay. ``I asked him where he got it from. It turned out to be a
bootleg. Some label I'd never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Diddley, 71, said it is deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost out one time, got slapped in the face and kicked in the
butt and shoved aside. Never got the recognition I deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got these computers and all this garbage going on
with people downloading music for free, so I'm losing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his frustrations, Diddley will always be remembered for
his distinctive ``Bo Diddley beat,'' a chunky, syncopated rhythm
featured in many of his classic rock 'n' roll songs _ ``I'm a
Man,'' ``Diddy Wah Diddy,'' ``Diddley Daddy'' (a Chris Isaak
favorite), ``Crackin' Up,'' ``Before You Accuse Me'' (covered in
the 1990s by Eric Clapton), ``Sweet Little Rock 'n' Roller,'' ``Say
Man'' and ``Who Do You Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Diddley's career took off in the mid-'50s when he and Chuck
Berry joined Chess Records. In 1963, he toured Britain for the
first time and discovered that white artists were adopting his
style and making it pay. But within a couple of years, Diddley also
was selling lots of records in Britain, more than he was in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Diddley went to England to record ``The London
Bo Diddley Sessions.'' As the '70s drew to a close, The Clash
invited the rock veteran to open its British and American tours.
</P>
<P>
   Diddley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
1987. Recent honors include Lifetime Achievement Awards from the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (1998) and the
Rhythm and Blues Foundation (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Diddley said he is honored by the awards but otherwise
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful awards on the wall do not put money in your bank
account,'' he said. ``It does not make my pockets look like
footballs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi native said he makes enough from his live shows
to get by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in poverty. But I could use a couple or more bucks. It
would be so much better if I was paid for these recordings. I
should be a millionaire by now and workin'
</P>
<P>
   if I felt like it. But I gotta work because I have to. And
that's screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that grouses Diddley is the media's view of rock
'n' roll history. Diddley was incensed by a recent TV special that
portrayed Elvis Presley as the creator of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sick what they're feeding all these kids on
television,'' Diddley said. ``Elvis was great and he did a hell of
a thing. But he did not start rock 'n' roll and I'm tired of the
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Diddley travels with one guitar, a custom-built copy of the
box-shaped guitar he made famous in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to give people something for their money,'' he said.
``We don't run off the stage after 15 minutes like some
entertainers.''
</P>
<P>
   Diddley is currently without a record label. ``I'm not looking
for anybody, but if someone comes along with the right deal and
they really do what they promise they're going to do, sure I'm
interested,'' he said.

SENATE DEMOCRATS SURVEY UPHILL FIGHT  
 NATIONAL DEMOCRATS RESIST STATE INITIATIVES  
 CALIFORNIA DEVISES `OPEN' PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats have always figured that the fight to regain control
of the United States Senate would be all uphill in 2000, given that
Republicans came out of the 1998 election with a 55-45 edge. And
ever since three party stalwarts _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Richard Bryan of Nevada _
announced this year that they would not seek re-election, the hill
has seemed even steeper.
</P>
<P>
   The job of directing the Democratic comeback effort has fallen
to Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, who calculates that the committee
will have to raise at least $60 million for a credible comeback
effort. But Torricelli says, the party must recruit good
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he says the party must be willing in its candidate
search to take a look at ``progressive people, despite their
previous affiliation'' _ independents and fallen-away Republicans,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in Minnesota, where the Republican incumbent, Sen. Rod
Grams, has been considered vulnerable almost since the day he
narrowly won election in 1994, some top Democrats are encouraging
the state's widely popular auditor, Judy Dutcher, a Republican, to
switch parties and challenge Grams.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dutcher might well fit in as a Democrat, being a supporter
of abortion rights and gay rights and a friend of labor. But she
says she will wait a bit before deciding, in part, she adds,
because she also is being courted by the newly resurgent Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, where another Republican incumbent, James Jeffords,
also seems vulnerable because of a narrow victory in 1994,
Democrats are urging Rep. Bernard Sanders, the only Independent in
the House, to mount a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, one of the state's most popular politicians (he runs at
large because Vermont's population is so small), mostly casts his
lot with Democrats in House votes. So if he ran for the Senate, and
won, he could presumably remain an independent and Senate Democrats
could usually depend on getting his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Will he go for it?
</P>
<P>
   Top House Democrats have told him that if he remains in the
House _ he seems assured of re-election _ they would honor his
seniority and give him a subcommittee chairmanship should the party
regain control next year. But Senate Democrats have made similar
promises, leading their House counterparts to counter that the
House is considerably more likely to end up in Democratic hands in
2000 than the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   National Democrats Resist State Initiatives
</P>
<P>
   Still another state Democratic Party is at odds with the
Democratic National Committee over the scheduling of an event
leading up to next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   First, Oregon Democrats, then South Carolina Democrats,
squabbled with the committee over primary voting dates, leading the
committee to threaten sanctions if they did not toe the party line.
</P>
<P>
   Now come Massachusetts Democrats with a plan to hold a straw
poll at their state convention this month that will provide an
informal reading on how Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley are faring.
</P>
<P>
   As Gus Bickford, the executive director of the Massachusetts
Democratic State Committee, sees it, the poll, scheduled for May
15, will also ``add a little bit more spice to a convention that
might otherwise not have been as exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   But national party officials see such straw polls otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really don't prove anything,'' Peter Kauffman, a national
committee spokesman, argues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the committee has yet to threaten Massachusetts Democrats
with any punishment should the vote take place.
</P>
<P>
   The poll will certainly provide a bit of spice if Gore, already
faltering a bit in some other states, shows poorly and Bradley runs
better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no recent Massachusetts newspaper or television
polls that pitted Gore against Bradley in a theoretical primary.
But there are polls, one taken in late April, that show Gore with
much higher ``unfavorable'' ratings than Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Further, in recent Massachusetts newspaper and television polls,
as in polls in other states, Gore has been running well behind the
current Republican leader, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   California Devises `Open' Primary
</P>
<P>
   California officials believe they have finally found a way to
hold an ``open'' presidential primary next year as required by a
new state law and at the same time not violate long-standing
national party rules that forbid such primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is in still another new law, just signed by Gov.
Gray Davis:
</P>
<P>
   Next year's primary will be open as state law mandates _ that
is, voters may cross party lines, supporting whomever they choose
on the ballot, regardless of registration. The results will be
tallied and forwarded to party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballots will be coded so that separate tallies can be
kept in all instances in which Democrats vote Democratic,
Republicans vote Republican, and so forth. Those tallies will also
be forwarded to party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials, who helped legislators draw up the newly signed
law, plan to ignore the tallies resulting from the open voting.
While that tallying will satisfy the mandate resulting from a
recently passed citizens' ballot initiative, the parties are
confident that they can legally choose their own rules for counting
votes and thus are under no obligation to accept the open primary
results.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they say they intend to rely on the results from the
coded ballots to pick primary winners. If they do not follow that
carefully plotted course, they warn, the state's delegations to the
national nominating convention will almost certainly not be seated.

JONES QUESTIONABLE FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calf. _ Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder/forward Cobi
Jones missed practice Wednesday with an injured left big toe and is
questionable for Saturday's match at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Jones injured himself in the waning moments of Saturday's 1-0
shootout victory over New York/New Jersey at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's day-to-day at this point,'' Galaxy trainer Ivan Pierra
said. ``He's able to jog, but it's a little painful. It's one of
those situations where he could be fine in the next couple days, or
it could take as long as a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Time's up?: Ecuadorian midfielder Jaime Caidedo became the
Galaxy's fourth and final foreign allocation just before the start
of preseason training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old signed a six-month contract which ends later
this month. He was coveted by former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano,
but likely will be waived when his contract expires. He has not
played in any of the previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy assistant coach Ralph Perez said it is tough to keep a
foreign player if he is not contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look throughout the league, it's very important you
have four foreign players and that can be an asset,'' Perez said.
``Jaime's a great kid and he works hard, but that's not all you
need from your foreign player. Your foreign player is supposed to
bring an element that is missing or can add something. This year,
we've played seven games and we haven't started more than two
foreigners at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense wanted: Despite the Galaxy's four goals in seven games,
no one seems to be panicking or worrying about the team's 4-3
start.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy midfielder/defender Danny Pena says the goals will come,
but the Galaxy needs to get off to a quick start after the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, our defense created most of our offense,'' Pena
said. ``When we are creating opportunities early in the game, it
forces teams to come at us. When that happens, the game opens up
and we can counter and put more goals in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that hasn't happened this season.''

REESE WITHERSPOON GETS WINNING VOTE IN `ELECTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paramount has been very reluctant to release its
``Rushmore''-like high school comedy, ``Election'' _ possibly
because it's crude and adolescent in ways that could turn off a
mainstream audience (and in at least one way that probably should
have earned it an NC-17 rating).
</P>
<P>
   But after it opened to all favorable reviews in a tiny New York
release two weeks ago, the studio appears to have had a sudden
change of heart. And with little fanfare, it has held its breath
and tossed it into this weekend's release schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Jim McAlister (Matthew Broderick), the most
dedicated and popular teacher of Omaha's George Washington Carver
High, whose happy life goes straight to hell when his most annoying
student, Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), launches a campaign to
become student body president.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Tracy conniving, ruthlessly ambitious and sweet on
him, she also recently had an affair with Jim's best friend, who
lost his teaching job and almost went to prison as a consequence.
And if she wins, part of her job will involve working side-by-side
with Jim.
</P>
<P>
   So he inspires the school jock (Chris Klein) to run against her,
and the jock's lesbian sister (Jessica Campbell) also throws her
hat in the ring, and Jim becomes so determined that Tracy not win
the election that he begins a moral slide that snowballs out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Alexander Payne, whose first film was the so-so
1996 comedy, ``Citizen Ruth,'' it's often distastefully juvenile,
and has one scene in which a teacher gleefully describes a sex act
with an underage teenager that the MPAA rating board seems not to
have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's mostly funny. Broderick gives a wonderfully deadpan
and long-suffering performance, much of it is very cleverly written
and staged, and its off-beat structure (with narration from all
four principal characters) somehow gives a brilliant cross-section
of the particular horror that is high-school life.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``Election'' features a career-best performance
from Witherspoon. By wholeheartedly embracing a character who is
self-deluded, unattractive and totally unsympathetic, she steals
the movie and takes another big step toward becoming what she has
long threatened to be: the Gen X Bette Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Election. Directed by Alexander Payne. Screenplay by Payne &AMP; Jim
Taylor, from the novel by Tom Perrotta. Cast: Matthew Broderick,
Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein, Jessica Campbell. Paramount. 104
minutes. Rated R for sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

CALIFORNIA OFFICERS CLEARED IN KILLING OF YOUNG WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A county prosecutor said Thursday that four white
police officers in Riverside, Calif., who shot and killed a black
teen-ager as she sat apparently unconscious in a car with a gun in
her lap, had probably made an error in judgment, but had committed
no crime.
</P>
<P>
   In clearing the officers in the death of the woman, Tyisha
Miller, the Riverside County district attorney, Grover Trask, said
her death was ``a terrible, terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates and relatives of Ms. Miller have
protested the slaying, calling the officers murderers and the
incident the latest in a series of acts of police brutality across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ms. Miller's family and supporters, including the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, denounced Trask's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shameful day in America,'' said the Rev. Bernel
Butler, Ms. Miller's cousin and a spokesman for the family. ``I
served in Desert Storm, but this makes me almost ashamed to say I
served in the military. We go abroad to protect people, but we
don't protect our own people here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident began early Dec. 28, when the police were called to
a service station where Ms. Miller, 19, was slumped in her locked
car with a gun in her lap. The officers said that when they tried
to break a window to get her out of the car, she reached for the
gun. They then fired 23 shots into the car, striking her 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that all he and the family have wanted was that the
officers be made to answer to a judge and jury, ``like anyone else
who shot a defenseless girl 12 times while she sat unconscious in
her car.''
</P>
<P>
   The police began to back off from their original version of the
events soon after the shooting, and a deputy district attorney,
Mike Soccio, said Thursday that Ms. Miller's gun had not been
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Trask said at a crowded news conference that the officers had
been called to the service station at about 2 a.m. by Ms. Miller's
cousin, who said Ms. Miller was unconscious in her car with a gun
on her lap. The car had a flat tire and the cousin had come to
help. But when she arrived, she was unable to rouse Ms. Miller.
</P>
<P>
   When the police arrived, Trask said, they too tried to wake Ms.
Miller, banging on the car windows, shouting and shining
flashlights in her face.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, fearing that Ms. Miller was seriously ill,
the officers decided to break the window and grab the gun, Trask
said. The first try failed, but Ms. Miller suddenly sat up and
stared at her beeper, apparently unaware of her surroundings, he
said. Then officer Daniel Hotard, 23, a policeman for 11 months ,
broke the window and leaned inside to grab the gun.
</P>
<P>
   With his head inside, ``a shot went off towards my right ear,''
Hotard told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That shot came from a fellow officer, who thought he saw Ms.
Miller reach for a gun, Trask said. Hotard fell to the ground as
his three partners, Paul Bugar, 24; Wayne Stewart, 25, and Michael
Alagna, 27, continued firing. Hotard, still on the ground, fired
several rounds into the driver's side door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concluded,'' Trask said, ``that the plan to break out
the window was probably a mistake in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the officers had to weigh the risk of getting Ms. Miller
the medical attention she apparently needed with getting the gun
out of her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a judgment call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller had a small amount of alcohol in her system, but in
two autopsies, one commissioned by her family, there was nothing to
indicate any illness, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a civil rights advocate,
author and radio talk show host, said that an independent federal
prosecutor should be brought in to investigate. In the meantime a
rally and march to protest Trask's decision have been scheduled for
Monday.

REMAKE OF `THE WINSLOW BOY' FAILS TO BE A COMPELLING MORALITY
TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on the evidence of his past work, a new, G-rated film
version of Terence Rattigan's 1946 play, ``The Winslow Boy,'' would
seem just about the least likely project imaginable for Chicago
playwright-turned-filmmaker David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's very British. For another, it already has
been made into a successful film in 1948, directed by Anthony
Asquith, and starring Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Robert Donat. (And
wasn't it Mamet who once said that ``a remake of a good film is a
waste of everyone's time''?)
</P>
<P>
   Still, here it is, and despite some polished performances and
stronger production values than the original, it's not nearly as
good a film. And even though it follows Rattigan's play quite
closely, it fails to be a compelling morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1910 and based on a true incident, it's the story of the
Winslows: a recently retired London banker named Arthur (Nigel
Hawthorne) and his affluent, close-knit family, who get a nasty
surprise when his 12-year-old son is expelled from the Osbourne
Naval College _ accused of stealing a five-shilling postal order.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to six months later, and the case of ``The Winslow Boy'' is
suddenly an Edwardian media event. At great personal sacrifice, the
family has rallied around the accused, fought his expulsion and
gathered supporters who see the case as a symbol of an injustice at
the heart of the British legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film follows their fortunes as the case is taken
on by famed barrister Sir Robert Morton (Jeremy Northam), who also
believes in the boy's innocence and fights it in the halls of
Parliament, while becoming romantically attracted to the Winslow
daughter (Rebecca Pidgeon).
</P>
<P>
   It's a handsome production, and generally well-cast _ though
Hawthorne can't give the senior Winslow half the moral authority
that Hardwicke did; and Northam, while copying every gesture of
Donat's turn as Morton, doesn't have half that great screen actor's
star power.
</P>
<P>
   And Mamet makes some fatal mistakes, not the least of which is
skipping the dramatization of the family's series of rebuffs and
frustrations that dominated Asquith's first act, showing us why the
family came to devote itself so utterly to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, in which so much of the drama and action takes
place off screen or is merely implied in flashback references, it's
never clear what moral principle is involved, or why, 90 years
after the incident, we should be interested in it.
</P>
<P>
   The Winslow Boy. Directed and written by David Mamet, from the
play by Terence Rattigan. Produced by Sarah Green. Cast: Nigel
Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Rebecca Pidgeon, Gemma Jones. Sony
Pictures Classics. 110 minutes. Rated G, suitable for all
audiences.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL COMPUTER FAILURE CAUSES DELAYS AT THREE
AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An air traffic control computer on Long Island that
is the first of a new generation being installed nationwide failed
early Thursday, creating havoc at La Guardia, Newark and
Philadelphia Airports.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and seventy-four departing airplanes were delayed,
some for more than an hour, according to a Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman, who said that the number of incoming
planes delayed was unknown. Tens of thousands of travelers were
inconvenienced by the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The failure is another sign that the air traffic control system,
long plagued by breakdowns of frail, obsolete equipment, faces more
breakdowns with the installation of new hardware and software to
replace components that are either not compliant with year 2000
computer standards or are obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The computer system that failed had begun operation Feb. 24, and
its timely installation was hailed by the FAA as a sign of the
agency's increasing ability to modernize its equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers are replacing a model that is about 10 years
old, that is not year 2000 compliant and for which vital
replacement parts are not available.
</P>
<P>
   The problems Thursday apparently occurred when the new computer
was linked to a new type of display screen for the controllers. The
screens, which are being installed nationwide, have better
resolution than the old ones and can show more data.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Brown, an official with the union that represents FAA
electronics technicians, said the new system had not been
thoroughly checked before it was turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rushed this system into service, against our wishes,
because they want to say we've got another 40 percent of our
equipment Y2K compliant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who represents New York-area members of the Professional
Airways System Specialists, said the failure came as technicians
tried to connect the new computer to the new group of display
screens, which is part of another modernization project. The
switch, though, may have thrown more data at the new computer
system than it could handle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the new computer system failed Thursday at 6:25 a.m., the
old one automatically took over, but it, too, promptly
malfunctioned.

CHURCHILL DOWNS BUYS HOLLYWOOD PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In a development hailed by both companies as
good for Los Angeles horse racing, Hollywood Park was purchased by
Churchill Downs on Thursday, making the 61-year-old ``Track of the
Lakes and Flowers'' the western outpost in the Kentucky Derby
host's growing empire.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement _ the subject of negotiations made public a month
ago _ calls for Churchill Downs Inc. to pay $140 million for the
Hollywood Park racetrack and casino and most of the surrounding
real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The casino will be leased back to Hollywood Park Inc. for $3
million a year. Hollywood Park said it will sell or build on the
138 acres it retains of the 378-acre property next door to the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, expected to close in August, will mean the
departure of freewheeling Hollywood Park chairman R.D. Hubbard, who
seized control of the track in a 1991 proxy battle, replaced by the
button-down corporate style of Churchill Downs president and CEO
Thomas Meeker, a former Marine Corps officer.
</P>
<P>
   It will give Hollywood Park Inc. _ which is in for a name change
_ more money to pursue its shift from the racing business to the
casino business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested, in addition to (the purchase price), in
assuring that racing was going to continue and be viable here,''
Hubbard said a few hours after the agreement was signed at 6 a.m.
Thursday. ``And I can assure you that with Churchill Downs, that is
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely building the best racing company in the
country. There are going to be a lot of changes in racing in the
next century, and Churchill Downs is going to be leading the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Louisville, Ky., track is best known for the
Kentucky Derby's old-fashioned charm, its mission in the 1990s has
been to acquire other tracks to add to its simulcast wagering
network.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs operates the Hoosier Park harness track near
Indianapolis, and in the past year has purchased Kentucky's Ellis
Park and Miami's Calder Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   The catch phrase at Thursday's press conference was ``integrated
simulcast product,'' a fancy way to say one television program
presenting action from several racetracks, the kind of show that
proponents of in-home betting envision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can make it (simulcasting) markedly better,'' said
Meeker, who estimated the value of the national simulcasting market
at $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for racing. And I think it's going to be great
for Hollywood Park,'' Meeker said, promising, ``We are a racing
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeker said changes in the Inglewood facility are planned, but
wouldn't offer details.
</P>
<P>
   Interested observers said they were happy about the purchase,
which means both major L.A.-area thoroughbred tracks have new
owners, Santa Anita having been bought in December by Frank
Stronach's Magna International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churchill Downs is probably the best racetrack operator that's
interested in the future of racing,'' said John Van de Kamp,
president of Thoroughbred Owners of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great news,'' trainer Richard Mandella said of
the purchase. ``If Century 21 bought it, we'd be nervous. But
Churchill Downs has grandiose ideas and wants to take hold of the
racing market. I think it's great that Churchill Downs thinks
enough of Hollywood Park to make it part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, 63, said he told employees Thursday, ``It's time for a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas-born glass manufacturer who got into racing as an owner
and breeder, Hubbard stirred controversy early in his eight years
in charge of Hollywood Park, angering many horsemen by pushing
Friday-night racing, expanding simulcasting and opening the
trackside casino.
</P>
<P>
   But most acknowledge now that Hubbard revitalized Hollywood Park
after years of decay, and cited his role in the formation of the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association as a major contribution to
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Thoroughbred Owners of California) board expressed its
gratitude to R.D. Hubbard for the job he did here in trying to
break the mold of California racing,'' Van de Kamp said. ``I think
he kept it interesting, lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard said the failure of his attempt to build an NFL stadium
on Hollywood Park property did not contribute to his willingness to
sell. Smiling, he indicated he hasn't given up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have 140 acres we're interested in doing something
with,'' he said.

ROBINSON PLANS TO OVERCOME POSTSEASON FAILURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The NBA is a league full of labels and tattoos. Nobody
has to tell Clifford Robinson which of the two is easier to erase.
</P>
<P>
   The label is always there, no matter what Robinson does or
doesn't do.
</P>
<P>
   By appearance, at least, it looks to be even more permanent than
the portrayal of a warrior in a red-headband that is tattooed on
Robinson's right arm. The warrior is poised to strike. Robinson
likes to say that the tattoo represents the warrior within him.
</P>
<P>
   But from afar, it is impossible to see.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, there is only the label. And it says Robinson is
poised to fail.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to come under review at the eve of the NBA playoffs
every spring. The media arrives, waving cameras and tape recorders
like a surgical team with scalpels. Nothing about the intent is
cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been tagged with one of basketball's cruelest
combinations. His great accomplishments in regular-season are not
duplicated in the playoffs, the real season. The lion in winter is
the lamb in spring. That, at least, is the reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair, said Suns coach Danny Ainge, who Thursday expressed
exasperation at the way in which Robinson almost had become prey
for the media on the opening day of the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Knee-jerk reaction, said some of Robinson's teammates, whose
emphasis on jerk was neither misplaced nor mis-interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, himself?
</P>
<P>
   Been there. Done that.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the questions were coming. He dealt with them in a
reasonable, straight-forward fashion. He was fulfilling his end of
the business. It's part of being a pro, and, these days, Robinson
has been been every bit of that and more. After a decade in the
NBA, Robinson knows as well as any veteran that labels are always
misunderstood and seldom beaten. All he can do is try to help the
Suns beat the Portland Trail Blazers in a first-round playoff
series that opens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He is coming off one of his best regular-seasons, ever. Even he
has said as much. But there's an argument that the season is only
as good as his playoff performance. Does he need a great playoff
performance to validate all the exceptional performance that came
before it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Robinson, who says he is more weary than
frustrated by the repeated questions. ``I wouldn't say I have to
have an exceptional one (playoffs). I just think I have to continue
to play as well as I have all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have to go out carry us. I don't think I have
to do anything super. I just think I have to go out and maintain
what I've done all year.''
</P>
<P>
   If Robinson continues to play at the same level, some
prognosticators believe there's a good chance that the Suns can
upset the Blazers in the best-of-five series. From scouting report
to scouting report, there is consensus on at least one element:
Robinson is a key.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's first-round elimination of the Suns by the San
Antonio Spurs, Robinson drew a lot of the blame. On the balance
sheet, a comparison of his regular-season to playoff numbers is not
favorable. His scoring average fell to 6.3 points from 14.2. His
shooting percentage fell from a career-high .479 to .273.
</P>
<P>
   For his career, Robinson is averaging 15.9 points in regular
season and 10.1 in the playoffs. He's shotting 44.9 percent in
regular-season and 40.4 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ainge bristles at the suggestion that the numbers add up to
a playoff failure. That stats, he says, do not retell the story of
a series in which Rex Chapman and Danny Manning were sidelined by
injuries. The numbers, he says, do not explain the dilemma of
asking the 6-foot-10 Robinson to play center against David Robinson
and sometimes Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Clifford Robinson was asked to take the last stand
in the Alamo city, which is built on a monument to a final, futile
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliff was the best player in the only game we won,'' Ainge
said of the Spurs 3-1 victory. ``Nobody played well.''
</P>
<P>
   With center Luc Longley in the lineup this time around, Robinson
is able to play small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skills are more suited for small forward,'' said Ainge,
who expects Robinson will be matched by against Rasheed Wallace
through much of the Portland series. ``He's more comfortable at
that spot.''
</P>
<P>
   For Robinson, an irony in this series is his return to a city
where he played eight years. It's a place he still calls home. His
three children live in Portland. It's the site of his greatest
moments. He was an All-Star with the Blazers in 1994. He was the
NBA's Sixth Man of the Year in 1993. Yet, it is also a city with
the roots of his reputation for playoff futility. The Portland
``Oregonia''n's web site Thursday was filling up with knocks at
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   One Portland fan wrote that the Blazers best chance was a player
he still calls ``Uncle Cliffy.'' Another fan remembered a muffed
pass in an NBA Finals game against the Chicago Bulls. On and on, it
went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes in the playoffs always seem to be magnified,'' Suns
playmaker Jason Kidd said. ``It becomes a label, and it's hard to
shake. But I'm sure Clifford is looking forward to this series.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson almost makes it sound as though he's headed for a
reunion with some old friends who might be a little estranged these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my best years were in Portland,'' Robinson said.
``I've put those days behind me. The fans will say a lot of things.
I understand that. That's their prerogative. I'm just looking
forward to this series.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part, Robinson is because he says he understands _
enjoys _ basketball more than he ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a short series, and now is the time of year when you
can't concern yourself with individual gratification,'' Robinson
said. ``What is said is put out of my mind. I've had some great
things happen to me an individual player. But as I get older, I
enjoy the experience of having good things happen to the team at
large. It's part of growing up. In 10 years, you learn a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of it can't be found on a label. &QL;

FINLEY FINDS SUPPORT DURING SLUMP

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There are reasons to believe that Steve Finley will
not perform this poorly all season. There also might be reasons to
worry.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks into the season, the Diamondbacks insist all is well
with the player they have signed to be their center fielder through
2002. No matter that he is batting .232 after 112 at-bats, which
ties him for the third-highest at-bat total in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, people such as Manager Buck Showalter, hitting
coach Jim Presley and even a former teammate say that starting slow
is nothing new for Finley, who traditionally has had his worst
months at the start of a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, he's hot right now compared to what he usually is,''
said Cincinnati's Greg Vaughn, who played with Finley each of the
past two years in San Diego. ``Like me, he's a thinker. Anytime you
think in baseball, you get in trouble. He needs to get to the point
where he's, `See the ball, hit the ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Steve, he's a gamer. You can pencil his name
into the lineup and he'll play his butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley has only four hits in 23 at-bats (.174) with runners in
scoring position. ``Terrible,'' he said about that particular
statistic. Only two of his groundouts have been to the left side of
the infield, an indication that he is trying to pull the ball too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I want to do better,'' said Finley, who led off
Wednesday's victory with a ground-rule double and scored the game's
first run. ``I feel I'm going to get a hit every time I step into
the batter's box. I believe I can hit .400. It's not a goal, but
that's my mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of Finley's game that remains unrivaled is his defense.
A two-time Gold Glove Award winner in center field, Finley remains
one of the best defensive players in the game, catching almost
everything hit from gap to gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best center fielders I've ever had,'' said
Showalter, who has managed Bernie Williams and Devon White. ``When
I put my head on the pillow at night to sleep, Steve Finley is one
thing I do not worry about. I look at it like someone's going to
pay down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter called Finley into his office before Wednesday's game
in Cincinnati for a quick pep talk. He wanted to make sure that
Finley knew he wasn't about to be benched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know how happy we are with him,'' Showalter
said. ``Steve Finley is a winner. There's a reason he's been around
winning clubs throughout his career. He's just frustrated now
because he's not clicking on all eight cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch Finley's eyes and body language inside the clubhouse and
he looks like someone who still does not feel he's pulling his
weight, which is common with a struggling player in his first year
with a new club.
</P>
<P>
   Another point that may be dragging Finley down is his contract.
He signed a four-year deal worth $21.33 million. The next-largest
offer was a three-year deal for $12 million from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' Finley insisted. ``I feel like I know
I could be doing better, but that's baseball. If I was in my first
few years in the game, I'd be worried like hell. As long as we're
winning, I honestly don't care what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his best seasons, 1995 and '96, Finley sprayed the ball
around the park with regularity. He also slammed 30 and 28 home
runs, the highest totals of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the game believe Finley fell in love with the home run
after those two seasons, the second of which saw him finish 10th in
the Most Valuable Player voting and help lead the Padres to their
first playoff appearance in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a timing guy,'' Presley said. ``Sometimes all it takes is
one swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it that ground-rule double Wednesday night? The Diamondbacks
and Finley certainly hope so. &QL;

 &HT;    Expect presidential gridlockBy Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ President Clinton's coming to town today, but
the closest many Austin residents will get to him will be as
they're stalled in traffic while the presidential motorcade goes by
in the middle of rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One is scheduled to arrive shortly after 5 p.m. at
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Southeast Austin. The
president will spend an undetermined amount of time there before
his motorcade winds its way through the streets of Austin to a
fund-raiser in the West Austin home of his longtime friend Roy
Spence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will stay overnight at the Driskill Hotel at Sixth and
Brazos streets, and he'll arrive there late in the evening, just as
the night life on Sixth Street kicks into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wilkinson, Austin's resident agent in charge for the Secret
Service, said Brazos from Sixth to Seventh will be closed while the
president is at the Driskill, and police barricades will be erected
around the hotel's perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service has been working for days with Austin police,
Travis County sheriff's office and the Texas Department of Public
Safety on safety and traffic preparations. Secret Service officials
won't release the route of the presidential motorcade, but delays
are likely as police escorts barricade streets.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic disruptions usually last no more than five to 10
minutes, Wilkinson said.

 &HT;    $260 million claim for tobacco suit fees dropped
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Texas _ Embattled Houston attorney Marc Murr dropped
a claim for $260 million in legal fees Wednesday for work he said
he did on the state's landmark settlement with the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected move was hailed by Attorney General John Cornyn
as a ``complete victory for taxpayers of Texas.'' But questions
remain about what Cornyn will do next about allegations he made
that Murr and former Attorney General Dan Morales committed fraud
by creating bogus contracts used as the basis for the legal claim.
</P>
<P>
   And sources have told The Associated Press that the FBI has
begun an investigation, although many principals in the contract
dispute, including Morales, say they have not been questioned by
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said Cornyn was a liar motivated by politics. Cornyn
said Thursday he stood by every word.
</P>
<P>
   Murr's move to drop his claim also masks the fact that Murr will
still get $1 million in fees for work that many said he did not do.
That is because two arbitration panels _ at the national and state
levels _ set fees for Murr. The state recommended $260 million; the
national panel said Murr should get $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Murr gave up in the face of what we believe was
overwhelming evidence,'' Cornyn said after the hearing in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   But Murr's attorney, Roy Minton of Austin, said Murr would
probably make another claim for legal fees. U.S. District Judge
David Folsom said Murr has 60 days to make a new claim by
requesting another arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move, if Murr made it, could revive Cornyn's stinging
allegations that Morales fabricated two contracts Murr used to
establish his arbitration case. He originally sought 3 percent of
Texas' tobacco settlement, or $520 million, based on a contract
Cornyn said was a fake in court papers he filed Wednesday. But
asked to show the proof of his claims, the attorney general
declined. ``We are continuing our investigation into other aspects
of the tobacco attorneys' fees arrangement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said Morales ``gave us no choice'' but to reveal in court
papers the allegations that Morales fabricated contracts because
the former attorney general refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Was it done to intimidate Murr? ``I'm not in the intimidation
business,'' Cornyn replied.
</P>
<P>
   Murr was ordered to appear before U.S. District Judge David
Folsom to answer questions about how the state arbitration was
handled. Folsom had ordered the arbitration and stated in the order
that he would appoint one of the three members to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But Morales and Murr chose all three members without waiting for
Folsom, a move that Cornyn said completely violated the judge's
order and, therefore, made the $260 million award worthless. Cornyn
has said that he feared Texas taxpayers may have been liable for
the money, instead of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Murr, once called the ``stealth lawyer'' by attorneys for the
tobacco industry, slipped out of the courtroom without comment as
reporters huddled around Minton.
</P>
<P>
   In a carpeted, ornate Texarkana courtroom that served as the
ring for a legion of lawyers who fought in the 3-year-old tobacco
case, Murr's offer to vacate his arbitration award brought the
latest contest to an anticlimactic close. Ten minutes after the
hearing began, Minton and his son, David, his law partner, packed
up their briefcases to leave.
</P>
<P>
   They had huddled with Cornyn and Cornyn's first assistant, Andy
Taylor, in Folsom's chambers for little more than a quarter-hour
before Folsom called the hearing to begin. Cornyn said later that
he cut no deals. In the pleading filed Wednesday, Cornyn alleged
that Morales faked a contract with Murr, a friend and onetime
colleague in a Houston law firm, to set up Murr's separate
arbitration of his legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrators awarded Murr $260 million after Morales and Murr
presented them with a second, earlier contract that said Murr would
get 3 percent of whatever Texas recovered from the cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said that second contract, dated Oct. 17, 1996, had
actually been created last year, weeks before Murr's September
arbitration.

SYNCHRONIZED AND SHARING, LAKERS GET HOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When Mother's Day arrives this weekend, the
Lakers might want to thank mom for that old lesson about sharing.
It's possibly the key to their turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Left for dead just a week and a half ago, the Los Angeles Lakers
closed out the season with four straight wins, three of them routs,
and are once again being talked about as contenders for the Western
Conference title. Their fortunes turned when they started sharing
the ball on offense and sharing responsibility on defense.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, the Lakers averaged 21 assists per game. But in
this winning streak, they've dished out 28 assists on average. The
same Lakers team tagged as a loose collection of me-first ball hogs
with personal agendas now makes more passes than Bill Clinton at a
NOW convention.
</P>
<P>
   A similar team approach on defense has keyed a run in which they
held the last four opponents to a combined 42.4 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   And all of that emerged from the Lakers' soul-cleansing team
meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have come together,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``They stressed to each other areas which we have to improve. They
got rid of all their little issues....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for everybody to go out there and do what they want
to do.... The hard part is getting individuals to make sacrifices
of the things they like to do and pick up in the areas they don't
like to do for the benefit of the team, whether that's getting more
rebounds or passing the basketball more or playing better defense
individually or as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   So now Glen Rice, with 62 points in his past two games, is
clicking in the offense after previously looking lost among his new
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And Derek Fisher, who only recently reclaimed the starting
point-guard job he'd lost, is averaging 7.3 assists and 8.0 points
in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Horry, a bit player buried on the bench for parts of
the season, scored a season-high 22 points against Portland last
week.
</P>
<P>
   And Rick Fox, battling injuries and role changes for much of the
season, is averaging 12 points in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hot, man, we're rolling,'' Kobe Bryant said.
``Everybody's involved, everybody's in sync. That's something that
Kurt has been stressing, wanting to get everyone involved, wanting
to get everybody a boost of confidence going into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if leading scorers Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal have to give
up a few shots along the way to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanna win, that's all. I don't think it's a matter of
being selfish or unselfish,'' Bryant said. ``We just want to win
and we're going to do what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the young Lakers, lessons are learned the hard way. They had
lost six of eight games, concluding with a 27-point loss at
Houston, before that team meeting. Maybe they had to bottom out in
order to find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think so,'' Bryant said. ``We're a young team and
that's like your mother telling you to go outside and play, and you
have to fall on your face a couple times before you understand what
the hell she's talking about. That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   So thanks, mom.
</P>
<P>
   Two dimensional: Overshadowed in his 40-point outburst Wednesday
against Portland was Rice's solid defensive effort. Often
classified as a weak defender, Rice is among the Lakers who have
stepped up the defense during the recent winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been giving a maximum defensive effort,'' Rambis said.
``I've been more impressed with his defense than anything he's done
offensively for us since he's been here. To me that's just an
indication that he's ready to move up and be a major, key
ballplayer for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rice, ``I take a lot of pride in my defense. I hear a lot
of people saying, `Oh, Glen Rice can't play any defense.' I'm just
out to try to prove those guys wrong.''

TWO CRUISE LINES WILL BASE VESSELS IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For years, the Port of Seattle and the region's
business leaders battled futilely to get a cruise ship line to
operate from the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two cruise ship lines say they will base vessels here.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International announced Thursday that next year
it will become the second cruise ship line to operate at the Port
of Seattle's Bell Street Pier facilities at Pier 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-based cruise line said it will base its
2,000-passenger Vision of the Seas in Seattle for voyages through
Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the San Juan Islands and
Canada's Inside Passage to Vancouver and Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line announced last year that it will operate
21 seven-day summer cruises to Alaska aboard its 2,000-passenger
Norwegian Sky from Seattle's Bell Street Pier terminal beginning
May 7, 2000, under a four-year agreement with the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that cruising is an ideal way to really experience
this part of the country, which boasts spectacular scenery and
wonderful ports of call,'' said Jack Williams, president of Royal
Caribbean International.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle officials said that each vessel call will pump
nearly $1 million into the community. The two cruise lines are
expected to create 400 new jobs, produce $74 million in business
revenues and generate $8.4 million in state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides longshore and stevedore jobs, the cruise ships directly
create jobs for ticketing and reservations agents and business for
provisioners of bunker fuel, food and a range of items and services
that include flowers and piano tuners.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle commissioners have authorized construction of a
$12.9 million cruise terminal at the Bell Street Pier facility,
which contained only a shell for a cruise terminal when the $110
million, 11-acre pier opened in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal Caribbean is using the seven cruises next year as a test
of the itineraries in the new market,'' said port spokesman Imbert
Matthee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works out well, we assume they will go for a longer
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean will launch its Port of Seattle operations with
a one-night cruise for travel agents on May 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 22 and 29, 2000, it will have four-night cruises into
British Columbia. On May 19 and 26, it will have three-night
cruises and on June 2, 2000, a two-night cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line's lease gives it exclusive use of the
port's cruise ship terminal on Sundays, a preferred day for
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean will operate its Vision of the Seas voyages on
Mondays and Fridays, Matthee said.
</P>
<P>
   Large vessel cruising from the Port of Seattle had been stymied
for years by the 1886 Passenger Service Act, which bars
foreign-registered cruise ships from stopping at more than one U.S.
port per voyage to pick up or drop off passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the law's restrictions, cruise lines have operated
extensively from Vancouver, B.C., with many cruise ship passengers
arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and being bused to
Vancouver. Vancouver's harbor has become increasingly crowded with
cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Seattle and Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce
unsuccessfully backed efforts to get Congress to change the law,
but the two cruise lines that will operate here have found ways
around the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Caribbean cruises will stop at two Canadian ports
before completing a round-trip voyage to Seattle, complying with
the 113-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Cruise Line voyages will stop at Alaskan ports,
but won't drop off passengers before heading back to Seattle with a
stop in Vancouver, B.C., also under the law's provisions.

THREE DIE IN OKLAHOMA HOSPITALS AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
and DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Scores of families rejoiced Thursday as loved
ones were found safe after Monday's tornadoes, but officials said
more than a dozen people still missing are likely dead.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of missing fell dramatically in Oklahoma, from
more than 100 to just 14, hopes for those faded as search teams
brought in dogs trained to sniff out bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died in hospitals overnight Wednesday, bringing the
confirmed Oklahoma death toll to 41. Five died in Kansas and one in
Texas in the initial storms. Four more people were killed Wednesday
as bad weather continued to roll eastward across the southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   The dead identified Thursday included two people from the rural
community of Bridge Creek. Asheton Darnell, a 3-week-old boy, had
been ripped from his mother's arms and found in a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Wiese, a 26-year-old single mom who had been clinging to
her son as well, also perished while her 6-year-old child survived.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Hospital, the father of three injured children
told a remarkable story of survival. Sean York of Midwest City said
he and the children were huddled in the family bathtub, covered by
a mattress, when the house exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It threw us up out of the tub,'' York said. ``I landed on the
ground, and the house was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The children were tossed up to 50 yards in the darkness, and
York found them only when the roar of the twister faded and he
could hear their cries. He first reached 6-year-old Dustin, who was
sitting in the middle of the back yard near two small neighbor
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I found my neighbors' little 4-month-old boy, and he was
already passed,'' York said. He was referring to Jeffery Yonnes Jr.
</P>
<P>
   York's wife, Susan, was at a friend's home when the tornado
struck. Now, she tends to her husband and three children, all of
whom are hospitalized. Daughter Tierra, 8, remained unconscious in
intensive care after suffering the worst injuries: a bruised brain,
dislocated left arm and punctured right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stormy weather moved across the south, killing
four people in Tennessee on Wednesday and tearing off roofs and
knocking out power in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Thursday ordered federal disaster aid for
Bowie County to help clean up the damage after twisters touched
down in Texas on Tuesday, killing one person.
</P>
<P>
   Across Oklahoma City and its battered suburbs, as residents
scoured the rubble they once called home, local and state officials
again increased their estimates of the number of damaged buildings.
An official tally could take weeks, but some had feared the total
could approach $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma County officials Thursday upped the number of homes
destroyed or heavily damaged from 1,700 to 2,500 as they began the
painstaking task of counting lots.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate does not include what are known to be high totals
in nearby Moore and portions of Oklahoma City within Cleveland
County, which had not yet assessed the number of homes and
businesses destroyed. In the heavily hit municipality of Del City
alone _ damage assessment teams began their work there _ 560 homes
were on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma County Tax Assessor Mike Means said the bulk of the
homes will be removed from the tax rolls. ``There's nothing
salvageable at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that cleanup efforts were threatened by
camera-clicking crowds that were clogging streets of the wrecked
subdivisions eager for a glimpse of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having many, many sightseers coming into these
communities, and we're particularly concerned with the weekend
coming up,'' said Oklahoma County Emergency Management Director
David Van Nostrand said. ``All the traffic in the area is hindering
the cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was the huge amount of debris, estimated at 220
million cubic yards, left to be cleared away. Leaders from Oklahoma
City and its Midwest City, Del City, and Choctaw suburbs were
discussing the problem Thursday with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Storm sewers are full of debris, and concern was growing
Thursday about hazardous chemicals and rodents in the growing heaps
of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rats and mice, that's a developing problem,'' Van Nostrand
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of most pressing concern, however, were those still unaccounted
for three days into one of the worst tornado disasters to strike
the Oklahoma plains. While law enforcement authorities have
searched the rubble at least three times for victims, FEMA said
special dog-handler teams, including two from Texas, were arriving
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials became convinced that the 14 people still listed as
missing probably died in the tornado rampage. Searchers focused on
areas in Bridge Creek, south Oklahoma City, Moore, Del City and
Midwest City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified either where the people were supposed to
live, or where they might have been, and those are the areas that
will be searched,'' said Ray Blakeney, director of operations for
the state Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Examiner Dr. Fred Jordan said identification of the last
10 or so victims was slowed because of the severity of their
injuries. And he said that unlike victims of the 1995 federal
building bombing in the city _ which included many federal
employees _ most of the tornado victims had no fingerprints on
file.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan said that as of late Thursday almost all of the 41
bodies had been released to various funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're very close to the end of this process,'' he said.

SOCKET TO 'EM: CHAPMAN GIVES BOOT TO HIS GOGGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Apparently, the great goggle debate is over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rex Chapman hasn't said much about his dislike for the goggles
he was required to wear in the last few games as protection for a
broken bone at the base of his right eye socket.
</P>
<P>
   But Chapman's actions said plenty Thursday after the Suns' final
practice before departing for Portland, where they will work out
today and open the NBA playoffs against the Trail Blazers on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When assistant coach  &UR; Frank Johnson handed Chapman the goggles
after a workout, he dropped them to the floor, stomped on them,
kicked them across the court and continued his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The $300 goggles remained on the floor, in two pieces, long
after Chapman was gone. Guess he won't be taking them to Portland,
unless somebody applies a &UR; Kurt Rambis tape job. &QL; 
Roster &QL; 
The Suns submitted their 12-man playoff roster, and there were few
surprises. Guard  &UR; Gerald Brown, who finished the regular season on
the injured list, was placed on the playoff roster. Rookie &UR; Toby
Bailey, who finished the regular season on the active roster, was
not included.
</P>
<P>
   Guard  &UR; Randy Livingston, who scored 12 points and handed out
three assists in his debut Wednesday night, was impressive enough
in the season finale against Minnesota to earn a spot on the
playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was in the playoffs as a rookie with Houston three
years ago. He had just helped Sioux Falls win the Continental
Basketball Association title when the Suns called _ in the nick of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying to you if I said the last couple of years hasn't
been frustrating,'' he said. ``I had to be patient. Matter of fact,
I was on my way to Venezuela when I got the call from the Suns.'' &QL; 
Bulletin board &QL; 
Portland's &UR; Isaiah Rider provided the first salvo in the war of
words that goes with every playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix can't guard us, but they can put the ball in the
basket,'' Rider said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Suns center  &UR; Joe Kleine replied, ``That's kind of funny that
Isaiah Rider is talking about defense. Instead of worrying about
our defense, he should worry about what time their shoot-around
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Rider has a long history of being late for
or missing shoot-arounds and workouts. He missed one this week. &QL;

RAMBIS FATE LIKELY HINGES ON LAKERS' PLAYOFF SHOWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Now is when it really begins. That wild ride
of a regular season that served as Kurt Rambis' introduction as an
NBA head coach will be left as so much melodramatic preamble.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers will be judged by what they do in the
playoffs, and similarly, so will Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   If they make a deep run into the playoffs, it could prove the
beginning of a lengthy Lakers coaching career for Rambis. Get
bumped out in the first round, it could well make for a quick
coaching exit.
</P>
<P>
   If Rambis longs for a coaching marathon, it's a maddening and
unpredictable sprint that awaits. This is big-time, career-turning
pressure, yet Rambis shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't put that pressure on myself, so I don't worry
about it,'' Rambis said. ``I try and control the things I can and
not worry about the things that I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers open a difficult first-round matchup Sunday with the
veteran Houston Rockets, who are led by veteran coach Rudy
Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis has had to cut his coaching teeth during a chaotic
regular season. He took over for fired Del Harris 12 games into the
season. Dennis Rodman came, Dennis Rodman went. Eddie Jones and
Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Glen Rice,
J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong, who was then waived. Jerry West
retreated to the shadows. The Lakers struggled.
</P>
<P>
   And Rambis was told to go coach.
</P>
<P>
   As others wait to pass judgment on Rambis based on the Lakers'
postseason performance, several players believe it already should
be a dead issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by now, he's passed with flying colors,'' guard Kobe
Bryant said. ``It has to be (difficult), with everything he's been
through. Are you serious? Having to put up with all this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be thinking about what people are going to say
about him. People will criticize him. Who cares? As long as he
keeps improving as a head coach, it's going to pay off in the long
run anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as that run doesn't come to a sudden stop against
Houston. He has no contract beyond this season. His fate awaits in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't necessarily be fair, but it probably will go down
like that,'' guard Derek Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Rambis was the Lakers' ultimate role player _
crashing the boards, diving for loose balls, taking the charge,
playing tough defense. The counter-culture forward with the
lunch-pail work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, 41, believes having to work harder to become an NBA
player is serving him well in becoming an NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning, I'm still developing,'' Rambis said.
``Like the team, I still have a lot of things to learn. As a
player, I never felt I knew everything. I never felt I could sit
back and say, `I'm satisfied with how I am as a player.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Having only ended his 14-year NBA career in 1995, Rambis
remained close to the players the last two years as a Lakers
assistant coach. At the end of a practice or before a game, he
would tutor all who were willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a players' coach,'' Bryant said. ``He talks to the
players, he listens to the players, lets the players make a lot of
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rambis has felt his relationship with the players slowly
evolve down a different path.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I would like to think of myself as a buddy to all
these guys, you just don't have that type of relationship as a head
coach anymore,'' he said. ``Because if you're a player who's not
playing, it's my fault now and the buddyness just kind of goes out
the window because they're ticked off.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been far from a smooth ride, but the Lakers have won four
consecutive games heading into the playoffs, and Rambis said they
are playing their best basketball of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers management is not saying whether that will lead to
another season for Rambis. West, their executive vice president,
remains in the background. General manager Mitch Kupchak would
rather Rambis not be an issue heading into the playoffs, and his
comments are guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into it,'' Kupchak said. ``This is really
not the time to start talking about it, because it will lead to
other questions. But he's done a wonderful job and we're very happy
with what he's done to date. I don't think myself or Jerry would
have done anything differently than what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his first, and perhaps most significant,
postseason as a head coach, Rambis said his approach to the
pressure is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still sleep at night, so I guess it can't be that bad,'' he
said.

REFINED BASE STEALING
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin worked extensively
this spring to become a more dangerous threat on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers continue to reap the fruits of that labor.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin entered last night's game with an American League-best
14 stolen bases in 17 attempts for a gaudy 82.4 success rate.
Goodwin stole 38 bases during 1998, but was caught a league-high 20
times, a 65.5 percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I'm seeing right now _ good leads, good
acceleration and good slides,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``He's also doing a good job of picking the right pitches and right
counts to run. He's also healthier than he was at any time last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin worked daily this spring with first-base coach Ed
Napoleon and minor-league instructor Dick McLaughlin to ensure
improvement in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those little things mean a lot on bang-bang plays,'' Napoleon
said. ``It's a game of inches, and you've got take to as many of
those inches as you can get.'' PITCHING DECISION WANTED
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays, the Rangers' next opponent, feature a
bullpen in transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays traded struggling closer Robert Person to the
Philadelphia Phillies for left-hander Paul Spoljaric on Wednesday.
Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi plans to implement a
closer-by-committee with left-handers Graeme Lloyd and Dan Plesac
expected to appear during most save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Kelvim Escobar, a member of the Blue Jays'
rotation, likely will become the closer when right-hander Joey
Hamilton returns from the 15-day disabled list. Hamilton is
scheduled to start Monday for Triple-A Syracuse while on his
medical rehabilitation assignment and could rejoin the Blue Jays'
rotation for a start May 15 against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get my mind ready to do one or the other,'' Escobar
told reporters Wednesday. ``They have to make a decision. Right
now, I don't know what is going on.'' AVOIDING THE RED SOX ACE
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers last night concluded the first of their five
two-game series scheduled this season.
</P>
<P>
   Players dread two-game series because of the inconvenience and
wear-and-tear that the resulting travel causes. However, the
Rangers' two-game series with the Red Sox worked to their favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will miss facing Red Sox right-hander Pedro
Martinez, the American League's pitcher of the month for April. The
Red Sox plan to start Martinez (5-1, 2.06 earned-run average)
tonight against AL West-rival Anaheim. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman, who provided the Rangers two
scoreless innings of no-hit relief during Wednesday's 8-3 victory
against Boston, entered yesterday's games leading the league's
relievers in ERA (0.93) and opponents' batting average (.109).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' organization promoted right-hander Chris Tynan and
infielder Frank Marciante to Class-A Savannah from their extended
spring program and demoted outfielder Ernies Baez and right-hander
Douglas Silva from Savannah to their extended spring program.

THE CAM-DO KID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jose Canseco has been through two divorces,
three major surgeries and a number of incidents involving police.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the American League's most valuable player, and he
has suffered a major arm injury in a frivolous pitching appearance.
He was once called the best player on the planet. Other times he
has been considered washed up, over the hill and simply finished.
</P>
<P>
   He is with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, his fifth team in six
years. His remarkable career has taken more twists and turns than a
Robert Ludlum spy novel. Yet through it all, Canseco keeps smiling
and whacking, hitting .279 with 10 home runs and 23 runs batted in
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you start shaking your head and wondering what might
have been, Canseco comes roaring back, thumbing his nose at his
many former employers and bashing as many home runs as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about feeling sorry for this guy. He might get that
plaque in Cooperstown, N.Y., before it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every player who has ever hit 500 home runs is in the
Hall of Fame,'' Canseco said. ``I don't know if the criterion has
changed, because a lot of guys in this era could hit 500 home runs.
But that's still a lot of home runs, and if that's still the
criterion, then I hope I do get voted into the Hall of Fame. It
would be a great thrill for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco expressed those hopes during a telephone interview
Wednesday. Later that night he had to leave the Devil Rays' game in
the third inning with a bruised left knee, a reminder that
injuries, not personal problems, are what's kept him from achieving
the full greatness once expected.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Canseco has learned to take conditioning more
seriously than in his younger days. Remember, this is a guy who
showed up for spring training with the Rangers saying he didn't
care what kind of town Port Charlotte, Fla., was as long as he
could get a pizza delivered.
</P>
<P>
   He was half-joking, but he has learned. Canseco said he hired a
personal trainer this off-season, is on a strict diet and hits the
weight room harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 21 or 22 years old, you take your health for
granted,'' Canseco said. ``My first years with Oakland I averaged
159-160 games a year. I could pop out of bed and run sprints any
time. But when the injuries come and you're missing ballgames and
you know you could be hitting 40-50 homers and helping the
ballclub, it becomes more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you realize you need to do everything you can to stay
healthy and help the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild: ``I think he's come to
terms with who he is and what his career means to him and what,
probably, life is all about in a lot of ways. A lot was thrown at
Jose in a short period of time. That doesn't mean his behavior is
acceptable, but there are reasons for it at times. Like I said, I
think he's come to terms with a lot of it and gotten past a lot of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco still hits for power when he's healthy. He showed that
last season when he hit a career-high 46 home runs with 107 RBI for
the Toronto Blue Jays. He also had 583 at-bats, the first time
since 1991 he has had more than 439 at-bats in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with the Devil Rays in the winter, Canseco began
this season averaging one home run every 15.2 at-bats. If he had
stayed injury-free, he would have more than 500 home runs by now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his 10 homers give him 407 for his career. But he's
thinking beyond 500 home runs. Canseco, 34, said he has a chance
for at least 600, a level reached only by Hank Aaron (755), Babe
Ruth (714) and Willie Mays (660).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of setbacks, three surgeries, \Rnine\S times on
the disabled list,'' Canseco said. ``There was a time when 500 home
runs didn't seem a possibility. I also know one more injury could
be career ending. But I hit 46 home runs last year and drove in 107
runs. If I stay injury-free, 500 home runs is a definite
possibility. After that, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco said there were times the past few years when he thought
about retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being a competitor, you've always got to give yourself
that last chance,'' Canseco said. ``You don't want to retire at 34,
35 years old and then say, well what if I could have stuck with it
a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still the love of the game and the feeling you get
when you go up there with the perfect swing and hit the ball
perfect and smack it 500 feet. I've got a lot of time to make up,
and I've got a lot of good years left in me, if my health lets me
have them.''  &LR; tagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817) 390-7760

COWBOYS LAMENT PASSING OF TEAMMATE, ``OLDER BROTHER''
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he talked Thursday about the sudden death of his friend, his
teammate, the man he said was like his ``older brother,'' Daryl
Johnston's voice trembled with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It dawned on those who listened that of all the episodes and
misfortunes that the Cowboys have endured, tragedy had not been one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   It hadn't been like the Detroit Lions, on whom fate seems to
have laid an unremitting curse. Three Lions have died while they
were active players. And in 1974, coach Don McCafferty suffered a
fatal heart attack during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   It hadn't been like the Kansas City Chiefs, who lost a promising
running back named Joe Delaney, who drowned while trying to save
the life of a boy. Another Chiefs running back, Mack Lee Hill, hurt
his knee in a 1965 game and died of a stroke on the operating
table.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers lost David Griggs in a fatal auto
accident in 1995. A year later, the Chargers' Rodney Culver was
killed in the ValuJet plane crash in the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day that impacted a tremendous amount of lives,''
Johnston said Thursday as he mourned the sudden death of Mark
Tuinei.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that is going to take a long time to get
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Because, at 6-foot-5 and 320 pounds, he often seemed larger than
life, and because he so often had a smile to match, Tuinei left
those who met him with an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can ever find a person who spoke negatively of
Mark Tuinei,'' said Bill Bates, his former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   And so they called off practice Thursday and the Cowboys,
unaccustomed to tragedy's cold slap, swiftly departed Valley Ranch.
They had dodged cameras before, but this time was different.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a veteran Cowboy who hadn't laughed at one of Tui's
practical jokes or wasn't hardened by Tui's courage. Tuinei retired
after the 1997 season. His knees had deserted him months before
that.
</P>
<P>
   To Tuinei, the ongoing knee problems had been merely another
challenge. It had been a challenge just growing up in his tough
neighborhood on Oahu. It had been a challenge after he had gotten
booted out of UCLA for fighting and then found that his fists had
caused him more trouble back in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the university's ROTC program turned his angry
world around, Tuinei felt. Years later, after he had become a star
on a Super Bowl championship team, Tuinei flew the man who got him
into the program to Dallas. At a charity golf tournament, Tui
introduced him as ``the man who turned around my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never one that looked for attention for himself,'' said
Tex Schramm, who was club president when Tuinei was signed as free
agent in 1983. ``He was a self-made man who had a lot to be proud
of, yet never called attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until the end of his career that people started
realizing that he had become one of the best offensive linemen in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei, along with Bates, was a free agent at the Cowboys' 1983
camp in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Almost from the start, coaches were
impressed with Tuinei's mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought he'd be a great center,'' recalled Gil Brandt,
the former personnel chief.
</P>
<P>
   But for Tuinei, it was still a challenge. After the 1988 season,
the Cowboys placed him on their Plan B free-agent list. No other
NFL team claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   Eight seasons later, he was still playing. Still quietly doing
his job.
</P>
<P>
   To those of us who wrote about him for a living, Tui was the
amiable giant who answered questions, win or lose. We remember the
way he beamed when he learned that he had been selected to his
first Pro Bowl, a homecoming that the kid from the islands had
always only dreamed about.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Pono, a college athlete herself, defended him
fiercely, and we media people joked that we were more afraid of her
than we were of him.
</P>
<P>
   They had no children, but Mark Tuinei's Cowboys family was
large.
</P>
<P>
   As Bates and Johnston addressed the cameras and notepads
Thursday, it was a sobering scene. In so many ways, the Cowboys
have spent four decades on the edge. Why tragedy picked Mark Tuinei
is unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones must realize that the autopsy and toxicology
reports could reopen a maelstrom of controversy.

<P>
   But for now, the Cowboys mourn. A good man, one of their own,

   NEW YORK _ Nearly two years after leveling a police brutality
charge that shocked New York City, Abner Louima took the witness
stand Thursday and told a rapt courtroom audience a horrific
account of being tortured by two officers in the restroom of a
Brooklyn police station.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during Louima's three-and-a-half hours of
testimony, some of it brutally graphic, the 32-year-old Haitian
immigrant stood up, scanned the room and pointed at one of his
accused attackers, Officer Justin Volpe. Volpe stared back,
expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in calm, steady tones, his voice breaking only once,
Louima testified in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that after
being arrested in a Brooklyn street brawl in August 1997, he was
beaten in a police car by four officers, and that two of them later
took him into a restroom at the 70th Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   He said that there, while he was handcuffed and crying in pain
from a kick to the groin, one of the officers held him down while
the other thrust an object into his rectum and then his mouth,
telling him that he was tasting his own feces and warning him that
if he ever told anyone what had just happened, he would be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Volpe put an object in my rectum and pull it out and
he put it in my mouth,'' Louima said, speaking in heavily accented
English.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that the object was part of a broken broomstick.
They say that it tore his rectum and bladder, injuries that
hospitalized him for two months and required three operations.
</P>
<P>
   Louima did not identify the officer who held him down, but
prosecutors have charged that it was Officer Charles Schwarz. Like
Volpe, he and the other two officers on trial in the alleged
brutalization of Louima, who are accused only of beating him in the
police car, are white. Louima is black, which has given the case
racially charged dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Schwarz, along with Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder, are on trial on federal charges of violating Louima's civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the blistering start of cross-examinations that will continue
next week, Volpe's lawyer portrayed Louima not as the victim of
nightmarish police abuse, but as a money-motivated plaintiff who
was reciting a concocted, well-rehearsed story designed to win him
millions of dollars in a civil suit he has filed against the city
and police.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, contended that Louima was already
coming out ahead because he has been getting $2,000 a month from
the FBI for rent and other living expenses for himself and his
family, and additional money from supporters like the fight
promoter Don King. Those contributions, Kornberg said, has garnered
more income for Louima than his work as a private security guard
did before his encounter with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are making more money, getting more money per month from
the government, than you were making when you were working,''
Kornberg declared before Louima said he has been unable to work
since the alleged incident. In a series of questions about details
that Louima has given to investigators and to the news media about
his encounter with the police officers, Kornberg showed
inconsistencies intended to demonstrate that Louima's account of
abuse is not credible.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that Louima originally had said that he
had been attacked with a plunger, but that now the prosecution says
the object was part of a broomstick. And when Kornberg resumes his
cross-examination of Louima at the next trial session on Monday, he
is expected to stress two lies that Louima admitted to earlier
under questioning by a prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lies, Louima admitted under Vinegrad's friendly
questioning, was that he had originally told investigators and
reporters that one of the officers who attacked him had said ``This
is Giuliani time! It's not Dinkins time.'' David Dinkins, a liberal
Democrat, preceded the far more authoritarian Rudolph Giuliani as
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that true?'' Vinegrad, an assistant U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn, asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' responded Louima, his slender, 5-foot-8-inch figure clad
in a long black jacket and folded into the witness chair next to
Judge Eugene Nickerson's bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear any police officer make that statement?''
Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, explaining that he had begun falsely reporting
it at the urging of a supporter _ a brother-in-law of a nurse at
the hospital _ who told him he was an auxiliary police officer and
frequently heard police officers make such statements.
</P>
<P>
   Louima said the man told him, ``I must say it to get the mayor's
attention and the attention of people responsible for justice.''
Four months later, Louima testified, he confessed the falsehood to
federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plunger detail, he said he had honestly thought the
object was a plunger because while he had not seen the object, he
had seen Volpe pick it up inside the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg on Thursday did not reach what is expected to be the
most sensational topic of his questioning, involving his suggestion
in the trial's opening arguments on Tuesday that Louima had
suffered his rectum and bladder injuries not at the hands of
police, but in an act of consensual sex with another man before he
encountered the officers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A fifth defendant in the case is a sergeant, Michael Bellomo,
who is accused of trying to cover up the alleged beating of Louima
in the police car. All the defendants say the charges against them
are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The case was originally prosecuted in state court by the
Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, who turned it over to
the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary Carter, for federal
prosecution, in part because convictions in federal court could
bring stiffer punishments. Volpe and Schwarz could be sentenced to
up to life in prison if they are convicted of attacking Louima with
the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Describing what happened in the station house, Louima said the
officer identified by prosecutors as Schwarz brought him into the
restroom after loosening Louima's belt and pulling his pants and
underwear down to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I get inside the bathroom, Officer Volpe close the
door and I saw him pick up something by the garbage can,'' said
Louima, who added that his hands were cuffed behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened then?'' Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pushes me to the ground,'' the witness said, adding that
his face was ``close to the toilet bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he kick me on my groin,'' Louima replied, going from
there to a description of punches he said he suffered and the stick
attack that he said was inflicted on him.

NEW OWNERS WON'T LIKELY HELP A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The financially bloody battle for San
Francisco Bay approaches a crucial moment. Two syndicates are
competing to buy the Oakland Athletics, and a decision is expected
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could be the luckiest bunch since Custer's troops won
a free trip to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for baseball supremacy in the Bay Area has been
on-going for 31 years, ever since Charlie Finley was stupidly
allowed to move the Athletics from Kansas City in 1968. But the
Giants, who arrived in San Francisco 10 years earlier, might have
struck the decisive blow by building Pac-Bell Park, which is
scheduled to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are expected to cut off season-ticket sales at 28,000
some time this summer, a mind-boggling figure for a team averaging
18,139 per game now. But the Athletics are drawing only 14,241 per
game across the bay and have no chance of getting a new stadium any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Athletics are the only team whose facility was
deliberately made worse. The Coliseum was ruined for baseball when
the Raiders returned and underwent substantial football renovations
to appease Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But two groups are still willing to pay $122.4 million to
current owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann and keep the team in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Former A's vice president Andy Dolich heads one group, which
includes Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan and George ``I
Guarantee It'' Zimmer, owner of The Men's Wearhouse. The rest of
the group is also from the Bay Area and is the sentimental
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The other group is headed by San Francisco-area lawyer Michael
Lazurus and Arizona banker Lyle Campbell, and also includes Bob
Watson, the former Astros and Yankees general manager, and Cubs
announcer Steve Stone, who started his pitching career with the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   That group is considering making Watson chief operating officer,
which would make him the first black owner in baseball history.
Morgan's role with the other group is undefined, but Dolich would
likely be the main man.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for both groups is making something work in
Oakland, especially now that the Giants are finally getting out of
3Com Park and into their plush downtown digs.
</P>
<P>
   Both are also forced by contract to stay in Oakland at least
through 2004, so escaping to Las Vegas, Sacramento, Calif., or even
Mexico is out for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics wanted desperately to move to San Jose, Calif.,
but the Giants claimed that lucrative territory as their own and
major-league baseball backed them. The East Bay, the Athletics'
defined territory, has more than 2 million people but can't stand
alone as a market without help from San Francisco or San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have an admirable collection of young talent _ Ben
Grieve, Eric Chavez, Miguel Tejada and A.J. Hinch _ but they could
end up eligible for arbitration or free agency before the new
owners can assemble the proper supporting cast to produce a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our window of opportunity is small,'' manager Art Howe
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is, if the Bay Area had one team, it would be a
financial power. But the Giants could end up that way anyway with
their new ballpark, leaving the Athletics begging for scraps, as if
they aren't already.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing aspect of all of the whole situation is there are
two groups willing to buy into such a dreary business proposition.
But nobody ever made intelligence a prerequiste for owning a
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   That was proved a long time ago.

LEAVE KENTUCKY DERBY ALONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The first torn-up ``win'' ticket had barely
hit the floor when the cry went up to reduce the Kentucky Derby's
20-horse limit.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a Derby provided an argument for such a drastic break
with tradition, it was Saturday's 125th running at Churchill Downs
in Louisville, Ky., in which a first-turn traffic jam seemed to
cost more than half of the 19 horses any chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   So inconclusive was Charismatic's victory at 31-1 odds, in the
eyes of the handlers of most Derby losers, that as many as a dozen
of them are expected to test him again at the May 15 Preakness
Stakes in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who think the solution is to shrink the race next
year are Bob Baffert, who trained three of the losers; Daily Racing
Form columnist Mike Watchmaker (``It's Time to Limit Derby Field to
14''); and Washington Post columnist Andy Beyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(With 14) it would become a competition rather than a
crapshoot,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an argument for keeping the Derby as it is? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   A good argument.
</P>
<P>
   People forget the Derby isn't meant to be a definitive,
championship race. It's an event all its own, and the luck factor
so despised by fat-cat trainers and frustrated bettors is one of
its enduring charms.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun is the knowledge that you and I could go halves
on a cheap 2-year-old this summer and have a lottery player's
chance of winning the Derby _ if our little gelding gets good at
the right time and the contenders run into the hind end of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the winner must be kissed by the Fates is woven
through Derby lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of the unique things about the Derby,''
Churchill Downs president and CEO Thomas Meeker said on the
backstretch the morning after the race. ``The Derby has a way of
giving back to people at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is one way of saying: How bad a winner can Charismatic be
when he's owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis (affable spokesmen for the
sport), trained by D. Wayne Lukas (elected to the Hall of Fame four
days earlier) and ridden by Chris Antley (whose comeback from
weight trouble was the human-interest story of the race)?
</P>
<P>
   If Churchill Downs wanted the Derby to identify the best horse
in the country, it would follow the advice to shrink the field, and
it wouldn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It would adopt Baffert's other idea to allow trainers to select
their post positions in a ``draft'' order determined by horses'
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Then it would shorten the race from 1\ miles to the more common
1[ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Then it would push the race back from the first Saturday in May
to the first Saturday in July to allow time to weed out more
pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   Then it would move the race from the quirky running surface and
unpredictable climate of Churchill Downs to, say, Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   And it would open the race to 3-year-olds and up so all of the
best horses in the country could take part.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that although it would become the strongest,
fairest race of the year, it would cease to be the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeys said this was the roughest Derby they've seen. Yet
nobody got seriously injured. And the winner, though overlooked by
most fundamentals-minded bettors (he qualified under only four of
this column's ``Ten Commandments for Derby Handicapping''), was a
horse whose previous race tied for the best in the field according
to no less an authority than the Beyer speed ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Big field or not, there might have been little traffic if not
for the fact so many horses had the same stalking style.
</P>
<P>
   A year before the 2000 Kentucky Derby, racehorse owners already
are dreaming of glory, fans are trying to spot the winner among
precocious 2-year-olds, and Churchill Downs is preparing for
another crowd of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound like a race that needs to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Good point: Trainers have been talking about how they almost
claimed Charismatic when he ran for a $62,500 price at Santa Anita
in February. Mike Mitchell, in particular, said he would have
claimed the colt if not for the fact the Lewises were nice enough
to give him drag-racing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Said hard-bitten realist Bobby Frankel: ``Yeah, well, why didn't
they claim him? And another thing: Wayne Lukas is the only trainer
who could have won with that horse. He's the only one who would
have taken the horse to Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   This week: The best action takes place out of town Saturday,
with 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet (Gary Stevens) and '99
Santa Anita Handicap winner Free House (Chris McCarron) heading a
five-horse field in the Pimlico Special, and Arkansas Derby
winner-by-disqualification Certain (Kent Desormeaux) and Tampa Bay
Derby winner Pineaff (Sid LeJeune Jr.) among 10 in the Illinois
Derby. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Laffit Pincay,
9 wins; Alex Solis, 8; Garrett Gomez, 7; Brice Blanc, Chris
McCarron, Emile Ramsammy and Gary Stevens, 4. Trainers: Ron
McAnally and John Shirreffs, 4; Jack Carava, Vladimir Cerin, Jerry
Dutton, Bill Spawr and Darrell Vienna, 3.Handicapper helper: The
old-school way to pick the Preakness winner: Add each horse's early
running position to his finish in the Kentucky Derby; lowest number
is the choice. This year it's Cat Thief, who ran second for the
first three-quarters of a mile and finished third; 2 plus 3 equals
5. Next best are Charismatic (7 plus 1 equals 8) and Worldly Manner
(3 plus 7 equals 10). The theory is that Pimlico is kinder than
Churchill Downs to speed horses.
</P>
<P>
   On the stakes schedule: At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $100,000
Will Rogers Handicap, 3-year-olds, 1 mile on turf; Sunday, $100,000
Wilshire Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1 mile on turf. At
Golden Gate Fields: Saturday, $150,000 Yerba Buena Breeders' Cup
Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1] miles on turf. At
Sportsmans Park: Saturday, $500,000 Illinois Derby, 3-year-olds, 1[
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Mileposts: The owners of Event of the Year plan to X-ray the
Strub Stakes winner's left front knee again in 10 days before
deciding whether to retire the colt. Trainer Richard Mandella said
there are signs of weakness in the bone _ ``a warning that we might
have a problem if we don't stop. They (owners John and Betty Mabee)
might want to give him four months off and keep racing him.'' The
weakness was discovered after Event of the Year's disappointing
fourth-place finish in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap at Hollywood Park
on Saturday. Chips in the other front knee kept the horse out of
the 1998 Kentucky Derby.... Laffit Pincay completes a three-day
suspension today for interference in an April 25 race at Golden
Gate Fields. Pincay's nine wins in the first full week at Hollywood
Park put him within 93 of Bill Shoemaker's career-record 8,833....
Artax, who broke Dr. Fager's 30-year-old Aqueduct record for 7
furlongs by winning the Carter Handicap in 1:20.04 Sunday, is
scheduled to run next in the May 27 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont
Park.... R Far Out Star's maiden victory Wednesday was jockey Randy
Valdez's first since his apprenticeship expired.... Hollywood Park
wagering on Kentucky Derby Day set a record for the spring-summer
season _ $24.5 million.... Baseball's Joe Adcock, who died this
week at 71, was Louisiana's leading thoroughbred breeder 10
times.... Pat Valenzuela, recently cleared of robbery charges, met
with Hollywood Park stewards Sunday, beginning what figures to be a
long process of trying to get his jockey's license back. The
decision ultimately rests with the California Horse Racing Board.
Valenzuela hasn't ridden since 1997.

LITTON MAKES BIDS FOR TWO SHIPBUILDERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La., Miss., Va.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries made unsolicited offers Thursday
to buy both Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries, two
shipbuilders that were already planning to merge. The two
transactions would have a total value of $1.8 billion plus $600
million in assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   A double acquisition by Litton, which already owns the Ingalls
shipyard in Mississippi, would create the nation's largest
shipbuilder, one with capacity to build nearly any kind of ship.
</P>
<P>
   But it would reduce the number of large shipbuilders serving the
Defense Department to two from four, which could raise antitrust
issues at a time when the Pentagon has become more wary about
military consolidation than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, the Defense Department blocked at attempt by
the General Dynamics Corp. to buy Newport News because it would
leave the nation with only one builder of nuclear-powered warships.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael R. Brown, the chairman and chief executive of
Litton, said in an interview that Litton's acquisition would not
raise antitrust issues and would actually be good for the Pentagon
because it would create a strong competitor to General Dynamics,
which is now the only company that can build both nuclear and
non-nuclear ships.
</P>
<P>
   He said Litton had not had any formal discussions with the
Pentagon but was familiar with the government's position based on
the discussions that occurred relating to the General Dynamics' bid
for Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   The government has already approved the merger of Newport News
and Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Litton offered to merge with Newport News in a stock transaction
in which it would exchange 0.55 share for each share of Newport
News. At Thursday's closing price of $64.75, the offer would be
valued at $35.61 a share of Newport, or $1.3 billion, plus the
assumption of $600 million in debt. Shares of Newport News rose
12.5 cents, to $27.
</P>
<P>
   Litton offered to buy Avondale for $38 in cash, or about $500
million. Shares of Avondale fell 37.5 cents, to $31.75.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was announced after the close of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Litton, based in Woodland Hills, Calif., said either acquisition
could go ahead without the other. Brown said the combined companies
would have $7.4 billion in revenue and 58,000 employees. About $3.6
billion in revenue would come from shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, General Dynamics had 1998 revenue of $5 billion,
with shipbuilding accounting for $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Fricks, the chairman and chief executive of Newport
News, said in a statement that the company's board had authorized
preliminary discussions with Litton to evaluate the offer. Avondale
also said it would review the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions would be the biggest for Litton, which until
now has mainly done smaller deals to fill out product niches and to
expand into the information-processing business. Brown said the
company waited until now to make its offers because it was more
confident that the Pentagon intended to expand its number of ships.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Ingalls unit makes destroyers and cruisers. Newport,
based in Newport News, Va., makes nuclear-powered aircraft carriers
and submarines. Avondale, based in Avondale, La., makes amphibious
assault vessels, as well as commercial tankers and container ships.

DRAKE EXPECTED AT CAMP AFTER DOING TIME FOR DUI

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Even though defensive lineman  &UR; Jerry Drake has
nearly two months left on his prison term, the Cardinals still are
including him in their plans for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said after Thursday's voluntary camp workout
that he still plans to have Drake back for training camp.

<P>
   Drake is to be released from a state prison on July 3, three
weeks before training camp opens.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded no contest in December to two aggravated counts of
driving under the influence and was sentenced to concurrent prison
terms of six and four months. He was arrested twice in 1997, only a
month apart, for driving while under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, 29, played only one game last season because of a back
injury and was placed on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see how his back is,'' Tobin said. &QL; 
Job offer &QL; 
The Cleveland Browns have offered free agent linebacker  &UR; Jamir
Miller a one-year contract worth $1.2 million. The deal could be
worth as much as $1.5 million with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hasn't accepted the deal, however, and reportedly would
like a one-year contract worth $1.5 million that could grow to $2
million with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are the second team to make Miller a contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   He turned down a two-year, $6 million deal from the Cardinals
two months ago. They talked to him again after he switched agents
about a one-year deal worth under $1 million. &QL; 
Complete recovery &QL; 
Tobin said backup quarterback  &UR; Dave Brown is throwing the ball much
better than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a lot more comfortable with what we're doing,''
Tobin said of Brown, who signed with the team as an unrestricted
free agent last summer. ``He's more familiar with our receivers. I
think he's throwing the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he's also much healthier. He had a partially torn
rotator cuff a year ago. ``I tore my pec muscle with the Giants,''
he said. ``The rehab made my shoulder tight. All last year I didn't
throw well. It was frustrating.'' &QL; 
Bug's world &QL; 
Defensive lineman  &UR; Brad Ottis missed Thursday's workout because of
a spider bite on his right leg. He is expected back today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we call him, `Spiderman,' '' trainer  &UR; John Omohundro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spider was a Brown Recluse and the injury occurred at the
team's Tempe training facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we have a bunch (of spiders), but I know
there's one,'' Omohundro said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin was reminded that players in New York likely don't have to
worry about spider bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they might slip on the ice,'' Tobin said. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Running back  &UR; Mario Bates (ankle) and wide receiver  &UR; Ronnie
Anderson (strained quadriceps) also missed Thursday's practice.
Anderson could return next week while Bates likely won't be able to
run full speed for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Center  &UR; Mike Devlin also worked at guard at Thursday's practice.
It was the first time he has played the position since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end  &UR; Andre Wadsworth, the team's first-round draft
pick a year ago, returned to school at Florida State in the
off-season and is only two classes away from getting his master's
degree in sports administration. &QL;

COYOTES PLAYERS STAND BEHIND SCHOENFELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - While Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld enjoyed a
rare day off with 18 holes of golf, his disheartened hockey team
spent Thursday going through year-ending physicals and defending
their coach.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld is the center of speculation. Will owner Richard
Burke and General Manager Bobby Smith will let him honor the final
year of a three-year contract and coach next year? Or, will he
become the sacrificial lamb for the team's failure to reach the
second round of the NHL Stanley Cup playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Wednesday, in the wake of Tuesday's night 1-0
overtime ouster by St. Louis, that a decision on Schoenfeld's
future will be made within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While Schoenfeld was unavailable to the media Thursday, he said
during the playoffs that he is at peace with the job he has done,
adding he knows he has given his best efforts to his job and if
that isn't good enough, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   If the reaction of the team's players is any indication, Smith
has a slam-dunk decision upcoming. Schoenfeld will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there are changes made,'' assistant captain Teppo
Numminen said. ``It's part of the game and why management is there.
They'll do what they think best.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes the changes you make don't work out, and you
basically have to rebuild. It's the same thing with Shoney. I hope
the whole coaching staff is back. For two years they've done a
great job of giving us the information we need going into games. I
can't see any fault of theirs. They've done a great job here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that Schoenfeld finds himself under fire,
considering the Coyotes' 39-31-12 record and 90 points ranks as his
best statistical season as an NHL coach.
</P>
<P>
   The team's 90 points were second most in franchise history,
trailing only the 96 points in the 1984-85 season. That team beat
Calgary in the first round, only to be swept in the second round in
four straight by Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent ouster was the eighth straight time the franchise
has failed to escape the first round _ the third time it blew a 3-1
series lead _ and a trip to the conference semis was a not so
private mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The forechecking system Schoenfeld employs has also been
criticized by some as being too defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' captain Keith Tkachuk said. ``We're an
aggressive team. I know some people think we sit back, but
sometimes you just can't get there. Coach gives us the green light
to go out and do it offensively. Obviously, when you're missing a
lot of guys in the playoffs you have to play more defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get into a shootout when you're missing key
guys. But we get the green light to go and that's what I like. When
you don't win, the first guy they look at is the coach, which is
unfair. I hope he comes back because I know we can do better next
year under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Rick Tocchet, whose playoff performance was hampered by
an unreported cartilege tear in his rib cage prior to Game 6,
praises the coach's value as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made big strides with Shoney,'' he said. ``Everybody in
the room likes him. He's a good coach. A good tactical coach. He's
a good motivator. Those are good qualities in this era of sport.
Athletes make a lot of money and there are egos involved. It's
tough to find coaches to come in and be that type, and he has done
it for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got all he could out of every player we have, including the
kids who were called up. We just ran out of bullets (injuries) and
St. Louis had more depth at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adams, a 14-year NHL veteran who was limited to just three
games in the series because of a badly strained groin, said he
played in pain Tuesday was in part due to his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy playing for him,'' he said. ``He's the type of guy you
want to play for and guys want to do what they can for him. He's an
honest guy and hopefully he'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, who become a restricted Group II
free agent in July, pointed out he has played for four coaches
(John Paddock, Terry Simpson, Don Hay and Schoenfeld) in the five
years he has played for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a good thing when you have the same coach,'' he
said. ``In the five years I've been here we've had quite a few
coaches. It's gives you more stability when you come back and see.
You know what he wants from you and he knows the player. But it's
hard to say what will happen.'' &QL;

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Jeremy Roenick's decision to play in the
Coyotes' 1-0 overtime loss to St. Louis Tuesday night just 19 days
after surgery to repair a jaw broken in three places was an amazing
story, but it turns out there were a number of amazing stories.
</P>
<P>
   Winger Dallas Drake will undergo surgery today to repair a nose
that lists severely to port after it was broken midway through the
third period. He didn't miss a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Fans saw defenseman Gerald Diduck helped from the ice with an
injured knee in the third period after being submarined by the
Blues Geoff Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't know was that Diduck, playing in only his third
playoff game after missing 25 games with a broken foot, broke a
different area of his foot in the first period after blocking an Al
MacInnis slapshot and played superbly until the knee injury ended
his night.
</P>
<P>
   He reported for the team's year-end physical Thursday wearing a
walking cast on one leg and a knee splint to protect strained
ligaments on the other. The unrestricted free agent walked like a
robot.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Greg Adams, already playing with a strained groin,
matched his uniform number by taking 17 stitches in his right cheek
after it was sliced by MacInnis' skate. He returned to action.
</P>
<P>
   And defenseman Jyrki Lumme was playing with a shoulder still so
badly injured that he requires off-season surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Center Robert Reichel missed Thursday night's team party because
he left Phoenix Wednesday morning to see his family in New York. &QL; 
Corkum's future? &QL; 
One decision GM Bobby Smith must make concerns third-line center
Bob Corkum, who becomes an unrestricted free agent on July 1.
Corkum is believed to be seeking at least $1 million a year, and
some believe the team's recent signing of center Juha Ylonen to a
three-year contract means it won't re-sign Corkum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like very much to be back in a Coyotes uniform, but that
will be worked out this summer,'' Corkum said. ``I'll take it day
by day and see what happens. My family loves it here. I love it
here. I'd like to see this team through the second and third rounds
and eventually to a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have a lot of roots planted here and enjoy their
schools a lot. But you do what you have to do and kids will
adapt.'' &QL; 
Niki's fate &QL; 
Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin becomes a restricted Group II free
agent on July 1, but doesn't expect to draw an offer because, he
says, the compensation a team would have to pay for signing him
would be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is going to give me an offer,'' he said.
``I haven't talked to my agent yet, either. It's hard to say what
is going to happen because I don't know what Bobby Smith is
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would like to get his contract done as soon as
possible, Khabibulin said, ``As long as I get the right deal, I
don't care when I get it. I like the guys, city and fans here. I'd
like to stay here.'' &QL; 
Oleg disappointed &QL; 
The Coyotes decision to make Oleg Tverdovsky and healthy scratch
for Tuesday's Game 7 after playing in all 82 regular season games
and the first six playoff games left him a frustrated man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed,'' he said. ``I wanted to play and
thought I could help and bring something to the team. It was tough
to watch because you can't do anything about it.'' &QL;

BUSH ALREADY EXPLORING A UNITED AGENDA WITH HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to make clear House leaders have been talking to
Bush) (rm) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders are so united behind Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas for their party's presidential nomination
that they have already begun meeting informally with him to discuss
a common agenda in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   These meetings are the latest demonstration of the extraordinary
degree to which the party apparatus has concluded that Bush's
nomination is inevitable even though there are nearly a dozen
contenders, the governor has not formally announced his candidacy
and the first primary votes will not be cast for nine months. The
outpouring is all the more striking because members of Congress
traditionally prefer backing one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the nation's governors have already rallied to
Bush's side, and he enjoys many other institutional advantages,
including the early backing of more than a third of the Senate
Republicans as well as the behind-the-scenes encouragement from
fund-raising officials of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's support is so vast that his endorsements rival those of
Vice President Al Gore on the Democratic side. That is remarkable
given that Gore has only one opponent and has been the presumed
Democratic nominee to succeed President Clinton since their
election in 1992 _ two years before Bush was even elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of the groundswell for Bush is in the
House, where the top leaders are already backing the governor.
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois had agreed to be the Bush
campaign's chief House liaison, but he stepped aside when he rose
to the speakership. He is officially neutral only because of his
position.
</P>
<P>
   The second- and third-ranking House Republicans, each from
Texas, Dick Armey and Tom Delay, also back Bush. The chairman of
the House Republican conference, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, is a
member of Bush's exploratory committee, as is Rep. Roy Blunt of
Missouri, the chief deputy whip. In all, 94 House Republicans have
signed with Bush, including more than half the committee chairs.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders view Bush's nomination as so inevitable that they
recently began the informal meetings with him as well as his
advisers, including Karl Rove, his top strategist, to discuss a
unified agenda on issues ranging from Social Security to taxes to
education. They have also begun to discuss joint electoral and
fund-raising strategies for the 2000 campaign. The meetings were
first reported Thursday in Roll Call, a newspaper that circulates
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians involved in the sessions cautioned that they were
preliminary and were geared to announcing a common agenda at the
end of the primary season _ not for imminent policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes, as I believe, there's a great opportunity for us
to come together around a common set of principles,'' Armey said in
an interview. ``We'll work out the details through the basic
legislative process. You will probably see a final distillation of
all these ideas in a set of programatic objectives that would not
be announced formally until after he's the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said the participants were far from reaching specifics. On
Social Security, for instance, he said, there was only ``the sense
that this is something we'll want to address together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a member of Bush's exploratory
committee, said he has rounded up 20 senators to back the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell explained that there was ``a natural coalescing of
thinking'' between lawmakers and Bush. ``Where we think an issue is
developing, obviously, I'd be on the phone talking to him about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this budding alliance may say more about a
transformation among House Republicans than about Bush: It
underscores a reality that lawmakers of all stripes are so eager to
find a leader _ and to retake the White House _ that they are
willing to back a politician who is untested on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   That many of the most conservative members of Congress are
backing Bush may also reflect a triumph of pragmatism there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taming them and domesticating them from going on further
kamikaze missions like impeachment,'' said a supporter of Bush who
also works closely with House Republicans. ``I've got several
clients in the House who have gone down and met with Bush and said,
`I'm tired of being viewed as an extension of Trent Lott and Newt
Gingrich.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The overwhelming congressional backing could help Bush navigate
the minefield of national issues. And the support of many of the
most conservative members could also provide Bush cover so he can
espouse nuanced views on matters like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   So many House members are jumping on the Bush bandwagon because
he is so far ahead in the polls that they see him as inevitable.
Many lawmakers said they were also drawn to him because he comes
from a big state, has impressive political skills and has
successfully pulled in votes from Democrats and independents as
well as from Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians like nothing better than jumping in front of a
parade,'' said Ed Brookover, a strategist who is close to many
House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In backing Bush, members of Congress are passing over their own
colleagues in the race: Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Smith
of New Hampshire, and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, particularly Bush's rivals, warn that that the
Bush juggernaut amounts to short-sighed foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   One top strategist to a Bush opponent, who agreed to speak only
on the condition of anonymity, put it this way: ``They're
panic-stricken on Capitol Hill, and they're afraid they're going to
lose their five-seat majority. And they're looking for a savior.
But in trying to preclude a contest from taking place before it's
even started, they're putting an awful lot of eggs in the basket
for a candidate they know absolutely nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said the discussions
demonstrate the governor's commitment to developing ``a positive,
issue-oriented agenda.'' ``These discussions are about the agenda
that would emerge from the 2000 presidential campaign should
Governor Bush be elected president,'' Ms. Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party who
is a member of Bush's exploratory committee, said the early support
``should not be misread into thinking he's going to get the
nomination on a silver platter: he's not.''

CHURCHILL ADDS HOLLYWOOD PARK TO ITS COLLECTION 
TVG MEETS RESISTANCE 
VALHOL'S DECLINING BANKROLL 
PREAKNESS PREPARATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Churchill Downs, where the Kentucky Derby was run last Saturday
before a crowd of 151,051, announced Thursday that it had signed an
agreement to buy Hollywood Park race track in Inglewood, 11 miles
southwest of downtown Los Angeles, for $140 million in cash in the
latest and longest step toward extending its racing and gambling
operations coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will be closed later this year, will include 240
acres of land and the Hollywood Park Casino, a card club situated
at the track, which will be leased to Hollywood Park Inc. for $3
million a year. In January, Churchill Downs bought Calder Race
Course near Miami for $86 million, and declared its intention of
acquiring other tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the acquisition of Calder in Miami and now Hollywood Park
in Southern California, Churchill Downs will be positioned to be
the premier race track operator and simulcast broadcaster in the
United States,'' said Thomas Meeker, president of Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   R.D. Hubbard, chairman of Hollywood Park Inc., hailed the sale
as ``a major step toward our corporate objective of focusing on the
growth of our gaming businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   TVG Meets Resistance
</P>
<P>
   Control over betting at home has apparently created a rebellion
in the ranks of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ten tracks in the mid-Atlantic region, including Pimlico, the
Meadowlands and Monmouth Park, joined Thursday to protest the
recent decision of the NTRA to become a national wagering hub for
the Television Games Network as ``threatening the viability of the
racing industry in our states.''
</P>
<P>
   The tracks said in a letter to Tim Smith, commissioner of the
NTRA, that ``the details of the TVG partnership have been reviewed
only by representatives of five or six large tracks, and this
venture now is being forced down the throat of the rest of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Valhol's Declining Bankroll
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Racing Commission's decision Wednesday to
disqualify Valhol from the purse money he won in finishing first in
the Arkansas Derby subtracts $300,000 from the colt's bankroll,
leaving him with only $44,000 and a much reduced chance of making
the list of 14 horses allowed in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded that Valhol's jockey, Billy Patin, used
an electrical buzzer on Valhol, fined the rider $2,500 and
suspended him for the rest of the year. In the Kentucky Derby last
week, Valhol was allowed to run after his owner, James Jackson, won
a court ruling ordering the purse to be paid to him. The colt ran
with a new jockey, Willie Martinez, and finished 15th in a field of
19.
</P>
<P>
   But the racing commission still had to hear arguments and make
its own ruling in the case. It did, and Patin was the main target
although the colt's winnings were taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Preakness Preparations
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Preakness candidates were staying at Churchill Downs
rather than shipping to Pimlico in Baltimore, where the Preakness
will be run one week from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the Derby, was withdrawn from the
Preakness by his trainer, Scotty Schulhofer. But K One King
(eighth) was declared back in the Preakness a day after he was
withdrawn to undergo surgery for an ankle chip. ``We decided that,
as long as he is not hurting it's best for him to run,'' said his
trainer, Akiko Gothard.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who missed his chance to become the first trainer
to win the Derby three years in a row when all three of his
candidates ran out of the money, planned to send his favored entry
_ Excellent Meeting (fifth) and General Challenge (11th) _ home to
California. He also said that Prime Timber, who ran fourth, would
probably not go on to the Preakness either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a light horse,'' Baffert said. ``He came out of the Derby
pretty tired. He's telling me he needs more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave Silverbulletday, the sensational filly who
won the Kentucky Oaks for her 10th victory in 11 starts?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see how she draws next week, and then decide,'' Baffert
said from Churchill Downs. ``I don't want to run unless I think she
can win.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he said, Silverbulletday would remain in
Louisville, Ky., until next Wednesday. He was keeping open the
possibility that he would enter her in the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes
for fillies, which is run the day before the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, who won the Derby with his 31-1 former claimer,
Charismatic, said he would also wait until Wednesday to ship
Charismatic and Cat Thief (third) to Pimlico. &QL;

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ With its eye on making speedier deliveries to
East Coast customers, Dell Computer Corp. is transferring all
production of its consumer and small business computers to
Nashville, Tenn., beginning this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The move into Nashville with a regional campus is Dell's first
U.S. expansion outside of Central Texas and a major strategy shift
designed to increase the company's share of the consumer PC market
_ a segment it only got serious about within the past three years.
Dell is expected to spend some $200 million on office and
manufacturing space in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At an announcement in Tennessee's state Capitol on Thursday
morning, Dell officials said they immediately will begin hiring the
first of at least 600 assembly and 400 technical-support workers it
expects to employ in Tennessee by year end. The company said the
number may grow to 3,000 over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at the Round Rock-based company were quick to
point out that transfer of the operations wouldn't have a major
impact in North Austin, where its Dimension PCs aimed at consumers
and small businesses are made now. The estimated 3,000 workers
involved in assembly, technical support and service of the
Dimension will be offered training for new positions in the Austin
area, said spokesman Peter Scacco.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension assembly operations in North Austin will be
converted to manufacture other products, such as Dell's two
notebook lines and its OptiPlex PC for corporate customers, Scacco
said.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 18,000 workers in Central Texas, Dell is the
region's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, Dell Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins estimated that
about 15 Dell executives and managers who are intimately familiar
with Dimension production will be asked to move to Tennessee. The
remaining jobs will be filled locally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its strong work force, a quality of life similar
to Austin's and at least $40 million in government incentives,
Nashville was attractive because its location allows Dell to ship
computers within a day to the Eastern half of United States, where
the majority of the country's population lives, said Paul Bell,
Dell's senior executive for the home and small business group.
</P>
<P>
   With a Federal Express hub in nearby Memphis and a UPS hub in
Louisville, Ky., Dell will be able to manufacture Dimension PCs
later in the day and still guarantee overnight delivery, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our entire business model is about taking hours out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service is key to Dell's goal of being the No. 1
supplier to consumers and small business, segments that grew more
than 50 percent last year for Dell, Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement that wasn't completed until Thursday
afternoon, Dell will get $20 million in property tax exemptions for
40 years and other incentives from Nashville and surrounding
Davidson County.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which still has to be approved by Nashville's
44-member Metro Council, calls for the joint city-county government
to give Dell free use of up to 700 acres of land next to Nashville
International Airport and to demolish a dozen aging structures on
one parcel that once housed the region's mental health hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the state of Tennessee has pledged about $20
million for road, sewer and other such improvements and for
training area workers for Dell jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said Dell hopes the first Dimension will roll off the
assembly line by August from a nearly completed building east of
Nashville. That structure, which developers started without knowing
who their tenant would be, will house Dimension manufacturing
operations even while Dell moves into its first buildings on the
former hospital grounds early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing officials of Nashville's Metro Council Thursday
afternoon, Mayor Phil Bredesen said Dell's expansion ``represents a
minimum'' of 3,000 jobs in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, well it could be many times that,'' he said in
answer to one of several questions from the curious but generally
supportive council.
</P>
<P>
   And while he declined to comment on speculation that Dell might
grow to 10,000 employees here, Rollins voiced confidence in the
company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our trajectories and our growth rate, you're
going to see that we are going to need a lot of people and a lot of
help,'' Rollins said.

DYNAMIC WILLIAMS SISTERS ROLL ALONG AT ITALIAN OPEN 
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The scene is the same this spring at the Foro Italico _
the clay just as red, the cypresses just as green _ but the women's
roles are changing. The Williams sisters are walking tall and
making big strides, and the vast majority of their competitors are
not keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   Together, which is the way they still prefer to be, Venus and
her younger sibling, Serena, have already combined to win five
singles titles this year: three for Venus and two for Serena.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday at the Italian Open, against opponents who once
gave them trouble, the sisters took turns underscoring their
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Serena was the first Williams to make her point by defeating
Irina Spirlea, 6-2, 6-3. Then, with Serena watching from the
stands, Venus handled Anna Kournikova, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier match, second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, now
underpowered and still searching for good form after a hand injury,
was upset in straight sets by Sylvia Plischke of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Spirlea, a tall, straight-talking Romanian, exchanged a chest
bump and harsh words with Venus at the 1997 U.S. Open. The tension
between her and America's first tennis family has since dissipated,
but at last year's U. S. Open, Spirlea put an end to Serena's
tournament when she defeated her in the third round in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Serena won her first tour event in Paris and then
won again at Indian Wells in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's not giving you anymore the chance,'' Spirlea
said. ``She's not missing as much as she was missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, ranked 10th, is also creeping inside the baseline with
increasing regularity, hitting her ground strokes and service
returns earlier and getting into the net with some frequency on a
surface that is not always forgiving of net-rushers. Her body
language is different, too; her movement during and between points
is more economical and cocksure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the thing that has really moved up is my mental,'' she
said. ``I know how to work the game more and play points better.
It's just something that's grown. At the U.S. Open, I hadn't won a
tournament, but now I know what to do playing people like her in
her game.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus already knew what to do against Kournikova when they first
played in the final in Key Biscayne, Fla., last year. She won in
three sets, but at the time, it was uncertain which of the
teen-agers was heading to the top the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams at a career-high No. 5 in this week's ranking and
Kournikova, who has yet to win a tour event, at No. 13, the sport
now has the answer. And though Kournikova has split with coach
Pavel Slozil and stopped double-faulting at an embarrassing clip,
she could not find a way to keep Venus from firing service winners
and pulling her uncomfortably wide with big ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's quarterfinals, Serena should have the trickier test.
While Venus will face 11th-seeded Dominique Van Roost, Serena will
face No. 1 Martina Hingis, the only player not named Williams who
has won more tournaments than Serena this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that meant Hingis, Venus and Serena were now the
world's top three, Serena did not hesitate. ``Definitely,'' she
said. ``Of course. The statistics show it. It's just a fact for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the WTA computer does not yet reflect it, Hingis concurs,
and now she wants revenge for her 6-4, 7-6 loss to Serena in the
semifinals last month in Key Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is this is on clay, and I'm a more confident
player, and I take her more seriously than last time,'' Hingis said
Thursday night after her straight-set defeat of Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was kind of cocky on the court, and that kind of ticked me
off in a way. But this time, it's going to be different.''

STANLEY L. ROSENTHAL, 69, EXPERT ON THE TRACKING OF HURRICANES ,
 DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Lawrence Rosenthal, a former government meteorologist
who advanced the technology of tracking the formation and movements
of hurricanes, died on April 24 at his home in Miami. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal spent 33 years with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, a branch of the Department of Commerce.
From 1977 to 1993, he directed the Hurricane Research Division in
Florida, leading it through the devastation of the Miami area by
Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His division is part of the Atlantic Oceanographic and
Meteorological Laboratories, and he played a pivotal role in the
development of a three-dimensional hurricane model that is now
widely used.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn and graduated from City College
of New York in 1951. He earned an M.S. degree at Florida State
University in 1953 and then spent two years in the Army as a
weather forecaster. He later returned to Florida State and received
his doctorate in 1958. Two years later, he joined the staff of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in 1993, he was a senior research associate at
the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at
the University of Miami. He was a fellow of the American
Meteorological Society and sat on its committee on hurricanes and
tropical meteorology.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department in Washington honored him with its Gold
Medal in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal is survived by his wife of 45 years, Mildred Farlow
Rosenthal; two sons, Russell K. and David S., both of Miami; a
daughter, Sarah Lynn Rosenthal of Tallahassee, Fla.; and four
grandchildren.
