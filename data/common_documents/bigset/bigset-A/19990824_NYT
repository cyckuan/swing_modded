PICTURING THE DIGITAL FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (with VIDEO-25YEARS-SFCHRON)  
 By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future of home video is here right now, and it's digital.
Much of the technology is in place. Other aspects will be soon.
It's just that most people are not yet plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   Home video screens are going to be bigger and look more like
multiplex screens, and there will be more choices in what to see.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sony Trinitron HDTV monitor is typical of the shape of
things to come. It's in the wide-screen, letterbox format and
measures 34 inches diagonally. It sells for $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, Sony also has DVD video goggles for
personal headset viewing that cost $800.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to be watching some sort of digital TV,''
says Jim Barry, spokesman for the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association. ``Even more important, they will have
more control over what they're watching and when they're watching
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The four most powerful forms of communication _ the telephone,
radio, television and the Internet _ will be coming together and
bringing it home on a screen, Barry says. ``Now, is that screen a
television or a computer?''
</P>
<P>
   He says people ``are going to start thinking of TV as
components. Separate receivers and screens and set-top boxes. Is
that a TV set or maybe just a monitor?''
</P>
<P>
   Digital computer code brings it all together.
</P>
<P>
   The innovators include cable systems, satellite companies,
telephone companies, computer companies, electric utilities _
``anyone who has a pipeline into the home to deliver information
and entertainment is going to be looking for ways to leverage that
to get better quality,'' Barry says.
</P>
<P>
   People will continue to watch feature films on home video, as
they do now, on cable, via satellite dish or videocassette. DVD
will be a growing presence. But it's the set-top boxes, which
provide interactive communication, that will lead to a much wider
range of choices.
</P>
<P>
   There is already the equivalent of a digital VCR. ``You'll have
things like Replay Networks with a box that you hook up to the
TV,'' Barry says. ``By plugging it into the phone line, you become
the programmer. For example, you can record all Tom Cruise movies
(shown on TV) or all the basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner in the Bay Area is video on demand:
feature films available through cable any time the viewer chooses.
There will also be special events, such as rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The video-on-demand company DIVA in Menlo Park, Calif., is set
to roll out the service this fall via its first Bay Area cable
system, Chambers Communications in Novato, and other local cable
systems will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Customers using a remote control will be able to choose a
feature film from a library that can eventually reach 1,000 titles
through a service that streams video out through the cable to the
set-top box.
</P>
<P>
   The functions include pause, rewind and fast-forward. They apply
to concert events as well, so a song can be replayed _ or skipped.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Widespread availability of feature films on the Internet is
further down the line. The limited bandwidth now in place through
telephone lines leaves a lot to be desired for feature-film quality
on home computers.
</P>
<P>
   As for what is available online, Barry says, ``The challenge for
the moviemakers as well as the electronic delivery people is
protecting the copyright, putting a gate around it and a cash
register. This is one of the big obstacles right now.'' (The
situation is similar to downloading music via MP3.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the best picture quality and surround sound,'' he
says, ``right now you go DVD.'' As viewers plug into other digital
systems, they'll get better picture and sound quality, too.
</P>
<P>
   Films will still premiere in all the new multiplexes that are
springing up, but ``it is a very small percentage of the population
who actually go out to the movie,'' Barry says. The film studios
know this as well as anyone, and the first showing of movies in
theaters is also a marketing device for later release through the
chain of electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for DIVA, the video-on-demand company, says
big-studio premieres are not likely in the near future, except
perhaps as isolated special events. As video on demand becomes more
widely used and provides a larger revenue stream, ``the studios
will adjust the availability of brand-new releases accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   On DIVA, new releases are available in the same window as
pay-per-view on cable. The order of release is: theaters,
airplanes, video stores and cable.
</P>
<P>
   The bigness of home video extends to price. The $7,500 basic
price for the Sony Trinitron HDTV monitor at the Metreon store in
San Francisco is part of an integrated system that may cost as much
as $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   For an additional charge, the $800 DVD goggles hook up to a
Discman. The feature-film picture seen in this headset fills the
field of vision like a 19-inch screen seen from five feet.
</P>
<P>
   People may be shocked by the prices of digital TV, Barry says,
``but if history is any guide, prices will come down fairly
rapidly.''

   ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT EDITORS:
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, no one had a video collection. No one
bought laserdiscs or DVDs _ these words did not exist. If someone
asked, ``What should we rent?'' he was talking about a car.
</P>
<P>
   Today 80 percent of the people who own color televisions also
own VCRs. Video has changed our entire relationship with film and
moving images onscreen _ and important aspects of our
off-the-screen lives as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a package of stories on ``25 Years of Video,'' The San
Francisco Chronicle examines the video age, assesses its influence
on our lives, looks ahead to the future of home viewing and
celebrates some of the best and worst movies available on tape. All
stories will move in the ``e'' entertainment category:
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-25YEARS (Undated) _ Twenty-five years after the first
videotapes were manufactured in this country, the medium has
permeated our lives, from how we watch movies to what we think
about celebrities to where our courtships unfold. By Mick LaSalle.
(950 words)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-FUTURE (Undated) _ The future of home video is here right
now, and it's digital. It's just that most people are not yet
plugged in. By Bob Graham. (790 words)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-ONLINE (Undated) _ It was inevitable, especially
considering the stay-at-home nature of video viewing, that video
sales would spread to Web sites. Here is a survey of online
marketers. By Edward Guthmann. (520 words)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-GENERATION (San Francisco) _ The influence of video may be
greatest on people born after 1975, who can't remember a time when
video didn't exist. Now they're putting their money into the medium
that has shaped their idea of entertainment. By Ruthe Stein. (650
words)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-TEACHING (Undated) _ From history and biography to music,
religion and poetry, specialized videos offer several college
degrees' worth of knowledge that one may glean while curled up on
the couch. By Peter Stack. (685 words)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-GOOD (Undated) _ They aren't necessarily the best movies
ever made, but they are particularly well suited to home viewing _
they don't lose a lot in the transition from big screen to little
one. Here are 25 great movies to watch on tape. (1120 words)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-BAD (Undated) _ The world of video is filled with guilty
pleasures. Here's one critic's sampling. By Mick LaSalle. (645

GENERATION V: BORN INTO THE VIDEO AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (with VIDEO-25YEARS-SFCHRON)  
 By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jacen Prete tore through the video section at
Virgin Megastore in downtown San Francisco. Within minutes he had
picked out a half dozen DVDs to buy, including ``The Exorcist,''
``Batman &AMP; Robin'' and ``Crash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I spend all my money,'' said Prete, a
23-year-old accountant, balancing his growing stack in two hands.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, he used his first paycheck to start a collection of
videos that has mushroomed into more than 1,000. Now he's in the
expensive process of replacing them with DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Videos have been around for a quarter of a century, which means
Prete's generation can't remember a time when they didn't exist _
much as earlier generations can't imagine what it was like not to
have a radio or television. People younger than 25 have been
referred to as the MTV generation, but they could just as well be
called the video generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone with my dad to rent videos as long as I can
remember. I know if there's a movie I miss, I can always catch it
on video,'' said Chris Lovos, 15, of Cupertino, Calif., who was
shopping for action movies at Virgin at the same time as Prete.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, 16-year-old Alice Pasto and her friend, Silvia Scarbini,
17, checked out a display of classic films. They were visiting from
Padua, Italy, where older American movies are hard to locate on
video.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find something we want, we don't mind carrying it
back,'' said Scarbini, picking up a copy of ``It Happened One
Night.'' The girls settled on ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``Doctor
Zhivago.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of video may be greatest on people born after
1975. Many seem to view the theatrical release of a movie as just
the first step to bringing it into their living room. Movies and
video have merged into one in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Take an offhand comment in a recent episode of ``The Sopranos,''
the hit HBO series. A young aspiring mafioso is trying his hand at
writing a movie script _ about the Mafia, of course. Discussing his
love of movies with a friend, he says, ``I get excited just walking
down the aisle at Blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   The generation born since the invention of video has put its
money into this new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frequent and valuable renter segment are those
between the ages of 18 and 34,'' said Robert Liuag, director of
research for the Video Software Dealers Association, a consortium
of video store owners and those who operate the home video division
of major studios.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers as a group haven't been surveyed because they're hard
to locate to interview, Liuag said. ``But we know kids are a big
component of our market.''
</P>
<P>
   That market has been consistently growing over the past 2 1/2
decades. According to a 1998 survey, the most recent statistics
available, nearly 70 percent of Americans rent a video at least
once a month.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage climbs to 78 when there is a child in the house.
``The presence of children in the household determines frequency of
renting and purchasing videos,'' Liuag said. ``People who have kids
tend to watch more videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Videos have become baby sitters for young children. VCRs give
parents more control over what their offspring are watching than
does television, with its multitude of channels.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of video has made children literate about
movies at a young age. Seven-year-olds can give a scene-by-scene
synopsis of the initial ``Star Wars'' movie. How this early and
frequent exposure to movies will influence them when they grow up
can only be guessed at.
</P>
<P>
   The first video generation already has been affected. It can't
be coincidence that every other creative young person these days
wants to be an independent filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Prete, for one, acknowledges that seeing so many movies on video
has gotten him thinking about becoming a screenwriter. ``I used to
just watch movies. But now I pay attention to how they're written
and really listen to the dialogue. I can stop the video and go back
and watch a scene again and again. And I think, `I could write
that.'''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Pacific Exchange Takes On New Wave of Competitors
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The Pacific Exchange has gotten caught up in the maelstrom of
change that is washing over the tradition-bound world of securities
exchanges around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's stock and options emporium is trying to find a
place for itself as computer technology increasingly takes over the
functions of the brokers and traders who haggle over securities on
exchange floors.
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of digital competitors called electronic
communications networks is directly matching buyers and sellers of
stock, and could soon bypass the existing exchanges altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Similar rivals are emerging in the options business. Within a
year or so, electronic exchanges will open for business in
competition with floor-based options marts such as Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, competitive pressures have touched off an
old-fashioned donnybrook among securities exchanges anxious to
ensure their survival as the ground shifts underneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, wholesale warfare erupted among U.S. exchanges
after the market leader in options, the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, said it would begin trading Dell Computer options,
formerly the sole turf of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. That
threatened to unravel the gentlemen's agreement that gave different
exchanges the privilege to trade exclusively the options of
specific companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pacific Exchange, it's fallen to a new chief, Philip
DeFeo, a 53-year-old New Yorker installed as chairman and CEO just
21/2 months ago, to navigate through these shoals.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo was president and chief executive of Van Eck Associates
Group, a New York fund company with $1.5 billion in assets that
specializes in commodities and international stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's CEO is a music lover who relaxes at home by playing
the clarinet. A mustachioed grin and jovial manner belie his
hardheaded, decisive executive style, associates say. He says it
will take dramatic action to keep the exchange healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a world where our competitors are not just other
exchanges, but entrepreneurial companies that are continuously  &LR; 
 &LR; changing,'' he noted. ``The marketplace around us puts us in a
position where we have to reinvent ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say DeFeo must make two decisions quickly: What market
niche should the Pacific Exchange carve out for itself as
electronic technology gains ground? And what kind of organizational
structure will best allow it to compete?
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost overnight, the dynamics of the Pacific Exchange's
business have changed,'' said Don Putnam, managing director of
Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, a San Francisco investment
bank that specializes in brokerage and money-management firms.
``DeFeo has got a very short period of time to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The 117-old Pacific Exchange is the third-largest options
exchange in the nation, but a minor player in stock trading. On
average, 17 million shares of stock and 271,000 options contracts
change hands daily on Pacific's trading floors.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange is structured as an association whose 552 members
hold seats entitling them to trade stocks and options, and vote on
major policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific is the only exchange that trades options of such
companies as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, and its business, at
least for now, is thriving. Despite banks of computers that process
orders, frenzied traders still crowd around ``pits,'' gesturing as
they shout ``buy'' and ``sell'' offers.
</P>
<P>
   Business is not as robust in stock trading. Dwarfed by giant,
well-heeled rivals such as the New York Stock Exchange and the
Nasdaq Stock Market, Pacific's equity operation is losing market
share and hemorrhaging cash.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, under retired CEO Robert Greber, the exchange struck
a merger deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange. But the
Chicago exchange backed out, explaining that it needed to focus its
energy on countering electronic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Left in the lurch, Pacific cobbled together a go-it-alone
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It adopted a series of measures to make its stock business
profitable, including a plan to close equity trading floors in San
Francisco and Los Angeles, and have electronically linked brokers
work from their own offices instead. Most observers viewed the
moves as preparations to spin stock trading off on its own, sell it
or shut it down altogether.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the exchange sought a joint-venture partner
capable of providing the advanced technology the exchange needed to
stay competitive. By the time DeFeo arrived in June, Pacific had
nearly reached an agreement with New York broker Cantor Fitzgerald
to start an advanced computer-based options trading system.
</P>
<P>
   The new CEO faced a competitive landscape that was changing on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   To gird for battle and make themselves more nimble, the NYSE and
Nasdaq both announced plans to junk their membership structures and
reorganize as for-profit, publicly held corporations. In options
trading, a shifting series of alliances and mergers was remaking
the business.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, DeFeo said it was too early for him
to show his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm new here, I want to be careful and cautious about
taking actions that have long-term effects,'' he noted. All the
same, he said, '`I have a preliminary assessment of where we ought
to go.`` One indication of DeFeo's thinking was the exchange's
recent move to reorganize its stock-trading business as a
for-profit subsidiary, similar to the proposals NYSE and Nasdaq
have made.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange members have said that could be a model for
restructuring the options business, too, by letting seat holders
swap membership for stock in a new corporation. ``We need to speed
up our decision-making processes,'' DeFeo said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stock business, DeFeo thinks it could become a
moneymaker again. ``It's been buried before its time,'' he said. He
is even reconsidering the decision to close the San Francisco
equity trading floor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the joint venture with Cantor Fitzgerald appears
dead. People close to Pacific said the New York broker demanded too
much control over the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said he is still considering potential alliances, but he
is not convinced such a partnership is essential. He insisted the
exchange doesn't need outside help to modernize its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he stressed, Pacific has plenty to offer a
potential partner. Its status as a regulated exchange recognized by
the Securities and Exchange Commission would be valuable to a
potential partner because it provides important formal protections
and controls to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he prepares to remake the institution he heads, DeFeo
must walk on tiptoes. That's because Pacific membership structure
requires consensus and is not suited for quick, dramatic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, adopting electronic technology could cut
commissions and take business from the wholesale brokers who hold
seats on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exchanges have historically been run for the benefit of their
members,'' said Junius Peake,cq &LR;  a finance professor at the
University of Northern Colorado. ``If bank tellers had run banks,
how many ATMs would we have?``
</P>
<P>
   The fact that exchanges around the world are in turmoil helps
DeFeo. ``There's a clearer sense of urgency here,'' said exchange
spokesman Dale Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wooing the members is a delicate task requiring great
political skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The membership and board had been unwilling to move faster,''
said Warren Langley, who stepped down as the exchange's No.2
executive earlier this year. ``But bringing in someone new lets you
break the mold.''

TWENTY-FIVE GREAT FILMS FOR HOME VIEWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (with VIDEO-25YEARS-SFCHRON)  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In honor of the silver anniversary of video, The Chronicle's
movie staff has put together a list of 25 great movies to watch on
tape. These aren't necessarily the best movies ever made, but they
are particularly well suited to home viewing _ they don't lose a
lot in the transition from big screen to little one.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``All About Eve'' (1950): &LR;  Bette Davis as fading star Margo
Channing had better look over her shoulder at deceptively sweet,
ambitious Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington. George Sanders as the
vinegary Broadway critic is not deceived, and there's never a dull
moment.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Breaking Away'' (1979): &LR;  For a bicycling nut, this is
absolutely the best movie ever made about the passion for
two-wheeling. It's a charmer as a coming-of-age story.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``The Bitter Tea of General Yen'' (1933): &LR;  The tall Swedish
actor Nils Asther, believe it or not, is convincing as the title
character, a Chinese warlord, and Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who
falls in love with him in this atmospheric Frank Capra film.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Driving Miss Daisy'' (1989): &LR;  Jessica Tandy and Morgan
Freeman are superb artists, and their pas de deux here as a starchy
Southern matron and her African American chauffeur should be
required viewing for acting students everywhere. It's a dream to
behold.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' (1986): &LR;  Director John Hughes
never topped this comedy that made Matthew Broderick the coolest
guy around. On video, it's wonderful brainless entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``The French Connection'' (1971): &LR;  This great humanistic cop
movie _ with perhaps the best chase scene ever _ has a visceral
energy and wise-guy intimacy on video. Poppy Doyle was far ahead of
Andy Sipowitz on ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``How Green Was My Valley'' (1941): &LR;  John Ford's saga about
a Welsh mining town and one family's travails is a model of vintage
Hollywood filmmaking. The actors, including Donald Crisp, Maureen
O'Hara and Roddy McDowall, are wonderful, the sets astonishingly
realistic and the elegiac tone never turns gooey.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``The Last Tycoon'' (1976): &LR;  Though not everyone's cup of
tea, Harold Pinter's moody adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's
last, unfinished novel is both a stark character portrait and a
somber evocation of Hollywood in the 1930s. It stars Robert De
Niro, in one of his best performances, as an Irving Thalberg-like
producer. Elia Kazan directed.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Laura'' (1944): &LR;  Falling in love with a dead person never
seemed more appealing than it does in this terrific film noir. Gene
Tierney is the haunting ghost, Dana Andrews the detective who falls
for her while investigating her death. Also boasts Clifton Webb at
his drollest and one of the best theme songs ever composed for a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Lolita'' (1962): &LR;  Some think they should have called this
Stanley Kubrick adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel ``Quilty''
for Peter Sellers' many-faced dominance of the action, but who's
complaining? James Mason is perfection as the self-deluded
professor in the thrall of teenage Sue Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Maurice'' (1987): &LR;  This Merchant-Ivory production of E.M.
Forster's class-conscious novel, published posthumously, is one of
those films that keeps getting better on repeated viewings. Hugh
Grant is left wondering if he should have rebuffed aristocratic
friend James Wilby, who is much better off with gamekeeper Rupert
Graves.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``My Fair Lady'' (1964): &LR;  Those who think Julie Andrews was
robbed need to see Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle again; it's
her best performance. Repeated viewings bring out the continuing
delights of Stanley Holloway's turn as her father and Rex
Harrison's as Professor Henry Higgins, the role he owned. Still the
best movie version of a great stage musical.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``The Postman Always Rings Twice'' (1946): &LR;  Footloose John
Garfield is stopped in his tracks by the ultimate femme fatale,
Lana Turner, as blond as blond ever gets.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Remember the Night'' (1940): &LR;  Barbara Stanwyck is a
shoplifter and Fred MacMurray the prosecutor who brings her home
for Christmas in this little-known gem from director Mitchell
Leisen and screenwriter Preston Sturges. Beulah Bondi plays
MacMurray's mother and Elizabeth Patterson is his old-maid aunt.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``The River Wild'' (1994): &LR;  For a film shot entirely in the
vast outdoors, this one plays terrifically on the small screen.
It's a harrowing mix of whitewater action and evil, with Meryl
Streep as a macho mom.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Roman Holiday'' (1953): &LR;  The screenwriters of ``Notting
Hill'' were obviously inspired by this fairy-tale romance. But the
pairing of Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck can't be matched. The
ending breaks your heart at every viewing.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Savage Nights'' (1993): &LR;  French novelist Cyril Collard was
suffering from AIDS when he wrote, directed and starred in this
film, an adaptation of his novel about a promiscuous bisexual
suffering from AIDS. A shattering picture about sex and death, rage
and futility, about trying vainly to hold on to the moment. In
French with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Say Anything'' (1989): &LR;  One of the great teen romance
movies, too often overlooked. It's the best of John Cusack, and a
nearly perfect video flick.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946): &LR;  Kirk Douglas
made his screen debut in this offbeat melodrama, and he has star
written all over him. Barbara Stanwyck gets to make love to him _
and she gets a great wardrobe to boot. Irresistible.

RATING THE ONLINE VIDEO SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (with VIDEO-25YEARS-SFCHRON)  
 By EDWARD GUTHMANN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no secret that e-commerce is reshaping our culture and the
way we purchase goods. We buy appliances, books and CDs online,
find lovers online, unload unwanted belongings online and shop for
the best schools for our children online.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable, then _ especially considering the
stay-at-home nature of many video hounds _ that cassette and DVD
sales would spread from retail outlets to a new crop of Web sites.
Without overhead costs, the Web sites peddle the same titles as
stores, but usually at lower prices, and with greater selection.
</P>
<P>
   We surveyed online marketers and did comparison shopping on two
films: last year's box-office smash ``There's Something About
Mary'' and a best-picture Oscar winner from 50 years ago, ``All the
King's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com, the Berkeley, Calif., video seller, has the lowest tag
on ``Mary'': $13.99 for a VHS copy, compared with $16.99 at most
sites. Its DVD version of the gross-out comedy is an even bigger
bargain: $17.49, next to the more typical $27.98.
</P>
<P>
   Every site has its loss leaders. Tower Records' Web site
undersells the competitors on ``All the King's Men,'' with a $13.99
sticker price for VHS, $27.99 for DVD.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget eBay, the online swap meet/auction house.
Bidding prices start at $9.99 for a new, sealed copy of ``Mary,''
while another peddler lists ``All the King's Men'' at $7.01.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; Amazon.com: &LR;  This online giant _ known for bargains, breadth
of choice and speedy delivery _ pushes its video line just as
aggressively as its books. Example: The DVD of ``Titanic,'' due
August 31, is half-priced at $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of information here: For every video title, Amazon
offers a synopsis or general description and posts lengthy reviews
from viewers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; bigstar.com: &LR;  This site bills itself as a ``movie
superstore'' with 100,000 listings for videocassettes, DVDs and
laserdiscs. Browsing is a bit frustrating: The site is overcrowded,
resembling a print tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; blockbuster.com: &LR;  So you hate the fluorescent glare of
Blockbuster's ugly, cookie-cutter stores. Spare yourself and shop
online.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; DVD Express &LR;  (dvdexpress.com): Viewers can save up to 50
percent at this online emporium, which offers same-day shipping and
claims to have the biggest selection of DVDs anywhere. Contests and
giveaways are frequent, and the site also sells movie merchandise.
DVD titles can also be preordered before the films are out of
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Reel.com &LR;  This Berkeley firm also has a retail store but does
the bulk of its business on this Web site, offering discounts up to
40 percent and special sections on kids' movies, Oscar winners and
editors' picks. The site is attractive, with clean, uncluttered
graphics and fun features like the ``Movie Anatomy'' chart that
rates each title on the basis of action, drama, humor, sex,
violence, suspense and offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Tower Records  &LR; (towerrecords.com): The retail chain offers
400,000 music and video titles on this site and gilds the lily with
contests, half a million songs to sample, a music magazine and
overnight delivery. The site, which emphasizes music over videos,
has a cluttered look.

 UNDATED: to boot. Irresistible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``To Each His Own'' (1946): &LR;  Olivia de Havilland has an
illicit affair and pays for her indiscretion. A bit of a soap
opera, but still compulsive watching. De Havilland's character
turns out to be an independent woman at a time when that was pretty
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1962): &LR;  Harper Lee's novel of
racial intolerance and a child's awakening is perfectly realized in
this Robert Mulligan drama, starring Gregory Peck as the widowed
Southern attorney Atticus Finch. The film's graceful rhythm, modest
physical scale and emphasis on character and dialogue are all well
suited to home viewing.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Two for the Road'' (1967): &LR;  Audrey Hepburn and Albert
Finney fall in and out of love in what may be the smartest movie
ever made about marriage. Should be obligatory viewing for couples
every few years.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``An Unmarried Woman'' (1978): &LR;  Very few movies in the past
40 years have been love poems to the beauty and resiliency of
American womanhood, but this Paul Mazursky film is one of them. The
film's unsentimental look at sex and romance from a woman's point
of view has aged well, and Jill Clayburgh gives a career-defining
performance.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``Viva Las Vegas'' (1964): &LR;  This Elvis Presley movie is a
pillar of '60s kitsch. A writhing, shaking Ann-Margret is Elvis'
best co-star ever, and the movie has a breezy, just-for-pleasure
rhythm that makes for ideal TV viewing.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &UR; ``War and Peace'' (1968): &LR;  Sergei Bondarchuk directed and
stars (as Pierre) in this towering cinematic masterpiece _ a 6
1/2-hour version of Tolstoy's mammoth novel. Don't think of it as a
movie. Think of it as the ultimate miniseries to be watched over
the course of three or four nights.

WE KNOW WHAT WE LIKE: GUILTY PLEASURES ON VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (with VIDEO-25YEARS-SFCHRON)  
 By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of video is filled with guilty pleasures. These come
in two varieties: 1) movies that we know are bad but like anyway;
and 2) movies that appeal to us on a gut level that has little to
do with quality.
</P>
<P>
   The gut-level appeal can be one of titillation or perverse
amusement. Funny dramas, hideous love stories and the lowest of low
comedies have appeal. What follows are 10 guilty pleasures from a
variety of genres. The nice thing about these films is that, unlike
good movies, whose appeal fades with repeated viewings, a guilty
pleasure is a joy forever.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Beverly Hills Ninja'' (1997): &LR;  This is the best film from
the late comedian Chris Farley. It's not to be watched for the
story line about a clumsy white guy who tries to become a Ninja
master. It needs to be seen for Farley's physical shtick, which was
as vulgar and flamboyant as the Three Stooges'.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Cracking Up'' (1983): &LR;  Jerry Lewis plays a neurotic who
seeks psychiatric help in this bizarre comedy that is funny for the
right reasons _ and for the wrong reasons. Lewis stretches each
joke to the breaking point, then extends it further, until it
becomes funny again. One example: He walks onto a slippery floor
and keeps falling down.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Devil in the Flesh'' (1987): &LR;  This art film/sex movie isn't
a guilty pleasure for its titillation, which is minimal. It's a
perverse pleasure for director Marco Bellocchio's relentless
fascination with Maruschka Detmers, a pretty but unremarkable
actress whom he photographs as the ultimate example of allure _
until it becomes ridiculous. The picture was a scandal in its time
because it was the first ``serious'' art film to include a graphic
scene of fellatio.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Godfather III'' (1990): &LR;  This is a good movie despite an
incomprehensible plot. What makes this film a guilty pleasure is
that it can be enjoyed solely for the performance of Sofia Coppola
as Michael Corleone's spoiled daughter. The climactic moment, in
which she is shot and says, ``Dad?'' is one of recent cinema's
great unintentional hoots.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; ``The Harrad Experiment'' (1973): &LR;  This film, about a college
in which students learn about sexual relations, has wall-to-wall
nudity, yet it's about as sexy as ``Schindler's List.''
Then-unknown actors Don Johnson and Bruno Kirby get fully,
frontally naked in this amazing time capsule _ a complete immersion
in '60s-style psychobabble.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``High School High'' (1996): &LR;  Jon Lovitz stars in this
delightfully stupid parody of the ``To Sir, With Love''
teacher-as-saint genre. Highlights include the scene in which two
prim students do an X-rated dance at a high school social.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Mirror Has Two Faces'' (1996): &LR;  This is a terrible
film, but it's enjoyable for perverse reasons. Barbra Streisand
plays a plain college professor who undergoes a beauty makeover
that makes her look like an over-the-hill call girl. From then on
everyone swoons over her, probably because Streisand directed the
film. This is a clueless vanity piece, the product of both
grandiosity and insecurity. It is an embarrassment, and so awful
it's hard not to watch.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Naked Killer'' (1993): &LR;  Lesbian assassins do battle against
a pair of heterosexual female assassins in this sexy and demented
Hong Kong thriller in which the women are lethal and the men are
spineless and pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Showgirls'' (1995): &LR;  This movie boggles the mind. Viewers
will tie themselves into knots trying to imagine how director Paul
Verhoeven and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas expected anyone to take it
seriously _ or how Elizabeth Berkley expected to become a star by
licking her own nipples. Beware: Stay away from the R-rated
version. This film must be seen in all its NC-17 glory.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Torch Song'' (1953): &LR;  Joan Crawford is tougher than any man
in this bizarre film about a hard-as-nails Broadway star and her
romance with a blind pianist (Michael Wilding). In the case of
Crawford, the blindness helps. Crawford's appeal is elusive, to say
the least, but that's what makes the film fascinating _ not to
mention the scene of her onstage performing in blackface. You won't
believe your eyes.

FAST-FORWARD TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (with VIDEO-25YEARS-SFCHRON)  
 By PETER STACK  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With thousands of videos on history, science, nature, how to
make things, concert performances, music instruction, criticism,
poetry, fine arts, religion, personal growth, transportation,
health, politics and parenting, a person could earn several college
degrees' worth of knowledge while curled up on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, feature films still dominate home viewing, accounting
for more than 90 percent. But a lot of educational programming on
video is fascinating and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   History? There are hundreds of video accounts, from the
scholarly, five-tape ``Charlemagne'' ($90) to the ``American Women
of Achievement Video Collection'' ($400), with inspiring profiles
of Jane Addams, Emily Dickinson, Amelia Earhart and Sandra Day
O'Connor, among others.
</P>
<P>
   One question that always arises with specialized home video is
where to get the goods. It's not as hard as many think.
</P>
<P>
   Public libraries usually have a good stock of educational and
documentary programming. Perhaps the best source in Northern
California is the San Francisco Public Library (main branch is on
Larkin Street between Grove and Fulton streets; call (415)
557-4400). The big advantage there is that tapes circulate for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Try video dealers, too. A good store should have some basics _
those terrific National Geographic nature programs, for example.
But video dealers are also willing to share catalog information and
order videos for customers.
</P>
<P>
   A surefire source is the nation's largest mail-order video
rental and sales firm, Facets Video (1517 W. Fullerton Ave.,
Chicago, IL 60614. Call (800) 331-6197). The Facets catalog is vast
and the folks there are very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Other sources are gift shops at museums, nature centers,
zoos, aquariums. Music and record stores stock programs on how to
play instruments. Check theater bookstores for drama videos,
hardware stores for tapes dealing with construction methods.
Sporting-goods retailers often sell videos _ a way of getting their
customers stoked about skiing, mountaineering or kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Here are some suggestions for history buffs: A fine, populist
U.S. history is ``Ken Burns' America'' (about $90). There are
superb videos on historic speeches (``Great American Speeches,''
``The Speeches Collection''), and there are dozens of riveting
videos about World War II (``World at War'' is a fascinating
overview in 26 volumes; $20 per tape), Vietnam (including the CBS
seven-volume series ``Vietnam''), World War I and the Civil War.
The Smithsonian Institution's ``Great Battles of the Civil War'' in
seven volumes ($30 each) is memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians of North America'' is one of the most extensive
filmic overviews of native cultures ever made. It looks at 20
tribes (about $40 per cassette; also available in 10-volume sets).
</P>
<P>
   There are histories of Africa, Europe and the ancient worlds of
Greece, Egypt and Asia. Dozens of tapes are available on world
religions, scores on biblical subjects alone. Check out the
fascinating series ``According to Kossoff,'' featuring biblical
scholar David Kossoff telling Old Testament stories.
</P>
<P>
   Biographies are a major source of pleasure. Great portraits of
baseball players, presidents, inventors, poets, filmmakers,
painters, criminals and statesmen are available. Some titles: ``The
Complete Churchill'' (four parts, $60), ``Patton: A Genius for
War'' ($20), ``FDR'' (four-tape boxed set, $70), ``Houdini'' ($20),
``Jim Thorpe _ All American'' ($20), ``P.T. Barnum: World's
Greatest Showman'' ($20), ``Thomas Jefferson: Philosopher of
Freedom'' ($20) and ``You're the Top _ The Cole Porter Story''
($20).
</P>
<P>
   In sheer volume, music, dance and fine arts videos outnumber all
other specialty programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the visual arts, entire critical surveys are contained in
programs such as the ``Impressionism Box Set'' ($80), the 10-volume
PBS survey ``Art of the Western World'' ($100 per tape) and several
excellent video collections from the Metropolitan Museum, the
Whitney Museum, the Louvre and the Hermitage. The ``Metropolitan
Museum Box Set'' ($80), three tapes showing and discussing the
museum's collection, is outstanding. And don't forget those
amusing, insightful Sister Wendy surveys.
</P>
<P>
   If you start feeling numb from too much couch time, there are at
least a dozen tapes by health experts on back care.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although exact figures are difficult to obtain, there's no
question that adult video is big business.
</P>
<P>
   Adult Video News, a trade magazine, claims the genre has a 19
percent share of the entire video market, but the number is tricky
because there is no exact definition of ``adult video.'' What is
clear is that flesh-film distributors gained an immediate foothold
when the home video revolution began in the 1980s, because home is
where the privacy is.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet is eroding the video scene, but there's still a
steady supply of product. And DVD, with its clearer picture and
potential for multiple camera angles, is making inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Argument rages over what adult video is. To many people, it
seems to include everything from the relatively tame,
market-dominating Playboy Home Video line to a current crop of
hard-core, made-for-video films that redefine the concept of
raunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own niche, our own category,'' said Barry Leshtz,
senior vice president and general manager of Playboy Home Video.
``We don't consider ourselves adult video, per se, though we are
adult in content. We're very mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, specializing in naked women and a relatively new Eros
series of ``sensual'' feature films, has no fewer than three big
titles on Billboard magazine's top-selling videos chart _
``Playboy's Celebrities,'' featuring Pamela Anderson Lee, Carmen
Electra, Jenny McCarthy, Dian Parkinson and others; ``Playboy's Hot
City Girls''; and ``Playboy's 1999 Playmate of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't show explicit sex,'' Leshtz said. ``The concept we
follow is that we're showing beautiful people enjoying eroticism
and sensuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is ``girl on girl'' action, as the trade calls it.
Playboy has made significant inroads in attracting couples _ the
company produced a popular tape called ``Playboy's Couples'' _ and
an increasing number of women as video buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that a lot of decisions about home entertainment
are made by females, and women generally feel comfortable knowing
we don't show violence, S&AMP;M, bestiality or things that would be
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival Penthouse is more explicit. Current top sellers for
Penthouse, ``Sun, Surf and Centerfolds'' and ``Girls of the
Zodiac,'' are far racier but stop short of explicit sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hard-core titles has skyrocketed in the 1990s,
from about 1,300 to last year's record 9,000. Dozens of producers
churn out a vast range of adult fare catering to every taste,
fetish and gender. The chart-topping rental this month is a John
Leslie production, ``Fresh Meat 7,'' part of a continuing series,
while first in direct sales is Seymore Inc.'s ``Tushy, Anyone?''

SMALL COMPANIES GRAPPLE WITH HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Larry Shandy flinched at the voice mail
message he received when he walked into his small, tidy office the
morning of July 19.
</P>
<P>
   The voice on the recording said Shandy's company, Kansas
City-based CPS Distributors Inc., was facing a 14 percent rate
increase on its health insurance premiums. The company has about 35
employees here and five in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again,'' Shandy muttered to himself, disgustedly.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't surprised. Shandy said CPS, which distributes
audio electronics such as car and boat stereos, had gone through
many health insurers in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really frustrated, because it's really getting old,'' he
said. ``They come to me with these great quotes and the next year
we get tremendous increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandy's not alone. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says small
businesses got socked with an average premium increase of 19
percent last year, compared with an average increase for all
businesses of 7 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many small-business owners feel they must provide health
insurance to attract qualified employees in an extraordinarily
tight labor market. Besides a strong economy, competition for
employees in the Kansas City area has been revved up by attractive
benefit packages offered by casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Some small-business owners feel compelled to drop coverage when
their premiums jump. Others grit their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm being gored, but I'm getting used to it,''
said Jim Bichelmeyer, co-owner of Bichelmeyer Meats, a Kansas City,
Kan., firm with 12 employees. ``It's another cost of doing business
and we have to count on the cost going up 10 percent to 20 percent
every year. You just wonder when ... it's going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Others turn to group plans designed for small businesses, such
as ChamberCHOICE, a program endorsed by the Greater Kansas City
Chamber of Commerce and operated by Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Chamber of Commerce said recently that it is
putting together a program to help small businesses offer health
insurance to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kansas, small businesses can apply for tax credits to
offset the cost of providing health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The various programs aim to address overwhelming economic
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of small businesses compiled earlier this year, the
U.S. Chamber found that 81 percent of respondents cited the cost of
health care or insurance as a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 percent of respondents who said they did not offer
health insurance, more than half said they probably would offer it
if it were more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   In a May survey of small businesses conducted by the Missouri
Chamber, one-third of the responding companies said they offered
their employees no medical benefits. Of those, three out of four
cited cost as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   And while small-business owners may want to provide health
benefits to their workers, experts say small businesses lack the
purchasing power of big companies to negotiate lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small employers just don't have the leverage to attract
competitive pricing,'' said Daniel P. Mehan, the Missouri Chamber's
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, small-business owners may have to choose between
giving their employees health benefits or bigger paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that small businesses offer a smaller pool of
individuals for an insurer to spread risk over. Don Brain, a
health-care consultant and president of Corporate Benefits
Consulting Group in Overland Park, said some small businesses see
their rates jump because one employee has a controllable health
condition such as high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating costs are squeezing some small businesses out of
the health insurance market, Brain said.
</P>
<P>
   CPS provides its employees with health insurance through United
HealthCare of the Midwest Inc. Under the proposed 14 percent rate
increase, the company's premium payments would have gone from
$120.65 to $137.54 a month for each employee. The total annual
premium cost to the company would have risen from about $58,000 to
$66,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shandy, the CPS president, said CPS looked at about 12 other
bids and ultimately chose an offer from United for a less extensive
health plan for $123.79 a month per employee, bringing the
company's annual premium costs to about $59,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shandy said he isn't thrilled with the outcome, but feels it's
the best he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't want to switch (insurance companies),'' Shandy
said. ``You have to requalify everybody. Some of the people
wouldn't be able to use the same doctors or hospitals. And even
when an insurance company gives you a quote, you may not get it for
that price after they check everyone's health history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bichelmeyer, whose business also gets health insurance through
United, said the meat company's premium rate jumped 18 percent last
March.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Tracy, vice president of sales and marketing in United's
Overland Park, Kan., office, said United and other insurers are not
trying to squeeze their small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tracy said United and its competitors must raise rates
to a level that will cover higher use of health services and higher
costs for those services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to see increases in prescription drug usage and
the cost to provide those drugs, as well as in outpatient services
and additional costs resulting from recent government mandates,''
Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   Such mandates include greater coverage for emergency room visits
and requirements to provide coverage for people in poor health,
Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side to it is we are taking as many steps as we can
to put products and plan designs into the marketplace that allow
the small employer to have more choice and still protect their
employees,'' Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association
of America in Washington, said the industry group agrees that it
can be tough for small businesses to obtain health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Coorsh said the association has proposed tax incentives to help
small businesses that do provide coverage. It also has recommended
other measures, such as widening the availability of medical
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   One option for small businesses is the ChamberCHOICE program,
which began in 1994 and now covers more than 4,200 businesses.
Participants may choose a health maintenance organization (HMO),
preferred provider organization (PPO) or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs and PPOs are both forms of managed care, but HMOs are
stricter in their control of access to care.
</P>
<P>
   ChamberCHOICE offers small businesses price stability, said
Roger Foreman, a Blue Cross senior vice president who oversees the
program. Members saw an average premium increase of 8 percent this
year and can expect about the same in 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ChamberCHOICE currently serves businesses with fewer than 25
employees, but will expand in October to include those with up to
49 employees, Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the businesses participating in ChamberCHOICE is Oz
Accommodations Inc., a rental home and apartment finder based in
Lenexa, Kan. The company has 15 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are plans out there that are less expensive,
but we feel that for the service we get it's worth the money,''
said Marlene Abbey, Oz founder and co-owner. ``Being able to offer
a good insurance package attracts excellent employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Missouri Chamber's plan calls for a statewide
health insurance purchasing cooperative that would offer small
companies more choices and purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated launch date is January. Preliminary plans are to
offer the program through local insurance agents and to involve
local chambers of commerce in the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stumpf, an independent insurance agent who represents
ChamberCHOICE, said virtually any small business can obtain some
type of health coverage for its employees if it considers all the
options.
</P>
<P>
   The plan they end up with may not be a ``Mercedes,'' but
``certainly a workable plan that protects against catastrophic
claims,'' he said.

ALTHOUGH FEDERAL APPROVAL WAS WITHDRAWN, INDIAN CASINO PLAN ISN'T
DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Plans for a tribal casino in Miami County,
Kan., aren't dead yet.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Interior Department late Friday informed Kansas Gov.
Bill Graves it had withdrawn approval for the gambling hall,
proposed by the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma for 35 acres near La Cygne
Lake, about 45 miles south of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But in a more detailed letter Friday to tribal officials, the
government explained that it had acted on technical grounds only
and encouraged the tribe to begin the process again.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' office, which also received the tribal letter, released
copies Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Les Cusher, executive director of the Miami Tribe, said Monday
that the tribe's attorneys were reviewing the matter and that it
was undecided about its next step.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has signed casino pacts with four indigenous tribes that
reside on reservations in the state. But the state has resisted the
Miami Tribe's casino plan, saying the site is not within a bona
fide tribal reservation.
</P>
<P>
   After years of litigation against Kansas and others, the Miami
Tribe last year won various court and federal agency rulings
declaring the site was eligible for casino gambling according to
the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, even though the tribe had
relinquished the land more than 120 years ago when it migrated to
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In an administrative ruling last year that is being challenged
by the state in federal court, the Interior Department declared
that the land had requalified as reservation since 1996, when the
tribe accepted its current owners as full tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   However, that strategic move came after the tribe had first
approached the state in 1992 about a casino and had been rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department rules _ also under challenge by Kansas and
other states _ empower the agency as a last resort to approve and
license casinos when tribes and their state governments are unable
to negotiate mutually acceptable tribal gambling agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Interior was moving toward issuing such a license to the tribe
when the state sued last month.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to the tribe, the Interior Department reversed its
position and agreed with the state, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state had no duty to enter into such negotiations (in
1992) because the Miami Tribe had no claim to jurisdiction over any
Indian lands within the state,'' the government said. Those facts
voided Interior's intervention in the case, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the (Miami County land) is now recognized as Indian
lands,'' the letter concluded, ``we encourage the Miami Tribe to
seek negotiations with the state of Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Graves would not open talks with the tribe
until all legal matters are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Graves wants a judge to weigh in on the reservation
land issue,'' said spokesman Mike Matson. ``Until then, everything
else is a nonstarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also wants a final judicial determination of the
status of the land, said Interior Department spokeswoman Stephanie
Hanna.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are also hopeful the tribe and the state would begin to
negotiate an amicable and voluntary compact,'' she said Monday.

THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE BRINGS ETHNIC ALBANIANS TO KANSAS CITY
COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two years ago, Mrika Tahiri spent her first
week of college in Kosovo facing down police who fired tear gas at
a student protest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She limped away with a gash on her leg. Other classmates were
badly injured. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is why Tahiri, 21, couldn't help but shake her head at the
contrast between that ordeal and her first week at Rockhurst
University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the university's quadrangle, students horsed around, smiles
on their tanned faces as they shared stories from summer vacation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here and everyone is having fun. Everyone is so
happy,'' she said Monday. ``I was like, `What is this?' We're not
used to that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri is one of nine ethnic Albanians attending Rockhurst
through Project Concern, which has placed about 45 students at 22
colleges. Rockhurst, which accepted the most students, is providing
tuition, room and board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College life is carefree for many students. But Tahiri and other
students from Kosovo say that for them, university life has been a
painful experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the government took over Pristina University in
Kosovo. Students were evicted from dormitories, and teachers were
barred from classrooms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the education didn't stop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Professors taught classes in cramped basements of private homes.
Students had no desks. Many classmates fled the country
altogether. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave up,'' said Kole Krasniqi, 19. ``They continued
to keep up the lessons. We continued to try to learn.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic conflict worsened this year when NATO began bombing
Yugoslavia. That caused the Serbs to tighten the screws against
ethnic Albanians, who make up the majority in Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri remembers eating dinner and hearing the first bombs
drop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh my God, my life is about to change,' '' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri and Krasniqi fled for the border, becoming separated from
family and friends. Both ended up in refugee camps in Macedonia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri arrived with less than $20. Krasniqi's stay was equally
miserable _ he often waited two hours to brush his teeth from a
rocky spring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Tahiri's last memories of the camps was seeing a former
professor whose face was bruised from a police beating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both students contacted relatives in America and reached New
York in June. Both wanted to return to college but didn't know
how. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Carol Detweiler of Oneonta, N.Y., was watching
news footage of the refugees' plight. With the help of her husband,
who is president of Hartwick College, she started Project Concern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detweiler solicited interest from colleges across the country,
including Rockhurst. About 145 refugees applied for scholarships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detweiler hopes the program will address Kosovo's ``brain
drain,'' in which thousands of professionals fled the province
during the conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``After a war like this, to build a country back up, you need to
have educated people,'' she said. ``My hope is that some of these
young people will go back home and be the future of their own
country.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosita McCoy, a university spokeswoman, said playing host to the
Kosovar students is consistent with Rockhurst's mission to help the
less fortunate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She hopes their presence will benefit American students, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll bring a new perspective to our classes and add
diversity to our student population,'' McCoy said. ``They've
actually lived something that was a critical period in world
history.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, Tahiri and Krasniqi are adapting to their new country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri's cropped blonde hair and Krasniqi's high-top Adidas
sneakers already blend right into American college fashion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are looking forward to the start of classes on Wednesday.
Tahiri plans to study pharmacy, Krasniqi is pursuing a dental
career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although they only arrived in Kansas City last week, the
students already are dealing with the staples of college life:
parties, long lines for registration and frightening cafeteria
food. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri said her classmates' eyes light up when they hear she is
from Kosovo. ``They can't wait to hear about it,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are dealing with cultural differences, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many classmates turn their dormitory rooms into an electronics
store display: VCRs, televisions, video games stacked eye-high. The
Kosovar students feel self-conscious because they have only a few
bags of possessions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And although Tahiri's English is polished, she still is
deciphering the nuances of American slang. She was stumped when her
query of ``What's up?'' was met with the reply: ``Just chillin'.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It also took students awhile to feel comfortable asking campus
police for escorts. In Kosovo, an encounter with police often
resulted in beatings or other abuse, Krasniqi said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You never approached the police. You tried to avoid them,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both students hope to put the loneliness and bad memories out of
their minds once classes start. It isn't easy contacting relatives
left behind. Krasniqi's family must travel more than 74 miles to
Pristina to call him because phone service still is out in his
hometown of Peja. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first, both Tahiri and Krasniqi dreamed of returning home one
day just as Detweiler, the program's founder, hoped they would. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say they cannot imagine returning to a country where
towns have been leveled, relatives displaced and friends
traumatized. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The life I knew has ended. It's over,'' Tahiri said. ``I'm
trying to continue it here. This is a new start. I can't wait.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ If Mack Brown could use a remote control to operate his
defense, the first button he would push would be the one marked
``volume.'' The energetic Texas head coach, who is never at a loss
for words, has a high-energy defense filled with soft-spoken
players.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From 300-plus-pound junior linemen Casey Hampton and Shaun
Rogers to lead-by-example linebackers Anthony Hicks and De'Andre
Lewis to quick and quiet defensive backs Joe Walker and Ervis Hill,
most of the UT defenders prefer to let their play speak for them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Longhorns take the field Saturday against North
Carolina State, they hope their play will deliver a more positive
message than it did in last year's season opener, a 66-36 win over
New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they expect it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we are better,'' said Lewis, a sophomore who started
all 12 games last season. ``Last year we didn't really know what we
had; now we know. Now that we know that we have the best coaching
staff in America, we know that if we just buy into what they say,
everything will work out well. That's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said this year's defense will enter the season looking for
an emotional leader, a talker _ the role filled by middle
linebacker Dusty Renfro last year. Lewis, who was an All-Greater
Houston running back as a senior at Aldine, is trying to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to step up and take that responsibility,'' Lewis
said. ``Dusty was a great leader, and it will take a lot for
somebody to give the team what he brought to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis brings speed to the middle, where he is expected to start,
depending on how Hicks fares in practice this week. Hicks, a
fifth-year senior who was named the team's Most Improved Defensive
Player last season, had reconstructive knee surgery after suffering
a season-ending injury at Texas Tech last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough players and athletes to step up when somebody
is out, and we haven't had that,'' Hicks said. ``You can see the
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   You could also see the defense's improvement after that sloppy
beginning in '98. New Mexico State rushed for 233 yards and passed
for 250 in that first game, but by season's end the Longhorns were
able to stuff eventual Big 12 champion Texas A&AMP;M's running game (25
carries for minus-seven yards) while holding the Aggies to 173
total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said this year's defense is much better going into the
season and should be better than the group that ended last season
with a win over Mississippi State in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run faster than we did at this time last year, we're
playing with more confidence, we have more depth at linebacker and
the defensive front, our safeties are tackling better than we did
this time last year, and we're playing better man coverage,'' Brown
said. ``I think everything on defense is better than it was last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its marked improvement, which helped the Longhorns to
a 9-3 season, the Texas defense was one of the worst in the country
against the pass. Texas gave up 220.9 yards a game through the air
and 15.9 yards per reception, more than its big-play offense was
able to generate (15.6). Baylor was the only Big 12 team to allow
more passing yards (2,499 to Texas' 2,430).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Longhorns finished 92nd in the country in pass
defense.
</P>
<P>
   And the Longhorns finished 83rd in the nation in scoring
defense, allowing 29.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Enter N.C. State, which finished 7-5 a year ago and comes to
town on the shoulders of Jamie Barnette, the school's all-time
leading passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let some people make big plays on us, and we had some tough
games, but it'll be different this year,'' said Walker, a junior
who started 11 games last year. ``We've worked really hard to
improve our man-to-man coverage, and it'll show.''
</P>
<P>
   It had better, because the 6-0, 196-pound Barnette has a
penchant for making big plays. The fleet-footed senior, who has
been a starter since midway through his freshman season, completed
55 passes for more than 20 yards last year and is on track to
become the Atlantic Coast Conference's all-time leading passer.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese's love for all-out
blitzes, the Longhorns could be in for a long night if they do not
get to Barnette early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we've got to do to help our secondary is get to the
quarterback,'' Brown said. ``No one can cover guys that run 4.4 or
4.5 very long. Our secondary gets beaten up every time there's a
deep ball that's thrown for a touchdown, but in some cases that's
because we're not getting pressure on the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Barnette) gets to stand back there long, we're in bad,
bad trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that Texas' defense can carry its less experienced offense
early in the season put even more pressure on Walker and Co. N.C.
State finished 10th in the country in passing yardage a year ago,
and Stanford, which comes to Austin on Sept. 4, ended the year at
No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the defense has nothing to fear from those two squads
since it takes on a potent Longhorns passing offense every day in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cornerbacks going against Kwame Cavil, one of the best
receivers in the country, and Major Applewhite, one of the better
quarterbacks in the country, helps us a lot as a team,'' he said.
``Our guys have had to fight every day. We're ready to see a
different-color uniform.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NO one cried.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, a few puddled up. I saw a younger woman, a blonde, and an
older, silver-haired one, a few rows apart, dab at their eyes with
a hankie. But four days after her death, there were not many tears
left to be shed for Kim Perrot, the cuddly little Comets guard who
captured a city's heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to cry when the house is jumping. This house happened
to be the palatial Second Baptist Church, with its stained glass
dome and an auditorium large enough for a basketball game. The
music from the choir and two soloists almost blew off the roof, and
what they staged Monday was more than what had been advertised,
much more than a celebration of life. This was a concert.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the guests were on their feet, standing and clapping,
and from different points in the room the word ``right!'' would pop
up like bubbles, in response to a nicely turned phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the sky was growly, with dark clouds that threatened
rain but never delivered. So the day was drier than you had
imagined, as Kim's family, friends, fans and teammates gathered to
comfort one another.
</P>
<P>
   They were not in a mournful mood. There was no casket, no
burial, just candid shots on the video screen and loving words from
half a dozen speakers, including Les Alexander, the owner of the
Comets; Van Chancellor, their coach; and Cynthia Cooper, the team's
star and Kim's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper read a passage from a poem that Perrot had included in a
letter written in her final days. The poem was titled Me, and
included this haunting and perfectly aimed thought:
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in the mirror and don't know what I see,
</P>
<P>
   ``I look again and see that it is me.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my head there is no hair,
</P>
<P>
   ``And an upside-down horseshoe that causes people to stare.''
</P>
<P>
   The scar was the visible reminder of the surgery that removed a
brain tumor the size of a golf ball but could not save her life.
She did not wear a wig, and only on occasion donned a cap or a hat.
There was nothing self-conscious about Kim, before or after her
illness. This was her look, her essence, herself. She had that gift
of making you feel you knew her, even if you had never gotten
closer than 20 rows from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, we did get to know her in the not-quite-three years
that she helped represent women's basketball in Houston. She didn't
have a lengthy career, nor life, but she never wasted a minute of
either. She was not a legend, or a superstar, or a national name or
face. She was uniquely Houston's own, out of neighboring Louisiana,
Our Girl.
</P>
<P>
   She had pride and energy and wit and the kind of courage that
inspires those who have it to get close to the flame because the
light is better.
</P>
<P>
   She wore No. 10 on her jersey, and she was one, a perfect 10,
certainly in heart and soul. You think of her with her curly hair
cropped short and blond, taking the ball to the hole after a steal,
pointing both index fingers at the crowd behind the basket in a
two-gun salute. And flashing a smile that said, simply, ``Can you
believe it? I get paid to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   She dealt so openly with her battle against cancer that she drew
most of the sports community, and many outside it, into her story.
They embraced her with hoops of steel.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd on the first workday of the week was around 3,000, and
as you studied them filing out of the church, a non-scientific poll
suggested these results: Half were men and half were women, half
were young and half were old, half were black and half were white.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Dawson, a former coach and now an executive with both
the Rockets and the Comets, may have given us the best of all
character insights. ``She reminded me of Calvin Murphy,'' he said.
``Calvin woke up every morning feeling that he had something to
prove. Kim was exactly the same. She never stopped competing.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 5-5 and feisty, flush with confidence, a role model for
any girl, or boy, who wants to dream. She beat the odds to become a
star in college at Southwestern Louisiana, broke records, played on
USA championship teams, and went to Europe for modest money. In the
late 1980s, women's basketball didn't really exist in America. It
was like being an astronaut, spending your life in training, and
being told there was no moon.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Perrot was 32, with potential and plans, when her time ran
out. She didn't smoke or drink or do drugs; there was no
self-destructive behavior that can be blamed for what happened to
her. It just happened. After the services, the guests mingled in
the parking lot, reluctant to leave. You only hope that she really
knew how deeply she touched this city, and these fans, because the
outpouring for Kim went well beyond the usual grief for an athlete
dying young.

RELIGIOUS COALITION PLANS GAY RIGHTS STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 3rd graf with motivation for location.) 
(ATTN: Colo.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ An unusual coalition of religious
groups representing Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews, Mormons and
Muslims is trying to forge a major public voice in support of gay
rights to counter the efforts of religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the groups _ some of them caucuses working within
denominations, others not recognized by officials in their faiths _
gathered Monday morning for the first of two days of strategy
sessions in a downtown hotel, to discuss how and when their
coalition, the National Religious Leadership Roundtable, should
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers deliberately chose to hold the meeting in a region
that is home to many conservative Christian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the battle against us is religiously based,'' said
Robert Miailovich, president of Dignity USA, an organization that
supports gay Catholics. Miailovich, one of about three dozen
participants at the meeting, added that there was ``a great deal of
religious response to the religious attacks; you don't have to be
an atheist to respond to the religious right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where polls regularly show religious faith to be
widely held, the potential for religious leaders to influence
public opinion on gay rights is great, and it is an important theme
at this meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Montgomery Rutt, national organizer of Equal Partners in
Faith, a liberal religious organization that helped found the round
table, cited the support of liberal religious leaders for the civil
rights movement in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious support for civil rights in any kind of movement
is crucial,'' Ms. Rutt said.
</P>
<P>
   In a session at the meeting that focused on same-sex marriage,
Evan Wolfson, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, said he expected the Hawaii Supreme Court to decide soon
whether homosexuals should be allowed the right to civil marriage
there.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that religious groups that support gay rights
needed to educate the public and also help ``beat back the
backlash'' of political measures at the state level that bar
same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The round table, which includes representatives from People for
the American Way and a few other secular liberal organizations, was
organized in July 1998 as a project of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force's policy institute and Equal Partners in Faith. The
policy institute's director, Urvashi Vaid, said the organization
reflected a recognition that there was ``this whole pro-gay
religious movement in every denomination, in every faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the period since its formation has not been a happy
one for those who favor a greater role for gay and lesbian
worshippers in organized religion. In August 1998, bishops
representing the communion of Anglican churches worldwide, which
includes the Episcopal Church, passed a resolution strongly
critical of homosexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March, the Rev. Greg Dell, a United Methodist minister
in Chicago, was suspended after an ecclesiastical court convicted
him of violating his denomination's rules by officiating at a
same-sex union. And in July, the Vatican ordered the Rev. Robert
Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick, a priest and a nun who had long
worked with gay and lesbian Catholics, to end their ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, participants at the meeting, which is being
held at the Antlers Adams Mark Hotel, said they were not
discouraged by those events.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stand up, you run the risk of being fired on,'' said
the Rev. Patti Ackerman, an Episcopal priest in Patterson, N.Y.,
who is also a spokeswoman for Integrity, an organization for gay
and lesbian Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., she
added, ``We have excellent role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman also mentioned the murders of two gay men, Matthew
Shepard in Wyoming last October and Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama
in February. But ``God has given us the courage of strength,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the discussion Monday morning turned on basic questions
like how far the interfaith group should go in responding to an
event in a particular denomination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, several participants said that while the round
table would have been right to voice general support for the Rev.
Jimmy Creech, a Methodist minister in Omaha, Neb., put on trial in
1998 for officiating at a same-sex union, it should steer clear of
debating internal Methodist politics and rules.
</P>
<P>
   Creech, who was narrowly acquitted in that trial but whose
bishop declined to reappoint him as a pastor, is a guest at the
meeting, one of six speakers at a public event Monday night, a
panel discussion on the theme of sexuality and spirituality.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SEVILLE, Spain _ The problem with being Marion Jones is that only
first place counts.
</P>
<P>
   So on a night when a little fellow from Morocco broke up an
expected sweep by the Kenyans in the steeplechase, wrapped himself
in his country's flag and cried joyously to celebrate a bronze
medal, Jones fought back tears of disappointment Monday over a
similar finish of her own in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bronze is just not gonna cut it for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, bronze doesn't cut it for an
American audience that pays real attention to track and field only
in Olympic years, or for the worldwide perception of a sport that
is trying to fight off the latest round of drug scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, it had been hoped, would be the poster girl for the new
millennium in the U.S. heading into the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and
also the beacon whose light would outshine all of the recent
negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   She had come here in a sort of reverse-Columbus move to discover
entirely uncharted ground, to become the first athlete ever to win
four gold medals at a single World Championships. And she had taken
the first step with a convincing win in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   That was not surprising at all, since the running part of Jones'
act has always come easy. She has not lost a 100 since September
1997 and has not been beaten in the 200 since 1995. Put those two
events into the bank, along with another expected win in either the
4x100 or 4x400 relay at the end of the week, and the long jump was
the only part of her ambitious schedule where she appeared
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Which turned out to be precisely the case. The best Jones could
do was a leap of 22 feet, 5 inches on her fifth attempt, which came
up short to both Niurka Montalvo of Spain (23-2) and Fiona May of
Italy (22-9\) and was also well off her personal best of 23-11}.
Dawn Burrell of the University of Houston finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was called for a foul on her last and best jump, having
appeared to barely get the tip of her toe on the plasticene strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mighty close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The evening then ended in a storm of controversy when the
Spanish judge allowed the final and winning jump by Montalvo to
stand, even though replays on the giant video board indicated she,
too, had fouled. The Italian federation filed an official protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get me into that,'' said Jones. ``I've got
enough problems of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   First, learning how to refine a very ugly jumping technique in
order to be a real gold-medal threat in the long jump next year in
Sydney. Also, to convince herself and the rest of the world that by
winning ``only'' three gold medals here, it would be an awesome
week.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones' mind, it is as clear-cut as when the matador enters
the ring at the Plaza de Toros de la Maestranza: There is only one
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to win every event that I entered here, and I
think everybody knows that,'' Jones said. ``I have no excuses. I
can sleep well knowing that I didn't hold anything back, but it
just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, nobody should say Jones doesn't deserve applause
for at least sticking her neck out there and trying.
</P>
<P>
   While there was so much pre-meet talk of her going for four
golds, there has also been a groundswell of behind-the-scenes
gossip about Jones. There are track fans and some competitors who
viewed the attempt as a grandstanding play for attention and some
rivals who've begun sniping.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Arron of France, the European 100 champ, accused
officials in the sport of being lax in out-of-competition drug
testing and wondered how it is possible that ``American sprinters
put together victory after victory despite so much travel.'' Arron
also labeled Jones as ``cold, distant and pretentious.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is interesting, because those were some of the same words
used to describe Carl Lewis during the prime of his incredible
career.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is a case of simple jealousy from those on the outside.
Or maybe the truly great ones carry themselves a little differently
because they are competing on a different level. Does anybody
remember another athlete with the initials M.J. being downright
haughty at times in a game?
</P>
<P>
   But as Lewis learned at the 1984 Olympics, when you go public
with a historic goal, the public then merely expects you to do it.
Anything less is seen as failure, and Lewis was even booed in LA
for passing up his last two attempts in the long jump to preserve
energy in his grueling quest.
</P>
<P>
   This is Marion Jones' time under the microscope. What she has to
understand is that between here and Sydney, it only gets worse.

KU OFFERS MINI MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR THE LAYPERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Have you thought about going to medical
school, but you can't stand the sight of blood? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The University of Kansas Medical Center has a deal for you: an
eight-session course taught by some of the center's top faculty
that will give you a working knowledge of the human body and its
ailments without ever having to make an incision or give an
injection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's called Mini Medical School, and it is a form of education
that a growing number of medical schools are offering
successfully. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they're offered, mini medical schools attract sellout
crowds of people eager for a quick immersion into the scientific
discoveries affecting their health care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry for this information,'' said Mary Beth
Gentry, assistant dean of the KU School of Medicine in Kansas City,
Kan. ``A lot of people don't understand what academic medicine is
all about. This way, we can put a human face on it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the school is to encourage support for the
medical center's research, said Jasjit Ahluwalia, a faculty member
and organizer of the Mini Medical School. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have the public behind us (to foster research)
because it's the public's money,'' Ahluwalia said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each lecture will be followed by an extended question-and-answer
period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the essence of medical school,'' Gentry
said. ``It is going to combine the science and the treatment of
disease. It won't be dumbed down.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first mini medical school was held in 1989 at the University
of Colorado as a gesture of community outreach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Cohen, a professor of immunology who organized it, said he
expected the mini medical school to have the same kind of limited
popularity a bird-watching course might attract. Perhaps 20 persons
would sign up, he thought. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a newspaper ran an article about it, 1,200 people called
to enroll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were swamped. We had to find a big hall,'' Cohen said.
Colorado has continued its mini medical school every year since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remained one of the hotter tickets in town. We've never
been able to get rid of our waiting list,'' Cohen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Colorado's success, more than 70 medical schools, health
departments and other institutions have held mini medical schools.
About 55 schools offer them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rest until every medical school is doing
one,'' said Bruce Fuchs, director of the National Institutes of
Health's Office of Science Education and an advocate for the mini
medical school movement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs started mini medical schools at the Medical College of
Virginia and more recently at the National Institutes of Health. He
is writing a how-to manual for medical schools that want to start
one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea we want to get across to people attending mini
medical schools is that you're going to learn serious information
and you're going to have more fun than you imagine,'' Fuchs said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to send people away with a sense of what's possible,
what they can learn if they put their mind to it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs said the people who enroll in mini medical schools ranged
from truck drivers to clergy to homemakers to college professors.
Some are students considering a medical career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More often they are people trying to learn how to make good
medical decisions for themselves and their families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling pressure to become more knowledgeable about
health care,'' Fuchs said. ``They're being asked by their doctors
to be more of a participant in their health care, rather than
receiving it passively.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That intense interest shows up frequently during one of the most
popular parts of mini medical schools, the question-and-answer
sessions that follow the lectures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Cohen said. ``That often goes on until the
janitor turns out the lights.'' &QL;

BRADLEY GOES TO HARLEM TO SPEAK ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to replace `sentencing of criminals' with `prison terms' in
lede. No other changes.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In some of his most detailed remarks about race
relations and the plight of urban America to date, Bill Bradley
told a Harlem audience Monday night that he would use the power of
the presidency to push for universal health care, end child
poverty, abolish mandatory prison terms and end racial profiling by
police.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour appearance before more than 500 people at the
National Action Network, a group led by the Rev. Al Sharpton,
Bradley said that the desire to improve race relations was a major
reason he first became interested in Democratic Party politics some
35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is that racial unity is not a political
position,'' he said. ``It is who I am. It's what I believe. It's
what I care most about. It's one of the main motivations for my
being in politics in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bradley, the former U.S. senator from New Jersey,
has been telling audiences that he considers race relations a
``defining issue'' in American politics today. But in appearing
before Sharpton's group, he made it clear that he is willing to
work closely with the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party, at
least on issues concerning race and urban poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appearance also provided a political boost for
Sharpton, who at times has been ostracized by some Democratic Party
officials, but whose standing within the party seems to have risen,
partly because of public outcry against police brutality in New
York City and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Though he declined to say whether he would endorse Bradley,
Sharpton praised the former senator for being, he said, the first
presidential candidate since Robert Kennedy in 1968 to campaign in
Harlem. And he called on the other candidates to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not continue an illicit affair where people have fun
with us in private but don't want to deal with us and our issues in
public,'' Sharpton said to much laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has described his campaign as being in a phase where he
outlines general positions without getting into policy details. For
that, he has been criticized as overly vague by supporters of Vice
President Al Gore, who is generally viewed as the front-runner for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, during a speech he gave from notes as well as
in answers to questions from the crowd afterward, Bradley did not
shy away from taking clear and strong positions on a number of
major issues. And more often than not, his remarks drew warm
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how he would help the urban poor, Bradley said he
would institute policies intended to end discriminatory lending
practices by banks, press for tax cuts specifically aimed at
helping middle-class and low-income people, raise the minimum wage
and push for legislation that would make it easier for workers to
join labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he would veto a $792 billion tax cut recently
approved by Congress ``in a nanosecond,'' Bradley also said he
would use the federal surplus to extend health insurance to all
Americans and to reduce childhood poverty. But he did not offer
specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know that because of what we did over four or
eight years that every child in America has a chance to realize his
or her potential,'' he said. ``There are still 14 million children
today who live in poverty. There are still 45 million people in
America without health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   As he often does in his speeches on race, Bradley, a former New
York Knick, recalled his experiences playing alongside blacks on
athletic teams. In his hometown of Crystal City, Mo., he said, the
Little League baseball team was integrated ahead of other town
institutions. And he recounted being forced to stay in ``third-rate
hotels'' and being denied service in segregated restaurants while
traveling with the Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked out of more than one restaurant in our time,'' he
said to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who received a standing ovation when he finished, also
asserted that he had made it a point to speak forcefully about race
relations on the floor of the Senate. He recounted a floor speech
he gave after the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police
officers in March 1991, when he pounded the lectern 56 times in two
minutes to dramatize the number of times the police hit King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to show that a white face could talk about race
without vaporizing before your eyes,'' Bradley said. ``I'm still
here.''

COLUMN: FORGIVENESS ELUDES PETE ROSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In worlds as diverse as professional sports and
radical politics, the subject Monday was redemption. Sounds like a
topic better suited for a theology class, but there it was, popping
up from Police Headquarters to Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At headquarters, the police brass made clear that they saw no
chance for redemption, not now anyway, for people who belonged to a
Puerto Rican nationalist group responsible for a series of
bombings, including one that killed four people at Fraunces Tavern
in 1975. President Clinton has offered conditional clemency to 16
imprisoned members of the group, the FALN. Although these people
were not themselves convicted of shedding blood, the police
commissioner, Howard Safir, suggested that the mere hint of
absolution amounted to a betrayal of terrorism's victims.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the question of redemption along Park Avenue may
seem almost trivial, but it probably intrigues far more people
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Park Avenue, among its many attributes, is home to Major League
Baseball, which can often be a world unto itself. That point is
being vividly underlined this week on the anniversary of one of its
most hotly disputed actions: the lifetime banishment of Pete Rose
for gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In case you are not familiar with baseball, Rose was one of the
all-time greats, with more hits (4,256) than anyone in the history
of the game. He was called Charlie Hustle. Day after day, he showed
what a gung-ho attitude can do _a lesson seemingly lost on proud
underachievers of the Bart Simpson generation.
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, Rose was also one of the all-time great
jerks, squandering his considerable reputation on an insatiable
desire to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Tuesday, Major League Baseball banned him for life
and declared him ineligible for its Hall of Fame in Cooperstown,
N.Y. That was because its investigators said his gambling included
wagers on baseball games, even some played by the team he was then
managing, the Cincinnati Reds. Although Rose denied having placed
such bets, the baseball commissioner then, A. Bartlett Giamatti,
did not believe him and hurled him into the sport's equivalent of
the netherworld.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are a decade later, and in the morality play that
professional athletics has so often become, the question for the
powers on Park Avenue is whether Pete Rose has suffered enough. Is
there no chance for his redemption in a sports world that has given
second and even third chances to players who abused drugs, raped
women, choked their coaches, drank themselves into stupors and beat
girlfriends to a pulp?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. The present commissioner, Bud Selig, sees no
reason to reverse the much-respected Giamatti, who died a few days
after banning Rose. ``Basically what he's said is that he doesn't
see anything new to warrant any changes,'' Richard Levin, a
spokesman for Selig, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many would agree. Their argument is that if Rose did indeed bet
on his own team, even to win and even with no public evidence that
he ever tried to alter the result of a game, he struck at the heart
of baseball's integrity. This is a sport that has yet to recover
fully from the terrible scandal of 1919, when members of the
Chicago White Sox ``threw'' World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   But some see a moralizing on Park Avenue that they regard as
smug at best and hypocritical at worst.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, how some baseball officials are citing Rose's
fondness for casinos and race tracks as proof that he remains
hopelessly unrehabilitated. Yet the sport lets George Steinbrenner
run the New York Yankees, though he also owns race horses. Do those
horses exist for any purpose other than gambling? And if wagering
is by definition unsavory, how is it that virtually every state
makes millions through lotteries, and many allow Indian-run casinos
to thrive?
</P>
<P>
   ``The judgment on ballplayers should be confined to their skills
on the field,'' said Eliot Asinof, who detailed the 1919 Chicago
scandal in his 1963 book ``Eight Men Out'' (Holt, Rinehart &AMP;
Winston). ``Rose was never complicit in throwing a game. He never
did anything that even suggests he was capable of such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is enough,'' Asinof said, a thought that Rose echoed
Monday in an interview on NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans of America are willing to forgive me,'' he said. ``It
seems like everybody's willing to forgive me except Bud Selig.''

POLICE COMMISSIONER DEFENDS THROWN-OUT ARRESTS  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir on Monday defended
the validity of thousands of arrests made by police officers,
saying the arrests, which city prosecutors deemed flawed and threw
out, should have been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, who called for police officials and prosecutors to meet
and review the problem of unprosecuted arrests, singled out the
office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, for
failing to prosecute valid gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gun case that's not prosecuted in Brooklyn is prosecuted in
all four of the other boroughs,'' Safir said. ``We're the only city
in the United States that is in five counties, where you have five
separately elected district attorneys who all have different
policies and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hawkins, chief of investigation for Hynes, challenged the
police commissioner's statement, saying Hynes is tough on gun
crimes and has a policy of offering no plea bargains in gun cases.
The district attorney announced the policy, an attempt to curb a
rise in gun-related homicides, in a news conference with Safir in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Safir's remarks were in response to an article Monday in The New
York Times that found a sharp rise in the number of arrests
prosecutors deemed to be flawed. Last year, prosecutors tossed out
18,000 of the 345,000 arrests made in the city even before a judge
reviewed the charges, more than double the number of four years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The figure means that citywide, 50 people a day are arrested,
fingerprinted and jailed, then released after prosecutors have
rejected the charges against them, often after those arrested have
spent hours or overnight in packed holding cells. Former
prosecutors and courthouse lawyers said the rise might signify a
decline in the validity of arrests in the city as officers struggle
to keep arrest totals high in an era of declining crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir said Monday that the validity of arrests had not
declined, and he blamed prosecutors for the problem, pointing out
that the rate of nonprosecutions varied among the boroughs. The
rate of cases rejected by prosecutors doubled in Brooklyn and was
up 41 percent in the Bronx and 23 percent in Manhattan, but was
down in Queens. Prosecutors on Staten Island said that records from
previous years had been damaged in a fire, making comparisons
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's largely due to the interpretation of individual
assistant district attorneys,'' Safir said. ``My police officers
and my legal bureau very often disagree with whether or not a case
is prosecutable.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors throw out arrests for a variety of reasons,
including improper searches and inconclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But other elected officials called the increase in unprosecuted
arrests troubling and said it might represent a major problem in
the department. They called for the state attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer, to expand his investigation of the Police Department's
policy of stopping people on the streets and searching them for
weapons, known as stop and frisk, to see whether officers
frequently made flawed arrests in minority areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Leffler, chairman of the City Council's Public Safety
Committee, which oversees the Police Department, said the number of
flawed arrests is too high and that they waste taxpayers' money. He
said his committee might investigate the rise if Spitzer and
federal authorities do not.

BAYLOR COACH PICKS ALFRED TO START AT QUARTERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 12-NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH AND MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baylor coach Kevin Steele selected Jermaine Alfred as his
starting quarterback Monday, ending a competition with Odell James
that dated to last season, when both players split time at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, a senior, will start in the team's Sept. 4 season opener
at Boston College and will begin taking the brunt of the snaps in
daily practices. James, a junior who began the 1998 season as the
team's starter, might earn playing time in selected situations,
Steele said. But Steele stressed that, with a team playing for its
third head coach since 1996, stability at quarterback is crucial to
the Bears' rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in a one-quarterback system, and particularly in
this environment right now,'' Steele said. ``There's been a lot of
fluctuation in a lot of areas around here and we need to build some
stability. Quarterback is a good place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not rule out the possibility of James, the better
runner of the two, being used in selected situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see them both in the game. They both have
strengths,'' Steele said. ``But I don't believe in pulling somebody
just to prove a point. The way we play them will be scheduled and
game-planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred led the team in passing last season, completing 97 of 188
attempts (51.6 percent) for 1,268 yards. James connected on 52.9
percent of his passes (45-of-85) for 435 yards. Both players threw
seven interceptions in 1998, with Alfred tossing two touchdown
passes to one for James. A&AMP;M'S jOHNSON HAS PIN SET IN FOOT
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M sophomore wide receiver Bethel Johnson is questionable
for the Aggies' Sept. 4 opener against Louisiana Tech in
Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   The speedster from Corsicana, who is counted on to be an impact
receiver after sitting out last season as a partial academic
qualifier, had a pin set into the fifth metatarsal of his right
foot Monday. Johnson apparently injured the foot last week and
X-rays taken after Saturday's scrimmage discovered a stress
fracture. The guess is that with an open date after the Louisiana
Tech game, Johnson should return for Tulsa on Sept. 18. nn

TCU PROMOTES FRESHMAN QB TO SECOND STRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU coach Dennis Franchione held out as long
as he could, but the play of freshman quarterback Casey Printers
forced him to put the eraser to the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione said Monday that Printers has jumped into the No. 2
quarterback spot behind starter Patrick Batteaux. If Batteaux were
injured in the season opener against No. 4 Arizona, Printers would
play despite never having taken a collegiate snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the second-best quarterback now,'' Franchione said. ``If
he keeps going at the pace he's going, he'll be the starter. But
there is still separation between No. 1 and 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into two-a-days, Matt Schobel was listed as No. 2. He
asked to be moved to wide receiver last week, leaving Printers,
Sean Stilley and Jeff Dover battling for the backup role. Printers
separated himself from the others with his passing and big-play
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt myself moving along,'' Printers said. ``This is exactly
where I wanted to be, but at the same time I still have a lot to
accomplish. I'm still not satisfied with the way I'm performing.''
CAST WORKS FOR MAIDEN
</P>
<P>
   TCU trainers tried a new cast on linebacker Terrance Maiden's
right arm Monday, allowing him to participate in full-contact
drills for the first time in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is designed to prevent movement in Maiden's wrist, hand
and fingers while allowing him to tackle and drop back into
coverage. Maiden hadn't been involved in full contact since he
suffered a hairline fracture in his arm 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncomfortable,'' Maiden said of the cast that completely
covers his hand. ``But I think I will be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Franchione said this week that the new cast will
determine whether or not Maiden will be ready by the Arizona game.
Maiden was expected to be other starter alongside Shannon Brazzell
at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   And if Maiden's arm isn't ready, who would play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Franchione said. ``Nobody has been
consistent there.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices include Chad Bayer, John Turntine, Adrian Lewis and
his brother, Allen. GLAD HE'S BACK
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was happier to see Frogs backup quarterback/holder Jeff
Dover return for his senior season than kicker Chris Kaylakie.
</P>
<P>
   Dover missed spring practice, playing baseball for TCU, and
Kaylakie missed him.
</P>
<P>
   The walk-on, who made 15 of 20 field goals during the season,
found himself struggling to hit an extra point in the spring. He
said the difference was all in the hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gotten so used to Jeff,'' Kaylakie said. ``I really
struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Dover is back and so is the Kaylakie, who was a semifinalist
for the 1998 Lou Groza award, given annually to the nation's best
kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's gotten his holder situation more stable,'' Dennis
Franchione said. ``There is a bond of trust, and Chris feels more
comfortable.'' LINE MOVE

SAMAKI WALKER WORKS OUT FOR SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samaki Walker's next NBA stop might be a short trip from Dallas
down Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the free-agent forward flew to San Antonio to work out
for the Spurs, who are fresh off winning the recent NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hopes to get the three-year, $8.9 million contract the
Spurs offered Los Angeles Clippers free agent Tyrone Nesby this
month. The Clippers matched that offer to Nesby, leaving the Spurs
searching for another front-line player.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs also have a $2.75 million medical exception _ from the
Sean Elliott case _ that they can offer Walker. Elliott had a
kidney transplant last week, and his basketball future remains
uncertain. In addition, San Antonio has its $1.1 million exception
available.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Spurs are set to sign backup center/forward Will
Purdue this week, it's not certain where Walker will fit in on this
squad. Purdue, also a free agent, turned down a four-year, $12
million contract extension from the Spurs during this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's agent, Norm Nixon, said he also has talked to
Vancouver, Washington, Minnesota, Orlando, Houston, Utah and Miami
about signing Walker. All of those teams have offered Walker their
$2 million exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get the ($2 million) exception all over the place,
but we really haven't pursued the exception,'' Nixon said. ``I
talked to (Washington coach) Gar Heard on Friday and he told me
they had the exception on the table to offer Samaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando is still interested in doing something with Samaki,
and I know Milwaukee is interested in him. But we're going to meet
and try to bring this stuff to a head within the next week or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is hoping Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson would
agree to a sign-and-trade package involving Walker. Nelson is
expected to return from China on Wednesday and could not be reached
for comment. TRENT TO SIGN
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent forward Gary Trent will sign a contract with the
Mavericks within a week, a source close to the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Trent can
either sign a one-year, $2 million deal or a two-year, $4.2 million
contract with the Mavericks. CEBALLOS WAITS
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos' agent said he is very intrigued about what will
happen to his client once Don Nelson returns from China.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos has a two-year, $8 million offer on the table from
Nelson. But the free-agent forward wants a four-year, $16 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie told me not to do anything until he gets back,'' said
Fred Slaughter, the agent who represents Ceballos. ``And I can't
get Ced's deal done without that team's representative being across
the table, or without that team's representative talking to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once Nellie returns from the mainland, we're going to try
and see if we can go ahead and get the deal done.'' PRESEASON GAMES
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will play three preseason games at Reunion Arena
this year.
</P>
<P>
   They include Oct. 16 against Charlotte, Oct. 21 against Toronto
and Oct. 26 against the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' road preseason schedule will be released later
this month. nn

TEXAS LONGHORNS SUDDENLY DEEP AT LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ By signing linebacker Cory Redding, Texas
defensive coordinator Carl Reese thought he had found the remedy
for a recurring itch.
</P>
<P>
   Reese envisioned Redding, the 1998 ``USA Today'' defensive
player of the year, as an impact freshman who could prevent him
from spending a second consecutive season ``scratching all over the
place'' in search of three linebackers he felt comfortable putting
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of fall drills, Reese said Redding has been
``something special,'' a must-play freshman of the highest order.
Yet when Redding takes the field for his first snap in Saturday's
season opener against North Carolina State (7:30 p.m., Austin),
Reese plans to play him at defensive end. In fact, Reese said
Redding might never play linebacker at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a testament to the guys we've got,'' said Reese, who has
been stunned by the progress of five linebackers (three sophomores,
two redshirt freshmen) who played few or zero snaps at the position
in 1998. ``Cory Redding is something special. He could have played
linebacker for us. But he would have had to split time with these
guys. We need him on the field. So, he's needed elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese never envisioned making that statement in February. But
that was before he saw returnees Anthony Hicks and De'Andre Lewis
adjust to life at middle linebacker. That was before outside
linebacker Aaron Babino regained his academic eligibility after
sitting out spring drills. That was before Reese saw the speed and
versatility of fresh faces Tyrone Jones, Marcus Wilkins, Everick
Rawls, Jamal Joyner and Adam McConathy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a position that has been a perennial problem spot for
the Longhorns throughout the 1990s is awash in young, fast, talent.
Hicks, who is coming off reconstructive knee surgery, is reminded
of the change every day during wind sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we run as a group, I'm used to being at the front of the
lines and leading the pack,'' said Hicks, who has been cleared to
begin contact drills this week in preparation for Saturday's
opener. ``But these guys make me look slow.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not because of the knee, said Hicks, who graded out at
92 percent on strength and agility tests last week as part of his
rehabilitation process. It's because guys such as Jones (6-foot-4,
230 pounds) and Joyner (6-2, 205), two converted defensive backs,
have filled out since last season without slowing down. It's
because Wilkins and Rawls, two sophomores who combined for 20
tackles last season, can break 4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash and
are close to breaking into the starting lineup as well.
</P>
<P>
   That would be just fine with Texas coach Mack Brown, who lost
the leading tackler from last season's linebacker corps (Dusty
Renfro) to the NFL and has kept his two most experienced returnees,
Hicks and Lewis, out of contact drills for much of two-a-days
because of knee and ankle ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after the team's final scrimmage, Brown said he would
be comfortable with an all-sophomore starting lineup of Jones
(strong side), Wilkins (middle) and Rawls (weak side) against North
Carolina State. None of the three have started in a college game.
But all three worked with the No. 1 defense Monday, pending the
availabilities of Hicks and Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told our (veterans), `You can lose your position because
of an injury,''' Brown said. ``I'm not concerned about the young
guys we have out there. They're playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in particular, has turned heads with his speed, long arms
and jumping ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to bring Texas linebackers back to where they used
to be,'' Jones said. ``We're going to be faster, more athletic and
more explosive than the guys that have played here the past few
years. I think we'll surprise a lot of people, even our coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Reese among the pleasantly perplexed. For the North
Carolina State game, he plans to use a seven-linebacker rotation
for three positions. And none of the seven is named Redding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been anywhere before where I had that many
linebackers I could play and feel good about,'' said Reese, whose
prior stops include LSU, Virginia and Missouri, among others. ``No
question, it's a lot different from last year, when we were
scratching all over the place just to find three linebackers to put
out there.'' nn

WARREN'S TARDINESS UPSETTING TO COWBOYS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys waited until the
next-to-last full day of training camp to have a little controversy
over what could be a big injury, if it lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren, a four-time 1,000-yard rusher in his second season
as Emmitt Smith's backup with the Cowboys, flew to Colorado
Springs, Colo., last week to see a specialist for a recurring groin
injury. The Cowboys were informed by Warren's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris made the decision on his own. We were made aware of it
through his agent,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Monday night.
``Chris is going to be a very important part of what we do this
year, so we'll sit down and visit, and get a real good picture of
where he is with this injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones wouldn't speculate on a possible fine until he and coach
Chan Gailey have a chance to meet with Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey admittedly was caught by surprise last week when he
learned that Warren had left camp to visit Dr. Michael Leahy in
Colorado Springs. He seemed perturbed Monday by Warren's failure to
report back to the team in time for the team's first practice
following Saturday night's 34-14 loss to New England.
</P>
<P>
   To Gailey, Warren should have been in camp and attending a 4-6
p.m. practice. Warren is expected to be on the field for both
practices Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schaeffer, Warren's agent, said that his client is
``apologetic,'' and accepts all blame for the ``misunderstanding
over when he was supposed to be back.'' Warren will formally issue
an apology to Gailey and the rest of the team, Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris had some problem getting back ... a logistical thing ...
details of what happened are nobody's business,'' Schaeffer said.
``It was his error, his oversight, but it was nothing more than
that. There was no hidden agenda. And he takes full responsibility
for what happened,'' Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren apparently has benefited from this latest treatment.
Leahy uses his hands to break up scar tissue in the damaged area,
Schaeffer said, and during the off-season, the specialist was able
to increase Warren's ``range of motion by eight inches in one
30-minute session.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris recognizes the great opportunity that has been given to
him by the Cowboys. He just wants to get himself well, so that the
injury isn't exacerbated,'' Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren wasn't the only Cowboys running back not practicing
Monday. Smith sat out with blurred vision as the result of a slight
concussion suffered Saturday night. He had his pupils dilated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys offered to meet Warren at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport
Monday night and give him a ride to camp. Warren preferred instead
to make the two-hour drive in his pickup truck so that he will have
it here when the team breaks camp tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was eager to talk to Warren upon his return to the
players' dorm Monday night, obviously as much as to learn about how
Warren's groin injury has responded to treatment, as about the
details of Warren's weeklong odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me because I had asked him a couple of times how
he was doing and there didn't seem to be any ill effects,'' Gailey
said, when asked Wednesday about Warren's trip to Colorado. ``So, I
am anxious to talk to him to see what brought this on.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar groin injury forced the former Seattle Seahawk to miss
eight games last season, including the Jan. 2 playoff loss to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cowboys' first two preseason games, Warren had seven
carries for 23 yards. He also caught three passes for 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had hoped to occasionally utilize Warren and Smith in the
same backfield this season. When asked if that experiment has been
delayed by Warren's week away from camp, Gailey replied, ``We'll
just have to wait and see how that all works out.'' nn

COWBOYS MOVE SPELLMAN FROM END TO TACKLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Roughly four weeks ago, the signing of
former Chicago Bears defensive end Alonzo Spellman was a
questionable gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, it became the Dallas Cowboys' latest attempt at solving
their problems at defensive tackle in the aftermath of Leon Lett's
indefinite suspension for violating the league's substance abuse
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman, who sat out last season after being cut by the Bears
because of a string of bizarre emotional incidents, welcomes the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see how it goes,'' said Spellman, a career defensive end,
who has only previously played tackle as a nickel pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to get used to the speed of things inside,''
Spellman said. ``But I'll get used to it. The No. 1 thing is
whatever is going to make us a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also the way the Cowboys are looking at it. Second-year
tackle Michael Myers, who had been tabbed as Lett's primary
replacement, has been a disappointment in training camp. Spellman
worked out with the first team Monday in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the Cowboys were afforded the
luxury of moving Spellman because of the progress of rookie
defensive ends Ebenezer Ekuban and Peppi Zellner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early struggles from the layoff and being out of
football shape, Spellman, a seven-year veteran, has impressed the
Cowboys with his development. Gailey said Spellman has the
potential to be a standout at tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see how learns the position and adapts to the change,''
Gailey said. ``But obviously we wouldn't move him there if we
didn't think he could be a really good defensive tackle. We'll see
if he can do better than the other guys that are in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 294-pound Spellman has more experience than Myers
and the other tackle candidates Darren Benson and Nate Davis. But
he also has the strength to do the job as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I offer is the ability to take on a double team and not
get moved out of there,'' said Spellman, who has played tackle as a
member of the Cowboys third-down pass rush unit the past three
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the off-the-field stuff, Gailey said Spellman, who
suffers from bipolar disorder, said has been everything the Cowboys
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been very positive with him at this point,''
Gailey said. ``Every aspect has been positive.''

TOMS RIVER WINS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ The only question surrounding Toms River as
it began its quest for a second straight Little League World Series
title was whether the team had enough quality pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that question answered. Zack Del Vento, the New Jersey
team's No. 3 starter, allowed just four hits over 5 1/3 innings and
struck out nine Monday night to pitch Toms River to a 4-0 victory
over Boise, Idaho (0-1), before 16,500 fans at Howard J. Lamade
Stadium. Toms River, improving to 2-0 in the tournament, virtually
assured itself of a spot in the U S. championship game on Thursday,
with the winner playing for the Little League title on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River defeated Phenix City, Ala., 6-0 on Sunday night and
meets Brownsburg, Ind., on Tuesday afternoon. ``Being 2-0, it looks
pretty good,'' Mike Gaynor, the Toms River manager, said.
``Everyone else has at least one loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor did not make his decision to match Del Vento against
Boise's No. 1 pitcher until hours before Monday's game. Gaynor's
strategy saved Eric Campesi, No. 2 in the rotation, for Tuesday's
game against Indiana, although Campesi came into a two-on, one-out
jam and induced a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that was my best game,'' said Del Vento, who started
only once in the regional tournament but went 2-0. ``I was able to
hit the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Vento's fastball didn't have the velocity, nor did his curve
have the bend that Casey Gaynor's pitches did on Sunday, but Del
Vento was more than adequate.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight teams in the Little League World Series
tournament, four U.S. teams and four international teams. Each team
plays a minimum of three games. The two teams with the best records
from each pool then play one another other for their respective
championship on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Del Vento struck out three of the four
batters he faced, allowing only a bloop single to Seth Anderson. In
the second and third innings, he was just as dominant, retiring six
straight batters, striking out three of them. And he just kept
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   The Boise pitcher, Devon Biddinger, also had outstanding stuff
Monday night. He allowed only two singles through the first three
innings with three strikeouts and no walks. He proceeded to retire
the side in order in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Biddinger unraveled in the fifth inning, but Toms River failed
to exploit the situation and scored only once, Chris Fontenelli,
the shortstop, coming home on a wild pitch with the bases loaded.
Toms River loaded the bases again with one out, but did no further
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the sixth inning Toms River finally had the breakout
that everyone had been waiting for, scoring three runs on four
hits. The key hit was Casey Gaynor's two-run single coming after
Campesi drove in a run with a single.
</P>
<P>
   While most teams have only relatives and close friends cheering
for them, Toms River has an entire town rooting for the team here.
Or at least it has seemed so through their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Toms River's fans were clad in their trademark
``Beast of the East'' T-shirts and occupied an entire section in
the stands. Their boisterous chants, ``Beast is back!'' and ``Let's
go East!'' intimidated the Phenix City players, the Alabama coach
said after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people up there in the stands don't have any kids
on the team,'' said Debbie Fontenelli, the mother of Chris. ``It's
pride. We're so proud of them and we're proud of where we come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chris was not on the squad, but his mother came to
Williamsport anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent us,'' she said. ``That's us out there in those
12-year-old kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Kyle Tidwell's grand slam in the top of the
sixth capped a Phenix City comeback from a four-run deficit and
gave it a 5-4 victory over Brownsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The home run to center came on a 1-0 count with one out and just
cleared the glove of the leaping 5-foot-8-inch outfielder Sean
Veza. Tidwell said he hit a fastball from Lance Lynn that came
across the middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the international bracket Monday, Puerto Rico beat Victoria,
British Columbia, 6-4, and Osaka, Japan, beat Ramstein Air Force
Base, Germany, 5-2.

COWBOYS' ISMAIL EXPECTED TO PLAY AGAINST BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. AND RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Receiver Raghib Ismail, offensive guard
Tony Hutson and cornerback Charlie Williams are expected to make
their preseason debuts for the Cowboys this week after being
sidelined for the first three games with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail (sprained shoulder) and Williams (fractured wrist) should
be in the starting lineup for Sunday's matchup against the Denver
Broncos. Hutson (sprained knee) should help the backup offensive
line, which has been maligned for a poor preseason performance.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is expected to fill the void at right cornerback in
place of Deion Sanders (toe) and Kevin Smith (back), who are out
with injuries. Rookie free agent Duane Hawthorne has started at the
position opposite left cornerback Kevin Mathis the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said he was unclear on the prospects of guard
Everett McIver (knee) and running back Beau Morgan (toe) for the
Broncos game. Both are expected to practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are awaiting word on the status of cornerback Kevin
Smith, who remains in Dallas getting therapy on a ruptured disk in
his back.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Jim Maurer said Smith had an appointment Monday with Dr.
Andrew Dossett and that he would get a progress report Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It all has Gailey unsure of when Smith will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reacted positively to the treatment'' last week, Gailey
said. ``But where that puts him I don't know. We'll find out more
when we talk to the doctor.'' GAILEY EVALUATES
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur, linebacker Nate Hemsley and defensive
tackle Darren Benson saw their first action of the preseason
Saturday in the 34-14 loss to the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey offered observations of each.
</P>
<P>
   About LaFleur, the team's staring tight end who has been out
since minicamp after with having back and ankle surgeries, Gailey
said, ``He did some good things. It was obvious he was rusty. But
he benefited from having played in the game. I am looking forward
to him practicing this week and continuing in installing him back
into the offensive process.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur had two catches for 10 yards in the game, including a
6-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley, who is fighting for a roster spot at outside
linebacker, has been out since fracturing his ankle during training
camp last year. He had four tackles in the game.
</P>
<P>
   `He played pretty good,'' Gailey said. ``He got kicked in the
other ankle, but it was not bad. He did OK on special teams. It
will be good to continue watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   That Benson missed the first three games was a huge
disappointment to Cowboys, because they were considering him as
candidate to make up for the loss of the suspended Leon Lett.
Benson, who missed the 1998 season with a knee injury, has been
slowed for much of camp by knee swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Benson had a fragmented performance against the
Patriots, despite
</P>
<P>
   recording five tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was off and on as well,'' Gailey said. ``He did some good
things at the point of attack. But at times he was a little high.
He has to work back into things.'' HE'S ALL-PRO ... WHEN HE PLAYS
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Quentin Coryatt has yet to appear in a Cowboys
preseason game since being acquired from Indianapolis through free
agency. And he's not expected to play this week against Denver,
either.
</P>
<P>
   While Coryatt continues to nurse a strained hamstring and
Achilles', second-year strong-side linebacker Darren Hambrick is
impressing Chan Gailey and his coaching staff at a position that
has Coryatt's name all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick ``has made the most of his opportunity,'' Gailey said.
``He still has a lot to learn, but he's playing hard and playing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of their careers, Coryatt and Hambrick are no
comparison. As Gailey put it, ``When Quentin Coryatt is healthy and
playing ... I don't know if he's made All-Pro or not, but when I've
coached against him, he's been All-Pro. Hambrick might get there
one day, but it's not fair to compare the two right now.''

GLAUS IS SURPRISE HOME RUN LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Question: Who leads the Anaheim Angels in home
runs this season?
</P>
<P>
   Hint: It's not Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon or Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the season, if anyone would have guessed Troy Glaus,
they would be right. They also would have had to know the Angels
would have serious problems in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have affected the Angels' three main home run hitters,
leaving Glaus ahead with 22. Vaughn is second on the team with 21
and Garret Anderson third with 17.
</P>
<P>
   This season is Glaus' first full year in the majors, but he
played in too many games in 1998 to be eligible for Rookie of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   If Glaus continues at his current pace, he'll finish with 29
homers. But he says it wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never satisfied,'' said Glaus, 22. ``The day I'm
satisfied is the day I drive in every baserunner that's out there.
That's not realistic, I know. I'd be satisfied right now if we were
in first place and going to the playoffs, because if we're in first
place and going to the playoffs, I'm doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost doesn't count: Ramon Ortiz will not face his idol, Pedro
Martinez of the Boston Red Sox. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz and Martinez, who were teammates on a winter-league team
in their native Domincan Republic, will pitch tonight _ Ortiz
against the Blue Jays and Martinez against the Twins. On a normal
five-day rotation, that means a head-to-head matchup Sunday in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Thursday's off-day, Angels manager Terry Collins
decided to push everyone back a day, meaning Ortiz will start
Monday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On the injury front: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina made about 10-12
throws to first base during batting practice Monday, but his sore
right shoulder prevents him from throwing with any zip.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina will probably need a couple of more days before
returning to the lineup. He was hit by a pitch on the right side of
his back and also was hit on the right shoulder by a pickoff throw
while diving back to first.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that an off-balanced throw after fielding a grounder and
the combination forced him to change his throwing mechanics to
compensate.

ACTOR, OTHERS DECRY ANIMAL CRUELTY VIDEOS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY -- Actor Mickey Rooney joined animal-rights
activists and public officials Monday in touting federal
legislation that would outlaw ``crush'' videos, which depict small
animals being killed by scantily clad women.
</P>
<P>
   A bill by Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Oxnard, would provide a
five-year prison sentence for the distributors of crush videos,
which depict a little-known fetish that involves killing an animal
on-screen for the sexual gratification of the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to hand down to our children?'' asked
Rooney, who is active in animal-rights causes. ``Are we going to
hand down crush videos? It's despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for Ventura County District Attorney Michael D.
Bradbury said there are thousands of the videotapes, selling for
$60 to $100 each, in circulation around the world on hundreds of
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the East Ventura County courthouse,
officials played several clips from the videos, showing insects,
kittens, guinea pigs and mice being crushed by women in bare feet
or stiletto heels. The tapes' audio tracks enhanced the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they want to expose the million-dollar industry
because viewers who find the videotapes thrilling might feel a
desire to harm larger animals or even humans for a bigger thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the torturing of animals that we find most offensive,''
said Beverlee McGrath, an Oxnard-based representative of the Doris
Day Animal League. ``We wear animals. We eat animals. We experiment
on them. Do we have to torture and kill them for entertainment?''
</P>
<P>
   The New York chapter of the U.S. Humane Society and the Animal
Defense League in Oregon turned videotapes over to Bradbury's
investigators in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the groups said they bought the tapes over the
Internet from a company called Steponit, which rented a mail drop
box in Burbank and was traced to a man in Thousand Oaks, 40 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, whom officials refused to identify.
</P>
<P>
   District attorney's and sheriff's investigators from Ventura
County tracked down three Southern California producers of crush
videos: Steponit, Squish Productions and Getsmart. Deputy District
Attorney Tom Connors said it is difficult to make arrests since
authorities must prove that the images were filmed within three
years because of the current statute of limitations on prosecuting
cruelty to animals.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Los Angeles County authorities arrested Gary Thomason of
Long Beach, owner of Getsmart, on suspicion of cruelty to animals.
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday in West Covina for
Thomason and a co-defendant, Diane Aileen Chaffin, on three felony
counts of torturing, maiming and killing mice, including newborn
mice, and rats.
</P>
<P>
   They are accused of making a video in which the woman stomped
rodents to death with high-heeled shoes. Chaffin is jailed in lieu
of $45,000 bail. Thomason is free.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said investigators are compiling a case against Steponit
in the hope of opening up a grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegly said his bill is aimed at the distributors to attack
the industry at the money source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly drafted it to make sure that it doesn't get
involved in violating First Amendment rights for freedom of
speech,'' he said. ``We don't want these perpetrators to use (the
Constitution) as a right to perpetuate this action.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as there is no constitutional right to tape and sell child
pornography, there is no right to tape and sell videos of cruelty
to animals, he said.

ACTOR, OTHERS DECRY ANIMAL CRUELTY VIDEOS

   SIMI VALLEY -- Actor Mickey Rooney joined animal-rights
activists and public officials Monday in touting federal
legislation that would outlaw ``crush'' videos, which depict small
animals being killed by scantily clad women.
</P>
<P>
   A bill by Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Oxnard, would provide a
five-year prison sentence for the distributors of crush videos,
which depict a little-known fetish that involves killing an animal
on-screen for the sexual gratification of the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to hand down to our children?'' asked
Rooney, who is active in animal-rights causes. ``Are we going to
hand down crush videos? It's despicable.''

HOLIDAY ITEMS ALREADY ON SHELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Forget what the calendar says: It's beginning to
look a lot like Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   True, people complain that Christmas _ or, more accurately, the
commercialization of Christmas _ arrives earlier each year. But
really, this year it has come earlier than it ever has before,
hasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in August!
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, determined not to let the last big buying season of
the millennium go by without a fight, are dusting off their plastic
reindeer and spreading their artificial snow four months ahead of
the holiday. The stores are not yet overwhelmed with Yuletide
knick-knacks _ that won't happen for another week or three _ but
there's no doubt that Santa Claus has crept into Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley as well as other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem strange to be selling collectible Christmas items
when it's 100 degrees outside, but that's how business is lately,''
Ramon Orozco, a salesman at the Green Thumb Garden Center in the
Canoga Park community of the San Ferando Valley, said Monday.
``That's how business is lately _ sell things as early as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At Amy's Hallmark in the Valley's Woodland Hills community,
several hundred keepsake holiday ornaments have been on shelves
since mid-July as part of a chainwide promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But before fingers start pointing at Amy's, know that the
post-Independence Day sale has occurred at the same time for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers are always a little surprised that we're selling
that early, but they really do sell,'' said Amy's manager Paige
Thigpen. ``The early birds want to buy because they want to avoid
the crowds later and they want to get the best selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen, who will convert about half her store to Christmas
goods right after Labor Day, said the ornaments have sold well so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Barnett, owner of Cherish'd gift shop in Woodland Hills,
has seen strong sales of Mary Engelbreit Christmas ornaments and a
few other Christmas and Hanukkah items since June. She will start
installing major displays in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem early to be putting on displays, but people have
already been asking about Christmas items. I could see having a
permanent section of the store as early as July.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett predicts that home decor items will be particularly
strong.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just high-end collectibles that have reappeared. At Pic
'N' Save in Canoga Park, the discounter has started selling a
variety of Christmas goods including $4.99 artificial trees,
79-cent wreaths, 99-cent glitter shakers, 99-cent ornaments, $2.99
boxes of cards and $9.99 ceramic trees.
</P>
<P>
   A few stores go the full-year route.
</P>
<P>
   REI Crafts in Canoga Park has Christmas trees up in the front
windows and holiday decorations in its supply bins. ``We're a
crafts store, so people expect us to have this for them,'' said
REI's Elizabeth Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   At Deforest's Patio and Fireside Center in Woodland Hills,
20percent of floor space has been devoted to Radko ornaments and
Dept. 56 miniature lighted villages for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we'd be selling Christmas items in the summer,
but we think our customers appreciate it,'' said Deforest's
co-owner Pam Gietzen.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is hopping on the Christmas-in-August
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still awfully early,'' said Rick Mendoza, a manager at
the Warner Bros. Studio store in Canoga Park. ``People are always a
little suprised when they see Christmas stuff early, but they get
into it pretty easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable among those sticking to the tradition that Christmas
shopping doesn't start until after Thanksgiving is Nordstrom, which
will place no Christmas decorations in stores until Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic thinking is that customers are going to want to
enjoy the holidays as they come rather than being inundated by
Christmas,'' said spokeswoman Leslie Harris. She did admit that the
chain's Christmas catalog will be in customers' hands in
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers generally expect the combination of a strong economy
and the novelty of the 2000 celebrations to lead to good holiday
sales.
</P>
<P>
   At the Papyrus gift shop in Canoga Park, for example, one clerk
was happy that 2000 calendars _ including dogs, cats, Ricky Martin,
Leonardo DiCaprio and Elvis Presley _ have arrived because of
customer requests.
</P>
<P>
   The store also has prominently displayed Millennium Party
invitations in its front window. ``We'll have to wait and see on
those,'' the clerk said.

FARMER MIGHT MISS SEASON OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When All-American receiver Danny Farmer left
Saturday's scrimmage in a wheelchair, his injured ankle wrapped
like a mummy's limb, the Bruins termed it a mild sprain and listed
Farmer as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   They should have said game-to-game.
</P>
<P>
   Further examination revealed Farmer has a badly sprained left
ankle and might not play in UCLA's season opener Sept. 4 against
Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be a couple weeks,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
``He'll be back, but when we're not sure. I'm being very optimistic
in saying two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer injured the ankle on the sixth play of the scrimmage when
DeShaun Foster accidentally blocked Jason Stephens into Farmer's
leg, and his ankle rolled. He jogged off the field, but the pain
increased after icing. At that point, he requested a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The examination showed a high sprain _ above the ankle bone _
and those take longer to heal than sprains on/below the bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident I'll play, but I'm always a positive
person,'' Farmer said. ``I think it'll heal fast, but I'm not the
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   With Freddie Mitchell, Brian Poli-Dixon and Brad Melsby, the
Bruins are deep enough at receiver to absorb Farmer's injury for a
game or two. But they are not deep in the secondary, which makes
safety Jason Stephens' sprained right knee potentially more
troublesome than Farmer's ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to put it that way, but (the secondary) is a weakness
as opposed to a strength,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens is questionable for Boise State. If he can't play, the
two options at strong safety are sophomore Julius Williams, a
converted cornerback, and junior John Hall, a hurdler who recently
joined the football team.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup changes: After shuffling the lineup in response to the
disabled parking suspensions, Toledo released his first depth chart
Monday. Of the 44 players listed (excluding suspended players),
only seven are seniors.
</P>
<P>
   At outside linebacker, true freshman Asi Faoa has moved ahead of
junior Santi Hall, a converted defensive end who was suspended from
spring practice for violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with Asi, and Santi did not participate in
spring,'' Toledo said. ``He was working on academics, and I'm
trying to make a point with him. He'd better buckle down.''
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, a senior, is the No. 1 split end. Last year's starter,
junior Poli-Dixon, had a shoddy first week but played well in
Saturday's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Other depth-chart developments: Freshman Mike Seidman, from
Westlake High, is the No. 4 tight end, although that could change
when Seidman learns the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is starting over Jermaine Lewis at tailback, and with
Durell Price suspended, Matt Stanley is the No. 1 fullback.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension-depleted offensive line features (from left
tackle to right tackle) freshman Blake Worley, senior Matt Phelan,
sophomore Troy Danoff, freshman Mike Saffer and junior Brian Polak.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Joey Strycula, the holder, is starting at free safety,
while freshman Joe Hunter and senior Jason Bell are the first-team
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Holland and Ken Kocher are the No. 1 defensive tackles,
with Anthony Fletcher and Steve Morgan in close pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Rusty Williams is starting at Hall's defensive end spot
opposite Kenyon Coleman. Williams' performance may determine
whether Hall moves back to end when the suspended linebackers
return.

EDITORIAL: CONGRESSIONAL MYOPIA ON FOREIGN AID
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid is not among Washington's most popular causes. But
it happens to be one of the more effective investments in long-term
global security that America can make. Yet Congress now proposes to
cut some $2 billion from President Clinton's already modest $14.6
billion foreign aid request for next year, much of it from crucial
crisis prevention programs. When the foreign aid bill goes to a
House-Senate conference committee next month, the Republican
congressional leadership should work to reverse these shortsighted
cuts. What cannot be restored then should be included in a
supplemental foreign aid bill later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Today's foreign aid dollars can help prevent tomorrow's wars, as
Clinton noted in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars earlier
this month. That surely applies to $1.3 billion promised to Israel
and the Palestinian Authority for meeting the security costs of the
Wye peace agreement and improving the living standards of the
Palestinian people. Yet for the second budget year, Congress has
withheld financing for this program.
</P>
<P>
   There are also obvious dividends for American security in
programs designed to help Russia dismantle its Cold War nuclear
arsenal, safeguard bomb plutonium and employ former weapons
scientists in new fields. Yet both the House and Senate want to
impose steep cuts in these areas and would also trim money for
supporting reform in other former Soviet states. The House would
also cut appropriations for World Bank aid to the very poorest
countries and continues to hold up paying America's back dues to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Some American foreign aid money has been wasted in the past. But
that is no reason to starve the entire program. congressional
opponents argue that approving Clinton's full request for foreign
aid would violate current budget caps. But such arguments never
stop legislators eager to add defense funding or vote unwise tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing nuclear dangers in Russia, supporting peace agreements
in the Middle East and Africa and helping the poor emerge from
poverty are sound investments. Congress should heed Clinton's
appeal and providing adequate money for these programs this fall.

OFFICIALS BACK HATE CRIME UNITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Reacting to the racist shooting rampage in the
San Fernando Valley, state legislators, district attorneys and
religious leaders threw support behind a bill Monday that would
earmark $5 million to add and train hate crime prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Under AB 741, the money would be used to assign individual
prosecutors to handle every stage of a hate crime case. In small
counties plagued by hate crimes, the money could be used to
establish hate crime prosecution units and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes are an assault on an entire community _ they
injure every one of us,'' Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys,
said after a news conference to rally support for the legislation.
``That's why we all must work together to combat crimes of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti also urged bipartisan
support for the bill, authored by Assemblyman Rod Pacheco,
R-Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This funding could significantly help the Los Angeles County
DA's office expand its hate crime prosecution unit,'' said Jim
Provenza, Garcetti's legislative liaison in Sacramento. ``Our five
DAs in the unit now are overworked. We have one-third of the
state's population in Los Angeles and a proportionate amount of
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need this funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco said the arson fires at three synagogues in Sacramento
this year, the killing of two gay men in Redding and, most
recently, the Valley shooting rampage are the types of ``horrors''
that inspired the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As racial acts of violence continue, we must better equip our
police and prosecutors, ensuring these criminals are punished to
the fullest extent of the law,'' Pacheco said.
</P>
<P>
   Provenza said the success in such legislation in the past is an
indication that the funding is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill really addresses the fact that you can better
prosecute cases with a specialized DA,'' Provenza said. ``It has
worked dramatically on sex crimes and domestic violence. There's no
question it will work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting the bill was Sacramento County District Attorney
Jan Scully, rabbis from the Congregation Beth Shalom, and members
of Crime Victims United of California.

DEFENSE IS FEELING DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC's defense is fed up with hearing that it is
the team's question mark, especially after stuffing the offense
during much of last weekend's first scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are mad,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said. ``We have
a lot of guys returning and people say the defense is the
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one of those is USC coach Paul Hackett, who said the
defense had ``flip-flopped'' roles with the offense, which now has
the most experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been saying the defense is the weakness, but still the
offense can't do much on us,'' Moreno said. ``We hope we can
continue that in (the season opener against) Hawaii. We have
something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell update: Although Hackett hopes to hear some news today,
there is a growing feeling that USC might not get junior college
transfer Craig Mitchell at all this season.
</P>
<P>
   USC needs the wide receiver's JC transcripts before the school
year starts next week, and nothing happened Monday that got
Mitchell any closer to completing the necessary paperwork. If the
paperwork is not completed this week, Mitchell will be ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does show up, it will be nearly impossible for him to
crack into the top-five receiver rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Nazel to play: Hackett announced that freshman Omar Nazel of
Oakland has moved from linebacker to defensive end and will not
redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he will contribute immediately,'' Hackett said.
``If a guy like Omar can rush the passer and play special teams,
that's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't all good for Nazel. He sprained his foot in
practice Monday and underwent X-rays. His status for the rest of
the week was not determined.
</P>
<P>
   Man of Steele: Linebacker Markus Steele had his first day of
contact and didn't look too rusty, shutting down several running
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of plays I was happy with,'' Steele said. ``It
felt real good to go out there and make contact with a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele has set his sights on winning the starting weakside
linebacker position by the season opener Sept. 4 against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main goal,'' Steele said. ``To get a starting
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele is contesting sophomores Henry Wallace and Darryl Knight
for the starting weakside position. Knight has been suspended from
the Hawaii game, however, for poor academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Scrimmage time: USC will hold a closed scrimmage at the Coliseum
today, its final scrimmage of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said a focus from an offensive standpoint will be wide
receivers Windrell Hayes and Marcell Allmond, who were injured and
missed all or most of the first scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Frank Strong, who sat out the first scrimmage with a
bruised thigh, will also play today.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will also be put to the test, practicing a majority
of time against only the first-and-second string offense.

 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Some four hours before Monday night's series opener at
Shea Stadium, Jeff Bagwell had a bitter, painful flashback.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bagwell opened the Astros' clubhouse door at Shea only to find
the small, dank visitor's locker room overcome with what looked
like more reporters than there were fans at Pro Player Stadium in
Florida only two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this, 1986 all over again?'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the night looked something like it. It felt something
like it. It sounded something like it.
</P>
<P>
   And unfortunately for the Astros, at least in the opener of this
potentially huge three-game set against the Mets, it ended
something like it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets came up clutch, while the Astros let one slip away in
the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have a prejudiced point of view, but they hit two
balls off the handle that happened to fall fair in the inning,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said of the 3-2 Mets win. ``It was
lucky. That's all it was, really.''
</P>
<P>
   And, really, luck might well have had something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Astros starter Scott Elarton wiggled out of a few
jams through eight innings, while Matt Mieske slammed a long ball
and Carl Everett added a practically Hatcher-esque clutch shot in
the seventh to send the game into the ninth tied at two.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were in a good spot, and reliever Jay Powell seemed
to be hitting his spots well enough. Better still, by the time the
Astros stepped to the plate in the ninth, the outfield scoreboard
showed a 6-2 Braves win over the division-contending Reds, and the
Astros seemed to have the incentive to do something huge.
</P>
<P>
   Things hardly could have looked better. There were two Astros on
and two out, but then Lance Berkman struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be tight against those guys,'' Bagwell
said. ``How much tighter can it get than 2-2 in the bottom of the
ninth? We were right there.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, oh, the luck. Mets center fielder Darryl Hamilton got
the Mets going when he doubled down the line after getting jammed
and breaking his bat on the pitch from Powell. Two batters later,
pinch hitter Matt Franco blooped a two-out single between Mieske
and diving shortstop Tim Bogar in short left field.
</P>
<P>
   Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's like we always say: You don't want to be good;
you just want to be lucky,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said.
``There was a weird, weird set of events in that inning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed weird. You might even want to call it lucky.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros have to realize that they have been the
unluckiest and seen the weirdest of occurrences happen in the games
they most needed to win. That perception needs to change, and time
is running out if it's going to happen before the playoffs _
assuming there is a postseason for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Astros' first try against one of the other
contending NL teams _ Cincinnati, Atlanta, Arizona and New York _
since getting swept in three games at Atlanta two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   This was a chance to begin turning things in their favor against
the good teams. But it ended much the same way as so many others.
Since June 14, the Astros have dropped 17 of their last 21 games
against the Reds, Diamondbacks, Braves and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has just been bad luck. But with only 26 games
remaining in the season and seven of those against the Mets and
Reds, the Astros not only need to find a way to start changing
their luck, they need to secure a playoff berth, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just want to get in,'' Biggio said. ``We're not
looking at who we're playing. We just want to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a bad Astros performance by any stretch. But it was
not good. This was not a self-inflicted loss like pretty much all
three were in Atlanta two weeks ago. But it was a loss nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, given the electric atmosphere and hostile crowd, the
Astros handled the conditions well.
</P>
<P>
   There were at least as many fistfights in the stands as there
were runs scored. The tone of the night was set early, when a
tribute to Mets outfielder Bobby Bonilla played on the big screen
and it was was resoundingly booed.
</P>
<P>
   The 39,292 fans were on their feet for every pitch in the final
innings and shouted more than a few obscenities in the Astros'
direction. Tensions were high.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, the Astros looked unshakable, coming back
from the 2-0 deficit, getting the strong effort from Elarton and
playing solid defense throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it gets when they have winning teams here,'' said
Biggio, who grew up within shouting distance of the big city.
``This is what you get. This is getting to be like it was in the
mid-'80s.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like it. It was the perfect stage on which the Astros
could have made a big statement. Instead, they just had an ugly
flashback.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Hundreds of Albanians with tractors, cars
and trucks spread out across a hillside and for a mile along a
winding road Monday, blocking an advance column of Russian
peacekeepers from moving in to take charge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, mostly young men, but also families with young
children, bore placards in Albanian and English that read
``Russians killed us,'' and ``We don't trust Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long day on the isolated road, where cars and trucks
wound up into the hills beyond their blockade, they showed no signs
of backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them here because they fought here on the side
of the Serbs,'' said Vesel Vehapi, a farmer from a nearby village.
``We are scared of them from what happened before, and there is no
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have said Russian mercenaries fought beside the
Serbian militias in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Orahovac is one of the most tortured areas in Kosovo and as
such, a microcosm of the province's agony and continuing
insecurity. The area has the greatest concentration of mass graves
_ 75 in an area of 4 square miles _ and was where more than 1,000
people were massacred during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping officials say it also has the largest concentration
of war-crimes suspects still living in Kosovo, local Serbs who have
been named by witnesses and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of these Serbs, and others like them, is at the heart
of a tension that has been simmering in Kosovo since the end of the
war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
in the Hague has handed down indictments against major Serbian
figures, like President Slobodan Milosevic, and sent scores of
investigators to the province to gather those cases.
</P>
<P>
   But many Albanians are interested in more personal, and pressing
questions, suspecting their former neighbors of burning their homes
and killing their relatives and eager for the kind of detailed
accounting the tribunal has no intention of providing them.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Tony van Loon, who commands the Dutch task force here,
said there are dozens of suspected war criminals in the Serbian
quarter and in a nearby Serbian village, Velika Hoca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frenzy of killing,'' said Lt. Col. Tony van Loon, who
commands the Dutch task force here, referring to March and April
when violence by Serbs was frequent. ``People were shot in the legs
and then burned when their house was set on fire. A baby was found
with its head chopped off. There is tremendous rage among the
Albanians when they find their family members dead when they
return.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Monday, inside the Albanian blockade, within an even
tighter blockade of Dutch troops, the city's 2,500 Serbs live in a
small cluster of narrow steep streets, clustered around the Serbian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   They are the source of much of the tension, and the main reason
behind the Albanians' aversion to letting Russian troops deploy in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch troops guard the ends of the streets with huge
self-propelled guns pointing outwards. They are guarding the Serbs
from attacks by vengeful Albanians, but they are also preventing
the Serbs from leaving, to make sure the war-crimes suspects living
there do not escape. Only a few Serbs are allowed to leave each
day, taken out under the protection of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the quarter, which the residents themselves liken to a
ghetto, there is a dead, dispirited air, but also a lingering trace
of menace. People hang around the streets buying or selling a few
vegetables or sweets. Young men in tracksuits swagger along with
nowhere to go. Older men sit on street corners and question
strangers as to who they are and what they want.
</P>
<P>
   According to van Loon, there are dozens of suspected war
criminals in the Serbian quarter and in a nearby Serbian village,
Velika Hoca.
</P>
<P>
   The tension soared on Friday when Dutch troops received orders
to hand over the sector to Russian peacekeepers and move east to
another area in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time they got the go ahead to arrest three local
Serbian leaders, which they did without incident, with the help of
German military police. They had been investigating the three men
in connection with war-crimes accusations for some time and had
been watching their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the wives and relatives of the three arrested men were
cloistered in the walled garden of a house in the Serbian quarter,
looking scared and trapped. They said they had not been informed of
what, if anything, the men had been charged with.
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Kolasinac said she had no idea why her husband, Andjelko
Kolasinac, the mayor of Orahovac, had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no responsibility for mobilization during the war. He
was only involved in things like the water supply, and the
electricity supply. The reason he stayed behind was because he did
not do anything bad, and that can be confirmed by 90 percent of
Albanians, if they are honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever committed the crimes, they have run away. Only the
innocent are left behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Simic said the same about her husband, Vekoslav Simic, 37,
the former chief of the town hospital and for the last two months
the only working doctor in the Serbian quarter. ``He was involved
in humanitarian things, not politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The third man arrested was Stanislav Levic, who worked at a
flour mill.
</P>
<P>
   The order to arrest the men came from the U.N. mission in
Kosovo, said Capt. Mike Bos, spokesman for the Dutch task force
here. U.N. police and a representative of the international war
crimes tribunal from the Hague were present during the arrest, a
German policeman confirmed, and Bos said the arrests were made
based on evidence collected by tribunal investigators. But no
charges or indictments have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the leaders,'' the policeman said of the three men.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The men appear to have aided and even orchestrated the campaign
of ethnic cleansing in and around the town of Orahovac. As
community leaders they are expected to be charged with organizing
the campaign, rather than doing the killing themselves, said Fehmi
Cena, chief pediatrician at the town hospital and acting president
of the Albanian-run Council for Human Rights in Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both Kolasinac and Simic worked with the military and were seen
in uniform during the war, he said. Kolasinac, the mayor, was a
more reasonable type, Cena said. ``At least you could talk to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simic, the doctor, was a known extremist, he said. ``The
people think that he is one of the Serb chauvinists who created
ethnic cleansing of Orahovac,'' Cena said. ``He examined many of
the bodies of those killed during this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men were taken to the southern town of Prizren and are
thought to be still there, where the families understand they will
be detained pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if the men have or will be removed to the Hague
for trial. Their arrest brings the number of people detained on
suspicion of having committed war crimes in Kosovo to about 15.
There are more Serbian suspects in both Orahovac and Velika Hoca
under investigation, Dutch and German officers confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs will remain blockaded in their own ghetto, trapped
with their own horrors. A woman called to reporters from her
upstairs room that her son was kidnapped two months ago. ``I want
to tell you, it is all the fault of the evil, nationalist politics
of Slobodan Milosevic,'' she said, weeping into a handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the Serbs say they want to leave for Serbia, but
for now they are stuck. The Russians, when they come, are unlikely
to help them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Russians are stuck too. An advance unit drove
several times up toward the protesters Monday and then turned back.
Their commanders were negotiating with Dutch and German troops and
local community leaders, they said.
</P>
<P>
   When they do arrive in Orahovac, they will inherit a cauldron of
tension. ``The situation is very difficult,'' said a German
military policeman on duty in the Serb quarter. ``The Albanians are
scared, the Serbs are scared, and the two communities hate each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Loon, in an interview last week, said, ``Anyone who expects
the enmity to end between the Serbs and the Albanians is a wild
optimist.'' And the political decision to send Russian troops here
will complicate things further. ``It will set us a whole lot of
steps back,'' he warned.

YANKEES BLAST RANGERS, 21-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This could be the Texas Rangers' best team in
their 28-year history, and yet their public _ especially the
gathering who attended Monday night's embarrassment at The Ballpark
in Arlington _ seems to have a hard time getting excited about this
ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, the Rangers simply won't allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees applied yet another good, ol'-fashioned
country beating to the Rangers, and this 21-3 eyesore likely
convinced more of the masses that this postseason will be no
different than the previous two for Arlington's best.
</P>
<P>
   Must the Rangers offer their public some hope of beating the
defending World Series champions in the postseason to gain better
support than Monday night's gathering of 38,024?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Rangers left fielder Rusty Greer said.
``You're asking the wrong person there. All we can do is go out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who eliminated the Rangers' during the 1996 and '98
Division Series, wasted no time establishing their superiority with
a six-run first inning against right-hander John Burkett (4-7).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the evening was only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost to the Yankees for the 18th time in 26
regular-season games since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees amassed a season-high 23 hits en route to 21 runs,
which were the most ever allowed by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Nos. 8 and 9 hitters _ third baseman Scott Brosius
and catcher Joe Girardi _ experienced their most explosive evenings
in terms of run production. Girardi went 4-for-6 and drove in a
career-best seven runs. Brosius went 4-for-6 and drove in a
career-best six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett surrendered as many runs (eight) as outs recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers left-hander Mike Venafro and right-hander Danny
Patterson each surrendered five runs on five hits during their
one-inning appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I don't have any answers,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``I know we made a lot of bad pitches, and they put a
lot of good swings on the ball. That's a bad combination. You put
it to bed and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers provided few highlights.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro hit his eighth home run in as many
games with his two-run, second-inning blast off left-hander Andy
Pettitte (11-9), and right-hander Tim Crabtree pitched a 1-2-3
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rangers _ one and all _ displayed their best short-term
memories in the clubhouse afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored 21 runs,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``It was
over awhile ago. We'll just come back tomorrow. We've done it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Monday night's events put a temporary halt on the
Rangers' recent run, which included a three-game sweep of Boston
and winning three of four from the Central Division-leading
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be asleep in an hour,'' Oates said after the game.
``We've played good baseball. We know we've got a good team. We'll
come back tomorrow and tee it up again. This wasn't the first time,
and it won't be the last time.'' nn

PENA SUSPENDED WHILE DOWN IN ALBUQUERQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Angel Pena is hailed as the future catcher of the
Los Angeles Dodgers, but he was sent to the minors earlier because
of lackadaisical play and a poor work ethic. Now, he's been
suspended for seven games from Triple-A Albuquerque for violating
team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he hasn't had a chance to
talk with Pena, nor Albuquerque manager Mike Scioscia, so he didn't
want to discuss how this could affect a Sept. 1 call-up.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, 24, is considered one of the top catching prospects in
baseball. But he raised some eyebrows when, with the Dodgers'
backup job on the line, he arrived at spring training overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball officials have expressed concern whether Pena will
be anything more than a major-league backup because they don't
think he has the work ethic necessary to develop into an everyday
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension went into effect Sunday and limits Pena's
involvement with the team. Bill Geivett, Dodgers assistant to the
general manager/director of player personnel, handed down the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel Pena violated team rules that are consistent with the
major-league rules,'' Geivett said. ``It's something we're going to
handle internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Geivett and Dodgers senior vice president Tom Lasorda went to
Albuquerque and talked with Pena. He hasn't played since Aug. 10,
when he strained his elbow making a throw. Geivett wouldn't
elaborate on the situation, but sources said Pena's talking back
wore on the coaching staff while general manager Kevin Malone was
in town to watch Albuquerque in preparation for Sept. 1 call-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Johnson said earlier this season they were confident
Pena could be the Dodgers' everyday catcher if Todd Hundley was
injured, and Pena got that chance when Hundley spent 11 days
working with coach Rick Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   Pena didn't impress. He hit .208 and struck out 24 times in 120
at-bats. He also rarely came to the ballpark early for extra
hitting with the other backup players. Pena also committed three
errors and had four passed balls.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing Pena's demotion earlier this month, Johnson said,
``I was seeing balls get by him and I saw him dropping balls. I
said, `I have a higher set of standards for you.' I said, `Go out,
come back and be the kind of catcher you can be. You showed signs
you can do things up here, but you also showed signs you're not
ready to be one of the most valuable players on the field. ... It
looked like you didn't want it that bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hair-raising experience: How revered is Dodgers right-hander
Chan Ho Park in his native Korea? Well, Park had his head shaved by
his brother last week, but it wasn't done until 4 a.m. because the
two were debating the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut my hair off to show I have control of myself,'' Park
said. ``So many people look at me back in Korea. I couldn't cut it,
but that's the wrong thinking. I thought that before I did it. I
was scared to cut my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end: Johnson said right-hander Robinson Checo, on the
disabled list since July 29 with a right groin strain, will be
re-examined because he's still experiencing discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're talking that it could be some kind of rupture,
real mild,'' Johnson said. ``It's not healing. I was hoping we'd
had him back. I'd like to look at him again.'' ... The Dodgers and
Albuquerque signed a one-year player development contract to keep
the Triple-A affiliate in New Mexico.... Johnson said the Dodgers
may promote minor-league pitcher Greg Gagne or Jeff Williams later
this week. ``We can look at all the options available to us this
year that might impact us next year,'' Johnson said.... Monday's
game was delayed 2 hours, 10 minutes by rain.... For the second
straight day Jose Vizcaino started at third in place of ailing
Adrian Beltre (ankle).

EDITORIAL: BOND ACT MISCHIEF
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The mass confusion caused by Albany's annual last-minute budget
scrambles often provides camouflage for mischievous legislation
that nobody notices until well after the deed is done. This year
was no exception. The budget passed earlier this month includes
subtle changes in the rules governing the disposition of certain
money under the 1996 environmental bond act.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the changes are fundamentally at odds with
the spirit of the act because they would divert money that was
originally aimed at fighting water pollution to economic
development. Spokesmen for Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority
leader, who inserted the new language, say the changes are minor.
Even the most cursory textual analysis suggests that the
environmentalists are right.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is $30 million in money earmarked under the bond act's
implementing legislation to help small businesses attain
``compliance with environmental laws and regulations or other
pollution avoidance activities.'' In plain language, this meant
that the purpose of the money was to help small businesses remove
pollution from their wastewater, through new technology or other
means. Bruno's revision deletes any reference to ``small
businesses'' and adds a provision allowing the $30 million to be
spent on ``water or wastewater infrastructure.'' Again, in plain
language, this means that the money could now be used by cities and
towns to expand their water supplies to accommodate new business
activity by large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's main motive is to encourage economic development in
upstate New York by providing industry with a secure water supply,
a commendable and defensible objective. What is neither commendable
nor defensible is the fact that he wants to pay for new water
supplies with money that was designed to clean up existing water
supplies. Furthermore, when the citizens of New York approved the
$1.75 billion Clean Air, Clean Water Bond Act three years ago, they
were voting to clean up the environment, not to subsidize new
industry. There are other programs for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the State Assembly nor Gov. George Pataki objected to
the new language, though they should have. Both felt bound by an
unofficial agreement giving the Republican Senate, the Democratic
Assembly and the governor discretionary authority over slices of
the bond act money. The Assembly has so far spent much of its slice
to replace old coal-fired boilers in New York City's public
schools. That is clearly consistent with the bond act's
environmental purposes. Bruno's disposition of his slice of the pie
is not.

L.A. BID UNDER NFL'S REVIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NFL expansion committee is scheduled to meet
Sept. 9 in Washington, D.C., to review Los Angeles' mired bid to
acquire the league's 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is not expected to take any formal action six days
prior to the deadline the NFL gave Los Angeles to finalize its
expansion bid. But it hopes to evaluate the process on the
deadline's eve so it can later make a recommendation to the full
ownership at an Oct. 6 meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The committee could meet again before, or simply have a
conference call, to finalize its recommendation prior to the full
membership meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated because of a lack of public funding to assist the
Coliseum expansion bid, the NFL announced earlier this month it
would no longer deal exclusively with the Exposition Park site
prior to the Sept. 15 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   That gave new life to former prospective sites at the city of
Carson and Hollywood Park, if little opportunity to finalize
11th-hour bids prior to the deadline. In Orange County, there has
been discussion of a stadium in the El Toro area, and Padres owner
John Moores has approached the league about a possible stadium in
the Irvine area.
</P>
<P>
   No longer maidens when it comes to dealing with the NFL, Carson
city officials are taking a guarded approach to their latest
contact with the league.
</P>
<P>
   With the L.A. Coliseum proposal for an expansion team teetering
over public-money demands, league officials have asked Carson for a
letter of interest regarding an expansion franchise and stadium
site. The league has made the same request of city officials at two
other possible sites, in Inglewood (Hollywood Park) and Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Carson city councilman Daryl Sweeney said the city will submit a
letter of interest, ``but no one plans to get optimistic,'' he
said. ``There has been contact, but it's just been generalities.
They want to know if we're still interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Coliseum is remotely close to a comprehensive, final
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles area and state officials have been trying to rescue
the Coliseum bid with a new plan for subsidizing parking
construction at Exposition Park. The plan now being discussed would
allow the team to keep parking revenue, with the parking structures
being paid off by incremental taxes generated by the team and games
played at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, bonds were proposed for the structures that would be
paid off largely from game-parking fees. NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said the league was concerned if the team was not allowed
to collected the parking fees _ in addition to paying a proposed $5
million-per-year stadium lease _ it would be difficult for it to be
financially successful in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When the league established the Sept. 15 deadline for Los
Angeles, it said if the city failed to finalize an acceptable bid
that Houston would be awarded a team. &QL;

YANKS BLAST RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This series between the New York Yankees and
the Texas Rangers is being touted as a possible playoff preview. If
that's the case, the Rangers might want concede the baseball and
challenge the Yankees to checkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees crushed the Rangers Monday night, 21-3, while
totaling 23 hits, the most hits by the Yankees since Aug. 25, 1984;
it was the most runs ever allowed by the Rangers. Joe Girardi drove
in seven runs on four hits, Scott Brosius had four hits and six
runs batted in, and Tino Martinez had four hits and four RBI. No
Texas pitchers were hurt, but all were thoroughly embarrassed,
combining for 199 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of those games when everything steamrolls and
every ball you hit finds a hole,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Joe Torre, ``It's not like you're trying to rub it
in, but you just can't go up to the plate and stand there.''
</P>
<P>
   This region recorded 24 consecutive days of temperature over 100
degrees, a phenomenon manifested in the hardness of infield within
the Ballpark in Arlington. The dirt has been baked, and ground
balls skitter along the infield as if bouncing on a polished
gymnasium floor. Most rollers skip through the infield for hits, a
partial explanation for the 33 hits posted by both teams Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas pitching staff can take most of the credit, however,
for it succeeded in revitalizing the Yankees' offense. The Yankees
had averaged about three runs a game for a week and a half, most of
their regulars imbedded in offensive slumps. ``We better start
scoring some runs,'' Shane Spencer said Sunday, looking ahead to
the Texas series, ``or the Rangers are going to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are a great offensive team, ranked second in the
league in runs scored, and over all they are better than last year,
Torre said before the game. ``It's because they're playing
defense,'' he said. ``Yesterday, I investigated it a little bit,
and that's the difference; it makes the pitching better.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the additions of first baseman Rafael Palmeiro and
the All-Star reliever Jeff Zimmerman, even with the luxury of
having Todd Zeile and Royce Clayton for a full season, there is a
basic truth at the heart of any series between Texas and the
Yankees: the Rangers' starting pitching, stacked with right-handers
possessing mediocre stuff, creates a feeding frenzy among the
Yankees' left-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Even their right-handed batters feasted on the slop John Burkett
threw Monday night. After Chuck Knoblauch walked to lead off the
game, Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams and Martinez singled, Martinez
driving in two runs. Ricky Ledee walked before Brosius and Girardi
_ the Yankees most deeply mired in slumps _ hit back-to-back
singles, Brosius driving in a run, Girardi two.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brosius' first hit with a runner in scoring position
since Aug. 8, Girardi's first since July 28. The Yankees led, 6-0,
after a half inning, and if the Rangers had carried over any
confidence from their consecutive victories against the Yankees in
June, it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (11-9) gave up a two-run home run to Palmeiro in
the second inning and began pitching tentatively; admittedly
distracted by the presence of family when he pitches in Texas,
Pettitte had never beaten the Rangers in this park before,
compiling an 0-3 record with a 16.05 earned run average. But the
Yankees' hitters kept slamming away at Burkett and the relievers
who followed. ``It only took 21 runs and five years for me to get a
win here,'' Pettitte joked later.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee and Girardi drove in runs in the second inning, Burkett
departing after Girardi's hit. So began a parade of Texas
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi drove in another run in the fifth; Yankees 9, Texas 2.
In the sixth, Brosius bashed a three-run home run to cap a five-run
rally; Yankees 14, Texas 2. In the seventh, both teams began using
bench players, but that didn't slow the flood of Yankee runs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams doubled home a run, and after a walk and another
run-scoring single by Brosius, the bases were loaded for Girardi _
who smashed a line drive into the right-center-field gap, his
triple clearing the bases. The day after catcher Jorge Posada had a
double, triple and home run and came within a single of having the
first cycle by a Yankees catcher in 59 years, Girardi had a single,
double and triple. Yankees 19, Rangers 2.
</P>
<P>
   There would be one last outburst. Luis Sojo doubled to open the
top of the eighth, and with two outs, Martinez blasted a two-run
homer, accounting for the last hit and runs for the Yankees. They
went down in order in the ninth, the last out made by Knoblauch,
who had seven plate appearances, drawing two walks while going 0
for 5 and making the last out in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, scheduled to start Tuesday, rolled his eyes at
Knoblauch to make a facetious pitcher's lament: you scored all
those runs on a night I didn't pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only one thinking about you,'' Knoblauch said. ``I'm
getting my five hits tomorrow.''

`REPUBLIC' COLUMNIST'S DISMISSAL A STORY OF UNTRACEABLE SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID PARRISH, MICHAEL MURPHY  and MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For five years, Julie Amparano was one of the most
respected writers at ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   When she became the paper's Life section columnist in July, she
quickly wrote a string of poignant and compelling true-life stories
about people in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   There was the White racist who at 25 discovered he was half
Hispanic. The gay man living in an intolerant neighborhood. The
upscale woman visiting the downscale restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, Amparano was fired last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a front page note to its readers on Saturday, ``The
Republic'' revealed that some of the people quoted in Amparano's
column were untraceable.
</P>
<P>
   During two days of searching last week, ``Republic'' editors
reviewed 11 out of 17 of Amparano's thrice-weekly columns she wrote
since July. A total of 65 people were identified in the columns.
The editors had questions on about 40 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 24 had uncommon names and were checked out. Four were
found.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the people named in the columns couldn't be traced,
including the former racist, the gay man and the upscale diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel embarrassed and chagrined about this,'' Deputy Managing
Editor John D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth could these columns have gotten into the paper?''
Senior Features Editor Susan Felt asked herself.
</P>
<P>
   Felt oversees the paper's Life section, and D'Anna is her
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano, 39, denied that some of the people in her column were
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there; I went to different places of the town,
looking for people from different walks of life, and they're
real,'' Amparano said Monday morning while being interviewed on
KTAR-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're saying that I should have seen the driver's license
. . . well, that changes the rules of the game. But I did what I
was told to do. I was told to be a fly on the wall, get
conversations, bring them into the paper, and that's what I've
done,'' Amparano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken people's names down, what they told me they did,
and put them in the pages of `The Republic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has just been very unfair, very unfair to my name
and credibility, and I'm out to prove it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano later issued a statement saying she was given
inadequate time, less than 24 hours, to produce the requested
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the demand was unfair from the onset,'' she
said. ``Nonetheless, all of my sources were credible and real
individuals with firsthand knowledge about the subjects they
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   While being questioned by editors last week, Amparano
steadfastly denied any fabrication of people or events,
``Republic'' Managing Editor Julia Wallace and D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people quoted in her column, she told the editors,
were found while she was out in the community _ at parks,
bookstores or on street corners _ and could not be readily traced.
</P>
<P>
   D'Anna said he now views in a different light Amparano's
stories, which were filled with insightful quotes from everyday
people and powerful tales of injustice and racism in the Phoenix
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read things that were too good to be true,'' said D'Anna,
a friend of Amparano's for nearly 20 years. ``In hindsight, the
fact we were getting something that was so new and different and
fit so well into our goals, yeah, it clouded my judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations leveled against Amparano also raised concerns at
``The Republic'' about how well editors and reporters adhere to
journalistic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who joined the ``Republic'' last December, said the
newspaper's staff needs to have a long conversation about ethics,
standards and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we do not have enough safeguards in place to
prevent something like this from happening,'' Wallace said. ``Every
time something like this happens, it eats away at what we all
do.'' &QL; 
MEDIA EMBARRASSMENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amparano's firing is the latest in a string of embarrassments
for the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ``Boston Globe'' columnist Patricia Smith was fired
for making up people and quotes, and another ``Globe'' columnist,
Mike Barnicle, resigned under suspicion that he had fabricated a
column about two children hospitalized with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Republic'' magazine writer Stephen Glass was fired because
of allegations that his articles contained 47 fabrications. The
``Cincinnati Enquirer'' fired a reporter who used stolen voice mail
to create what the paper later called ``untrue'' stories about
Chiquita Brands International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Arizona Republic,'' the accusations against Amparano
represent perhaps the biggest public embarrassment since publisher
Darrow ``Duke'' Tully was forced to resign in 1985 after it was
disclosed that his 30-year military career was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Deni Elliott, director of the practical ethics center at the
University of Montana, said the news industry is largely to blame
for fabrications because of what gets rewarded and noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pressure in every newsroom to find the right quote,
to create stories, columns that fit together in a way that is
aesthetically pleasing,'' said Elliott, who has been a reporter and
ethics coach at the ``Philadelphia Enquirer.''``'' &QL; 
REASSESSED SYSTEMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after Glass and Smith were fired by their
publications, ``Republic'' Reader Advocate Richard de Uriarte wrote
that the paper was reassessing its internal systems of
fact-checking and editorial review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we let some things slide into the newspaper, perhaps
because the writing was so compelling, so entertaining, that it
just had to be shared?'' de Uriarte asked in his 1998 column.
</P>
<P>
   After Wallace joined the paper last December, she started a
credibility committee. Reporters and editors have so far reviewed
the paper's corrections policy and discussed issues such as
stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   De Uriarte said the committee has been developing feedback
surveys that will be sent randomly to people quoted in the paper,
asking whether they were quoted correctly and whether the story was
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to get it started this summer,'' de Uriarte said,
``but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With any safeguard system, editors still have to trust reporters
to act professionally, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's practical for editors to re-report and
fact-check every story,'' he said. ``Editors do, however, have an
incredible responsibility to make sure _ and this is for the
reporter's protection, too _ that the facts are there as they
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano had been one of ``The Republic's'' stars. Editors raved
about her work _ the ability to tell human stories through the eyes
of everyday people. Being Hispanic made her success all the more
sweet for the newspaper as it tried to appeal to more of the area's
growing Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was getting such good stuff,'' Wallace said. ``She was
really connecting with people, especially in the minority
community.'' &QL; 
A SOLID CAREER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining ``The Republic'' five years ago, Amparano had
put together a solid journalism career, including working at the
Associated Press, the ``Philadelphia Daily News'' and the ``Wall
Street Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano is Region 7 director of the National Association of
Hispanic Journalists _ an organization with 1,700 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street Journal'' editor Roger Rickless supervised
Amparano _ then Julie Amparano Lopez _ when she wrote on management
and workplace issues from the paper's New York bureau in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly were no ethical issues (that) arose during
that time,'' said Rickless, now Canada editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schiffman, who edited Amparano's stories when she worked
for the Associated Press's San Francisco bureau in the mid-1980s,
said he didn't recall any questions being raised about her work.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is Amparano's hometown, and she returned to be closer to
her family, D'Anna said. &QL; 
COWORKERS REACT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A popular and engaging person, Amparano's dismissal was greeted
by editors and reporters with a mixture of shock, disbelief and
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed because I had high hopes for her
column and future work,'' said Pam Johnson, executive editor and
vice president for news at ``The Republic.'' ``What a
disappointment to the newspaper and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Graciela Sevilla said she hasn't seen any proof that
convinces her that Amparano made up people in her columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known and worked with her for five years, and I can't
think of another reporter I know who has higher ethical standards
than Julie. So this seems incredibly far-fetched to me,'' Sevilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Amparano is involved in local and national journalism
organizations, and has frequently talked to younger reporters about
the importance of journalistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that she's a very capable and talented
journalist. So I don't see why she would have a need to do
something like this,'' Sevilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Richard Ruelas, who belongs to two Hispanic
journalists' organizations with Amparano, wasn't sure what to make
of the paper's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're completely out of character to the person I know _ In
my dealings with her, she was always professional and
hard-working,'' Ruelas said. ``I would like to think the paper I
work for did the right thing.'' &QL; 
``Republic'' photographer Paul F. Gero said he was shocked by
Amparano's firing: ``I've always known Julie to be a total
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Jodie Snyder said that in working with Amparano on at
least one story she had ``small doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the quotes did sound too good to be true.`` &QL; 
CONCERNS SPUR INQUIRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' editors began investigating Aug. 16 when a senior
newsroom staff member reported that there were rumors that Amparano
was making up some parts of her column. Reporters for other media
were possibly working on a story about it, the editors were told.
</P>
<P>
   The editors had their doubts, but decided to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I was still a believer (in Amparano),'' Wallace
said. ``I know there were a lot of people who were jealous that
Julie got the column. Maybe it was a smear job.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday afternoon, Wallace called Senior Editor David
Fritze to a private conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me her columns and pointed out that `Jennifer
Morgan' had appeared twice this year and a couple of times in (her)
stories several years ago,'' Fritze said. ``I was told to take
these columns and locate these people and see if they existed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fritze was metro editor, Amparano had been one of his
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired her and thought she had a lot of talent,'' Fritze
said. ``I had not seen anything in her columns to give me any
indications to question the integrity of her reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   That would quickly change.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he went through the columns and divided the names
into two groups.
</P>
<P>
   He bypassed investigating the first group, family members and
persons fully identicied by their organizations, reasoning that no
one would attempt to fabricate such people.
</P>
<P>
   The second list was of people who were identified only by a name
in the columns or with a vague job description.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Morgan _ both of them _ made the second list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to locate about 20 people,'' Fritze said.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he used phone books, operator directory assistance
and online services such as CDB Infoteck and AutoTrack that people
can be traced through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, worst case scenario, I run across some names
we can't track, but we find most people,'' Fritze said. ``As I went
along, I was stunned. I'd run name after name without getting any
hits.'' &QL; 
MISSING PERSONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because private investigators have broader access to state
government data, ``The Republic'' hired Scott Yeager of Faxon
Investigations to check 15 names through Motor Vehicle Department
records and voter registration files.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the investigations proved inconclusive. For example,
there were 31 other possible matches found for the name Susan Hall
_ identified in Amparano's Aug. 9 column as the down-and-out mother
of the 5-year-old boy who goes hungry every day.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he didn't have enough time to track down each of
those 32 Susan Halls, or other common names with multiple matches.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 15 names submitted to the private investigator, no
matches were found for 11 of them, ``Republic'' records show.
</P>
<P>
   That included Luis Adler Varela, the White racist who discovered
he was Hispanic, and Gus McDougal the gay man who was being
harassed by intolerant neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts also were raised about some names with numerous matches,
Fritze said.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano's July 19 column quoted a Jennifer Morgan, identified
only as someone outraged by the increased bombardment of commercial
advertisements at her dentist's office.
</P>
<P>
   Then in an Aug. 11 column, Amparano quoted a Jennifer Morgan,
identified as an attorney. The Arizona Bar Association lists no
such member.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in 1995, Amparano quoted in news stories individuals named
Jennifer Morgan. One was identified as an owner of a telephone
answering service, and another Jennifer Morgan was listed as an
advertising representative from Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' editors said Amparano could not provide them with
any way to contact any of the four different Jennifer Morgans.
</P>
<P>
   Editors said their doubts grew about the Aug. 9 column featuring
the hungry 5-year-old boy after reviewing a series of e-mail
messages that Amparano sent to readers inquiring how they could
help the family.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano said she could not locate the boy's mother, Susan Hall,
after the column ran, Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   To readers, Amparano gave conflicting responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family received tons of assistance. But if you still like
to help others, please call the Thomas Pappas Elementary School for
homeless children,'' Amparano e-mailed one reader on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 minutes after the first message, however, Amparano sent
this e-mail to another reader: ``The community outpour (sic) has
been overwhelming. I am trying to get a hold of Susan Hall, her
phone has been disconnected. I will let you know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano's e-mails were acquired as part of ``The Republic's''
internal investigation. &QL; 
OTHER QUESTIONS &QL; 
D'Anna said other questions surfaced while questioning Amparano.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano did not know the location of Crossroads Park in Gilbert
where she said she found and interviewed the gay man, Gus McDougal.
She told editors that she did nothing to verify that the man was
who he said he was, including getting his home address or phone
number, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave vague and varied answers on a Patricia Anderson, who
was identified in a column as a banker, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   The editors said they were told by Amparano that the interview
with Anderson took place at Bank One Plaza in downtown Phoenix.
When told no such person worked at Bank One, Amparano said that she
might have been mistaken and that Anderson could work for another
bank, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano could provide no phone number or address for Anderson,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' editors said they had several meetings last week
with Amparano, during which she was asked to prove phone numbers
and other details.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano did turn over some phone numbers, such as those
belonging to women quoted in a column about a Girl Scout trip that
Amparano and her daughter attended.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano also produced a phone number for Luis Adler Varela, the
White racist who belatedly discovered he was half Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he called the number several times, and finally a
woman answered who said she didn't know a Luis Adler Varela.
Further checking showed that the phone was listed to Amparano's
niece, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, Amparano met again with ``Republic''
management to go over the columns. D'Anna said she still could not
provide evidence that many of the people existed.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano asked for the weekend to locate people.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said she was inclined to grant that request. But as the
questioning proceeded, Wallace mentioned the niece's name and asked
Amparano whether she knew that person.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano hesitated, then denied she knew such a person, Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she is telling us her niece is not her niece, what's the
point? You can't believe anything she's saying,'' Wallace said. ``I
said `Julie, you're fired.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace gave three reasons for the firing: irresponsible
reporting; contradictory statements to editors during the
investigation; and inability to substantiate multiple people in her
column.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano said through her attorney, Stephen Montoya, that she
stands by all her stories. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ An evening full of electricity ended with all the spark
of a match flame, and the Astros wound up getting burned.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Franco lifted the New York Mets to a 3-2 victory over the
Astros with a ninth-inning bloop single into shallow left field
Monday night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing development of the inning occurred one
batter earlier, when Astros manager Larry Dierker directed reliever
Jay Powell to pitch around .263 hitter Rey Ordonez, thereby
bringing the pinch-hitting Franco to the plate and forcing
hard-throwing righthanded reliever Armando Benitez out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those situations where if Ordonez was willing to
swing at balls low and away, fine,'' said Dierker, who had Powell
intentionally walk Ordonez once the count got to 3-0. ``We wanted
to get Benitez out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After Franco's single, the Astros didn't have to worry about
facing Benitez or any other reliever, because the Mets had pulled
off their 13th last-at-bat victory and improved to 24-15 in one-run
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a little cat-and-mouse going on there,''
said Franco, who leads the Mets with 13 pinch hits and 10 RBIs off
the bench. ``It was fine managerial strategy from Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who offered his
opinion on the most talked-about decision of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a bad move,'' Valentine said. ``But it
didn't work out. He (Dierker) had (Jeff) Bagwell leading off the
next inning. I've got (Dennis) Cook warmed up, and he has Bagwell,
(Ken) Caminiti and Carl (Everett), who has been swinging a great
righthanded bat.''
</P>
<P>
   If the decision had been totally up to Powell (4-4), he probably
would have preferred facing Ordonez, who has only one hit in five
career at-bats against the Astros reliever. Franco is now 2-for-2
against Powell, despite the fact Monday's game-winner was no more
than a flare off the end of the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franco's a good hitter,'' Powell said. ``He did his job, and I
can't take anything away from him. With Ordonez up there, the odds
of getting him out are better than with Franco, but at the same
time, I understand Dierker's logic of wanting to get Benitez out of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The National League Central-leading Astros remained a half-game
ahead of Cincinnati, which lost at Atlanta on Monday night. The
Mets trail Atlanta by the same margin in the NL East, but the New
Yorkers have the best record in the majors (50-21) since June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets and the Reds seem to score late in games,'' Astros
shortstop Tim Bogar said. ``They're beating closers and good setup
men. They just keep getting hits when they need them, and it's
contagious. I wish we would catch that bug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros do seem to have caught a case of home-run fever.
After falling behind 2-0 in the first four innings, they tied the
score on a pair of solo homers _ one by Matt Mieske in the fifth
and the other by Everett in the seventh. The Astros have hit nine
home runs in their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's home run was his ninth in 16 games since returning
from the disabled list. He has 27 RBIs during that stretch and is
hitting .422 with an unreal .938 slugging percentage in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The loss overshadowed a strong effort from Astros starter Scott
Elarton, who worked a career-high eight innings, allowing just two
runs on six hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott pitched quite well,'' Dierker said. ``He neutralized a
good lineup, and you don't do that by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets struck first on Edgardo Alfonzo's solo home run to left
field in the first inning, and Roger Cedeno's fourth-inning
sacrifice fly scored Robin Ventura to push the lead to two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros didn't have an abundance of scoring opportunities
against Mets starter Al Leiter, who held them to two runs in seven
innings, but there were a couple of close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio was stranded at third base after leading off the
game with his major-league-leading 50th double. Leiter escaped
another tight spot in the seventh when he intentionally walked
Biggio with two out to load the bases and coaxed an inning-ending
grounder from Lance Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie left fielder also found himself at center stage with
runners on the corners and two out in the ninth inning. He struck
out against Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you leave that many guys on base, it's tough to
win,'' Berkman said. ``I like being in those situations when guys
are on base and you can influence the outcome with one swing of the
bat. I've always been a guy who drove in runs; I just have to learn
to do it here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' winning rally was set up by center fielder Darryl
Hamilton, who reached on a one-out double, moved to third on a fly
ball to left field and scored on Franco's blooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have a prejudiced view,'' Dierker said, ``but they hit
a couple of balls off the end of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, that's all it takes.

GLENDALE RAISING FUNDS FOR PARADE FLOAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOMINIC BERBEO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE -- Glendale politicians weren't able to put a wrinkle
in plans for a partying basset-hound float to represent the city in
the 2000 Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and now the wrinkled pooch
is paying off for parade fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Six local businesses selling basset-theme merchandise to raise
money for next year's float have been running out of the cute
goodies for the past two months, said Tony Dalkas of Conrads
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for the city of Glendale,'' he said. ``It's a
positive theme and could turn into something even bigger than the
float.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise offered includes basset hound T-shirts, mugs,
magnets and place mats. But the most popular item, he said, are
``beanie baby'' basset hounds that have sold like ``hot cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ackerman, vice president of the Glendale Rose Float
Association, said this year's fund-raising effort is proving one of
the best, thanks in part to the popular basset hound theme.
</P>
<P>
   All proceeds will help establish a fund for next year's float
and help pay back some of the $60,000 the city pitched in for this
year's $90,000 float.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said the basset hound theme had drawn a good response
from the public, making additional fund-raising efforts more
successful than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the association set up a booth at the Basset
Hound Club of Southern California's annual picnic and sold out most
of its merchandise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebratory pooch is not without some enemies, with the
City Council in May choosing to tone down the float's party theme
and change the name from ``Party Animal'' to ``Havin' Fun Yet?''
</P>
<P>
   An opponent of the party-hat wearing dog was Marilyne Wiechmann,
who voiced concern the float would inappropriately portray Glendale
as a drinking party town.
</P>
<P>
   She was pitted against Glendale Municipal Court Presiding Judge
James Simpson, who owns ``Deputy Waldo,'' a 3{-year-old basset
hound.
</P>
<P>
   He sent out a light-hearted letter from a ``Wally B. Hound''
that asked ``Why the big fuss over a name? It is a new century.
Glendale is not what it was 50 years ago. Be adventurous. Be
progressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The basset hound prevailed, and the unusual fight has brought
attention that might have helped fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Float activists plan to use that momentum to their advantage
and, Dalkas says, there are rumors a publicity stint is planned in
the form of a fictitious lawsuit claiming ``dog discrimination''
because other breeds weren't chosen for the parade part.
</P>
<P>
   He said a legal defense fund could be formed to raise additional
money for the float.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts don't stop there. A Sept. 18 fund-raiser at
Conrad's will include the auctioning of five seats on the New
Year's Day float, and a basset hound show and contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting on the Hounds'' will include various contests and go
from 3 to 8 p.m., with the auction beginning at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dalkas said more than 200 basset hounds and their owners are
expected to show up and vie for prizes in events such as
synchronized swimming, relay races, a kissing contest, a howling
contest and the ``basset queen with her court.''

   The National Right to Life Committee, once a McCain ally but
more recently a bitter foe, seized on comments made by the Arizona
senator in San Francisco last week that he would not support ``in
the short term, or even the long term'' the repeal of ``Roe vs.
Wade,'' the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the landmark ruling now ``would then force X number of
women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations,''
McCain told a private meeting of the ``San Francisco Chronicle''
editorial board.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, an umbrella group for about 3,000 local
anti-abortion organizations in all 50 states, said in a news
release Monday that the remark was directly contradictory to many
past statements by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The group produced a copy of its 1998 congressional candidate
questionnaire in which McCain had checked ``Yes'' in response to,
``Do you support complete reversal'' of ``Roe vs. Wad''e?
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in a statement released by his campaign, defended his
anti-abortion record and said he favors repealing ``Roe vs. Wade''
in the right environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point that I have consistently made is that a repeal of
``Roe vs. Wade'' must occur, but that it must take place in
conjunction with a sustained effort to reduce the number of
abortions performed in America,'' McCain's statement said. ``If
``Roe vs. Wade'' were repealed tomorrow, it would force thousands
of young women to undergo dangerous and illegal operations.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said Monday that
the senator's position has been consistent because he has long
favored repealing the decision while simultaneously curbing
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been his commitment throughout his congressional
career,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-abortion group's legislative director, Douglas
Johnson, was quoted in the press release saying that McCain ``will
sacrifice any principle in order to curry favor with certain
political elites, in an attempt to further his personal political
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, like front-running Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, has said he would not use a ``litmus test'' to
screen out potential Supreme Court justices who support abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Their positions have angered the party's religious
conservatives. New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith recently bolted the
GOP, saying it had abandoned its principles on abortion and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee was once an ally of McCain,
who has had a 17-year record opposing abortion, partial-birth
abortion and federal funding of abortion. The organization's
political action committee donated to McCain's Senate campaign in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship soured in 1997 when Johnson, the
legislative director, began to criticize McCain in the Catholic
press and in New Hampshire and Iowa, site of early presidential
contests next year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was angry with McCain for voting against a bill that
would have banned Parkinson's disease researchers from using fetal
tissue taken during abortions. But the main reason for his ire was
a provision in McCain's campaign-finance reform bill that was later
shelved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would have subjected the Right to Life Committee
and other interest groups to full disclosure requirements and other
federal campaign-finance rules when they broadcast political
advertisements mentioning members of Congress by name. Johnson said
at the time that the new rules ``would cripple the pro-life
movement'' and stifle political speech.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was behind a series of ads airing in Iowa and New
Hampshire late in 1997 that attacked McCain and his campaign-reform
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Mark Salter, McCain's top aide, told ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic:'' `'I consider Douglas Johnson to be a
thoroughly dishonest man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign aides believe the intensity of Johnson's
latest attack Monday may be related to this recent, stormy history.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said in an interview, ``This is completely aside
from the campaign-finance, free-speech issue. Other candidates who
have flip-flopped on ``Roe vs. Wade,'' we have certainly had the
same reaction.'' &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire often says (and no doubt Sammy Sosa feels the same
way) that he would much prefer to be playing for a team with a
chance to win the pennant, which he isn't, than to be chasing his
own record of 70 home runs, which he is. Still, both he and Sosa,
who hit 66 last season, must be deriving some private pleasure from
the fact that they are once again lighting up the major leagues
with a home run race that may not have quite the electricity of
last year's chase but, statistically speaking, is every bit as
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, Sosa had 51 homers and McGwire 50. At this
rate, both will again exceed Babe Ruth's mark of 60 home runs for a
154-game season and Roger Maris' total of 61 for the modern
162-game season.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards are beginning to look a bit like the four-minute
mile. Once Roger Bannister broke that seemingly impenetrable
barrier in 1954, a lot of runners broke it. But for now, the only
people with a shot at 60 or more homers are the same two who did it
last year. Their nearest pursuer in the National League is
Houston's Jeff Bagwell, with 37 homers through the weekend. In the
American League, Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. had 38. McGwire and
Sosa, like Babe Ruth before them, are plainly in a league of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear is why. The pep pill theory is no longer
available. McGwire, who last year took a controversial supplement
called androstenedione, says he gave it up at the start of the
season. Both men are strong and quick with the bat, but so are
others. A more intriguing explanation, which McGwire does not buy,
is that since he and Sosa are on out-of-contention teams, they can
swing from the heels without worrying about niceties like simply
getting on base.
</P>
<P>
   One other possibility, which we like, is that the competition
between the two _ an athlete's sense of occupying a space shared by
only one other person, and perhaps wanting to claim it for himself
_ has helped elevate them above the pack. They certainly do seem to
respond to one another's heroics. After Sosa hit four home runs on
Thursday and Friday to grab the lead, McGwire answered back with
two against the Mets on Sunday, including a shot that measured a
mere 502 feet only because it hit the scoreboard while still in
full flight. Whatever the reason, it is still a great and special
show.

ANGELS BEAT TIGERS IN BATTLE OF THE BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was giveaway night at Edison Field Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That should come as no surprise _ the Anaheim Angels and Detroit
Tigers have been giving away games all season. Going into the game,
the Tigers were tied with the Kansas City Royals for the worst
record in the majors, and the Angels were only one game better.
</P>
<P>
   So right on cue, the two last-place teams gave 17,145 brave fans
what they should have expected all along _ bad baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Through 7{ innings, appropriately enough, neither team had a
lead. Eventually, the Angels prevailed, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck hit a one-out single in the eighth inning to drive
in the go-ahead run. Garret Anderson began the rally against Doug
Brocail (4-4) with his fourth single of the game. Troy Glaus drew a
one-out walk and Walbeck lined a single to right to drive in
Anderson, who scored for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival (3-2) blanked the Tigers in the final 11/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers pitcher Dave Borkowski wasted no time getting started.
Borkowski committed three errors _ all in the first two innings _
to tie a Tigers club record. The errors led to three unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski's problems started when Angels leadoff hitter Trent
Durrington began the first inning with a comebacker that Borkowski
couldn't handle _ error No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski then threw the ball away on a pickoff attempt,
allowing Durrington to take second _ error No. 2. Durrington came
around to score in the first inning on Mo Vaughn's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, the Angels had runners on first and second
with nobody out, but Troy Glaus hit a one-hopper back to Borkowski,
setting up a certain double play.
</P>
<P>
   Only Borkowski's throw to second sailed wide of the bag and into
center field, allowing Anderson to score from second _ error No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds' RBI double in the fourth inning gave starter Tim
Belcher and the Angels a 4-1 lead, but in the sixth the Angels
began giving back the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Dodger Karim Garcia hit an opposite-field home run to left
field, his eighth of the season, driving in ex-Angel Damion Easley
in ahead of him to cut the Angels' lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels responded in their half of the sixth after Tim
Salmon's leadoff triple. It was Salmon's first triple in more than
a year. His last triple was Aug. 5, 1998 at home against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson followed with his third hit of the night, a single to
right field for a 5-3 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings,
was in line to get his first victory in more than two months. His
previous victory came in a 4-2 win over the Yankees June 20 in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But Angels reliever Lou Pote entered the seventh and failed to
retire anyone. He walked the first two batters he faced, then
allowed an RBI double to Tony Clark before getting the hook. Juan
Encarnaicion's RBI groundout off Mike Magnante _ the run charged to
Pote _ tied the game at 5.

RELEASE OF ARIZONA EDUCATIONAL TEST SCORES IS OPPOSED

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The president of the state Board of Education isn't so
sure she wants the public to see the first round of scores for
Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Results of AIMS will be released in October to today's high
school juniors, 60,000 of whom took the reading, writing and math
exam last spring. But Mary Garcia voiced concerns during the
board's Monday meeting about announcing to everyone how many
students conquered the state's academic standards and how many
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Move slowly, she cautioned, AIMS is still in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is how we treat the results,'' Garcia said. ``We
didn't give the test to get high-stakes feedback. We did it more to
inform us.''
</P>
<P>
   She called releasing school, district and state test-result
trends an unnecessary reaction ``to something before we're ready to
hit it head on.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel it's the public's right to know,'' said Holly
Craw, who provides home schooling for two daughters embarking on
their senior year. Craw was one of 15 who took a mock version of
AIMS administered by ``The Arizona'' ``Republic'' last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much hype about the AIMS test,'' said the
north Phoenix mother, whose daughters don't have to take it but has
been following the exam's life. ``So let's see it. This will give
us a base line.''
</P>
<P>
   Although results will appear in juniors' transcripts, educators
and parents alike have questioned how much motivation the first
batch of pupils had to do well on AIMS. &UR; The test won't be a
graduation requirement until today's sophomores _ the Class of 2002
_ take it next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, those students who didn't meet the standards will be
retaking the test in the spring. The exam includes concepts that
the students likely will learn later in their high school career.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Monday's discussion, Garcia said the board would
address whether to make the results public _ and possibly take a
vote _ during its next meeting in September.
</P>
<P>
   However, state Department of Education officials, who had been
poised to release AIMS results to the masses, have their own
concerns. Department number crunchers want to analyze and compare
the results. But that might conflict with a decision to keep the
test scores under wraps, because any such analysis likely would
have to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction,
is in favor of making the data public. She was out of town and not
privy to Monday's conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we really want to get the most out of the test, then we
want to pull together the numbers to see how schools did and how
districts did,'' said Patty Likens, an Education Department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   AIMS, crafted to ensure that Arizona students are grasping the
state's academic standards, has spent much time in the news. For
awhile, parents and educators worried that the test was debuting
before students had adequate time to digest the standards,
especially those revolving around math. In the end, the Board of
Education decided to wait until the Class of 2002 to tie AIMS to a
high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   They also feared that Spanish-speaking and special-needs
children would have difficulty on the exam. The test remains in the
shadow of a 7-year-old lawsuit that claims it's discriminatory
against limited-English students and that the state doesn't do
enough to bridge the language gap in education.
</P>
<P>
   State educators are moving forward with AIMS, nonetheless. In
April, the Board of Education approved an outline of how to gauge
students' performance on the test.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's meeting, the board picked a common number, 500,
that will be used as the cutoff score to determine who meets the
standards in reading, writing and math. It also decided to ask a
group of educators who helped define the cutoff score descriptions
in math to meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was the board's discussion about whether to make the
first round of scores public that seemed to spark the most debate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tom Haladyna, a professor and testing expert at Arizona
State University West, has been critical of AIMS, he does
understand why Garcia of the state board is hesitant about
releasing scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go carefully and make sure the test is really good,'' he said,
adding that comparing students' test scores isn't necessarily the
best thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Kotterman, president of the Arizona Education Association,
agreed, saying that it's not fair to put undue pressure on students
and worry parents before the wrinkles of the exam are ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   Providing AIMS scores to each student and teacher will help
improve the test, pointing out strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they (Board of Education) decide to do, they need to
be cautious,'' Kotterman said. &QL;

BENNETT WINS UCLA DERBY EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bad plays decided UCLA's preseason quarterback
competition earlier than expected. Junior Drew Bennett avoided them
better than everyone else, and for that reason he'll start the
season opener Sept. 4 against Boise State in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tentative plan is to go the first two games, and possibly
three, with the two guys and maybe a third (Scott McEwan)
playing,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``At that time, I'd like to
make a decision on one. But we'll have two ready to play if one
struggles or gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   As planned, Toledo announced the quarterback cuts Monday
morning, with Bennett and redshirt freshman Cory Paus surviving.
(Thousand Oaks native McEwan is third string and Agoura High's Ryan
McCann is fourth.) However, no one expected Toledo to name a
starter this early. Even Bennett, the front-runner, was prepared to
compete for two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would be one of the two battling it out,'' Bennett
said. ``But when he said I would be starting against Boise State, I
was shocked. It was like, `Wow, all right.'... I called my parents
and told them they have to make it to at least one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo didn't stop at the starter. He named Paus the backup and
proffered a basic plan for using Bennett and Paus in the opening
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what we're going to do yet, whether (Paus will
play) two series, three series, first quarter or second quarter,''
Toledo said. ``But both guys will play when the game's in doubt...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking not just at the nonleague (games), but at the
league and the future. The guy that does it will be the quarterback
of the future. That's a big investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice plan reflected it. Toledo and offensive coordinator
Al Borges split repetitions equally among the four candidates. They
tracked every pass thrown in one-on-one drills and scrimmages. They
analyzed statistics and took input from their assistants. In the
end, the answer was fairly obvious:
</P>
<P>
   Although Paus had a higher completion percentage, he could not
overcome Bennett's two-year edge in experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves to be the starter,'' Paus said. ``For me, this is
just the next step on the ladder. I've made the next jump: I get to
play in the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has a better grasp of the offense than Paus. He knows
which plays work against specific defenses and, more importantly,
which plays won't work. That enables him to audible (change the
play) efficiently at the line of scrimmage _ a crucial component to
UCLA's dynamic attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew didn't let us run bad plays, and he got us out of bad
plays and into good plays,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   McEwan and McCann were disappointed but not surprised by the
decision. As a redshirt sophomore, McEwan now faces an eligibility
bind. He has three years remaining after this season, so if he
wants to transfer, this is the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely sticking around,'' he said. ``I'm two injuries
away from playing, but I'm not hoping that happens. Transfers are
for guys who don't feel they're good enough to stick with the
program. And I love it here. I live 30 minutes away.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann, a redshirt freshman who suffered a concussion in
Saturday's scrimmage, said he has no plans to transfer and repeated
the Cade McNown story: McNown was the No. 4 quarterback when
training camp began in 1995, then became the starter six weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get back from this injury and start working
hard,'' McCann said. ``You never know what's going to happen.''

`REPUBLIC' COLUMNIST'S DISMISSAL A STORY OF UNTRACEABLE SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID PARRISH, MICHAEL MURPHY  and MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For five years, Julie Amparano was one of the most
respected writers at ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   When she became the paper's Life section columnist in July, she
quickly wrote a string of poignant and compelling true-life stories
about people in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   There was the White racist who at 25 discovered he was half
Hispanic. The gay man living in an intolerant neighborhood. The
upscale woman visiting the downscale restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, Amparano was fired last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a front page note to its readers on Saturday, ``The
Republic'' revealed that some of the people quoted in Amparano's
column were untraceable.
</P>
<P>
   During two days of searching last week, ``Republic'' editors
reviewed 11 out of 17 of Amparano's thrice-weekly columns she wrote
since July. A total of 65 people were identified in the columns.
The editors had questions on about 40 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 24 had uncommon names and were checked out. Four were
found.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the people named in the columns couldn't be traced,
including the former racist, the gay man and the upscale diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel embarrassed and chagrined about this,'' Deputy Managing
Editor John D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth could these columns have gotten into the paper?''
Senior Features Editor Susan Felt asked herself.
</P>
<P>
   Felt oversees the paper's Life section, and D'Anna is her
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano, 39, denied that some of the people in her column were
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there; I went to different places of the town,
looking for people from different walks of life, and they're
real,'' Amparano said Monday morning while being interviewed on
KTAR-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're saying that I should have seen the driver's license
. . . well, that changes the rules of the game. But I did what I
was told to do. I was told to be a fly on the wall, get
conversations, bring them into the paper, and that's what I've
done,'' Amparano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken people's names down, what they told me they did,
and put them in the pages of `The Republic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has just been very unfair, very unfair to my name
and credibility, and I'm out to prove it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano later issued a statement saying she was given
inadequate time, less than 24 hours, to produce the requested
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the demand was unfair from the onset,'' she
said. ``Nonetheless, all of my sources were credible and real
individuals with firsthand knowledge about the subjects they
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   While being questioned by editors last week, Amparano
steadfastly denied any fabrication of people or events,
``Republic'' Managing Editor Julia Wallace and D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people quoted in her column, she told the editors,
were found while she was out in the community _ at parks,
bookstores or on street corners _ and could not be readily traced.
</P>
<P>
   D'Anna said he now views in a different light Amparano's
stories, which were filled with insightful quotes from everyday
people and powerful tales of injustice and racism in the Phoenix
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read things that were too good to be true,'' said D'Anna,
a friend of Amparano's for nearly 20 years. ``In hindsight, the
fact we were getting something that was so new and different and
fit so well into our goals, yeah, it clouded my judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations leveled against Amparano also raised concerns at
``The Republic'' about how well editors and reporters adhere to
journalistic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who joined the ``Republic'' last December, said the
newspaper's staff needs to have a long conversation about ethics,
standards and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we do not have enough safeguards in place to
prevent something like this from happening,'' Wallace said. ``Every
time something like this happens, it eats away at what we all
do.'' &QL; 
MEDIA EMBARRASSMENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amparano's firing is the latest in a string of embarrassments
for the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ``Boston Globe'' columnist Patricia Smith was fired
for making up people and quotes, and another ``Globe'' columnist,
Mike Barnicle, resigned under suspicion that he had fabricated a
column about two children hospitalized with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Republic'' magazine writer Stephen Glass was fired because
of allegations that his articles contained 47 fabrications. The
``Cincinnati Enquirer'' fired a reporter who used stolen voice mail
to create what the paper later called ``untrue'' stories about
Chiquita Brands International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Arizona Republic,'' the accusations against Amparano
represent perhaps the biggest public embarrassment since publisher
Darrow ``Duke'' Tully was forced to resign in 1985 after it was
disclosed that his 30-year military career was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Deni Elliott, director of the practical ethics center at the
University of Montana, said the news industry is largely to blame
for fabrications because of what gets rewarded and noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pressure in every newsroom to find the right quote,
to create stories, columns that fit together in a way that is
aesthetically pleasing,'' said Elliott, who has been a reporter and
ethics coach at the ``Philadelphia Enquirer.''``'' &QL; 
REASSESSED SYSTEMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after Glass and Smith were fired by their
publications, ``Republic'' Reader Advocate Richard de Uriarte wrote
that the paper was reassessing its internal systems of
fact-checking and editorial review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we let some things slide into the newspaper, perhaps
because the writing was so compelling, so entertaining, that it
just had to be shared?'' de Uriarte asked in his 1998 column.
</P>
<P>
   After Wallace joined the paper last December, she started a
credibility committee. Reporters and editors have so far reviewed
the paper's corrections policy and discussed issues such as
stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   De Uriarte said the committee has been developing feedback
surveys that will be sent randomly to people quoted in the paper,
asking whether they were quoted correctly and whether the story was
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to get it started this summer,'' de Uriarte said,
``but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With any safeguard system, editors still have to trust reporters
to act professionally, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's practical for editors to re-report and
fact-check every story,'' he said. ``Editors do, however, have an
incredible responsibility to make sure _ and this is for the
reporter's protection, too _ that the facts are there as they
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano had been one of ``The Republic's'' stars. Editors raved
about her work _ the ability to tell human stories through the eyes
of everyday people. Being Hispanic made her success all the more
sweet for the newspaper as it tried to appeal to more of the area's
growing Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was getting such good stuff,'' Wallace said. ``She was
really connecting with people, especially in the minority
community.'' &QL; 
A SOLID CAREER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining ``The Republic'' five years ago, Amparano had
put together a solid journalism career, including working at the
Associated Press, the ``Philadelphia Daily News'' and the ``Wall
Street Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano is Region 7 director of the National Association of
Hispanic Journalists _ an organization with 1,700 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street Journal'' editor Roger Rickless supervised
Amparano _ then Julie Amparano Lopez _ when she wrote on management
and workplace issues from the paper's New York bureau in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly were no ethical issues (that) arose during
that time,'' said Rickless, now Canada editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schiffman, who edited Amparano's stories when she worked
for the Associated Press's San Francisco bureau in the mid-1980s,
said he didn't recall any questions being raised about her work.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is Amparano's hometown, and she returned to be closer to
her family, D'Anna said. &QL; 
COWORKERS REACT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A popular and engaging person, Amparano's dismissal was greeted
by editors and reporters with a mixture of shock, disbelief and
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed because I had high hopes for her
column and future work,'' said Pam Johnson, executive editor and
vice president for news at ``The Republic.'' ``What a
disappointment to the newspaper and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Graciela Sevilla said she hasn't seen any proof that
convinces her that Amparano made up people in her columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known and worked with her for five years, and I can't
think of another reporter I know who has higher ethical standards
than Julie. So this seems incredibly far-fetched to me,'' Sevilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Amparano is involved in local and national journalism
organizations, and has frequently talked to younger reporters about
the importance of journalistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that she's a very capable and talented
journalist. So I don't see why she would have a need to do
something like this,'' Sevilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Richard Ruelas, who belongs to two Hispanic
journalists' organizations with Amparano, wasn't sure what to make
of the paper's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're completely out of character to the person I know _ In
my dealings with her, she was always professional and
hard-working,'' Ruelas said. ``I would like to think the paper I
work for did the right thing.'' &QL; 
``Republic'' photographer Paul F. Gero said he was shocked by
Amparano's firing: ``I've always known Julie to be a total
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Jodie Snyder said that in working with Amparano on at
least one story she had ``small doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the quotes did sound too good to be true.`` &QL; 
CONCERNS SPUR INQUIRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' editors began investigating Aug. 16 when a senior
newsroom staff member reported that there were rumors that Amparano
was making up some parts of her column. Reporters for other media
were possibly working on a story about it, the editors were told.
</P>
<P>
   The editors had their doubts, but decided to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I was still a believer (in Amparano),'' Wallace
said. ``I know there were a lot of people who were jealous that
Julie got the column. Maybe it was a smear job.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday afternoon, Wallace called Senior Editor David
Fritze to a private conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me her columns and pointed out that `Jennifer
Morgan' had appeared twice this year and a couple of times in (her)
stories several years ago,'' Fritze said. ``I was told to take
these columns and locate these people and see if they existed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fritze was metro editor, Amparano had been one of his
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired her and thought she had a lot of talent,'' Fritze
said. ``I had not seen anything in her columns to give me any
indications to question the integrity of her reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   That would quickly change.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he went through the columns and divided the names
into two groups.
</P>
<P>
   He bypassed investigating the first group, family members and
persons fully identicied by their organizations, reasoning that no
one would attempt to fabricate such people.
</P>
<P>
   The second list was of people who were identified only by a name
in the columns or with a vague job description.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Morgan _ both of them _ made the second list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to locate about 20 people,'' Fritze said.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he used phone books, operator directory assistance
and online services such as CDB Infoteck and AutoTrack that people
can be traced through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, worst case scenario, I run across some names
we can't track, but we find most people,'' Fritze said. ``As I went
along, I was stunned. I'd run name after name without getting any
hits.'' &QL; 
MISSING PERSONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because private investigators have broader access to state
government data, ``The Republic'' hired Scott Yeager of Faxon
Investigations to check 15 names through Motor Vehicle Department
records and voter registration files.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the investigations proved inconclusive. For example,
there were 31 other possible matches found for the name Susan Hall
_ identified in Amparano's Aug. 9 column as the down-and-out mother
of the 5-year-old boy who goes hungry every day.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he didn't have enough time to track down each of
those 32 Susan Halls, or other common names with multiple matches.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 15 names submitted to the private investigator, no
matches were found for 11 of them, ``Republic'' records show.
</P>
<P>
   That included Luis Adler Varela, the White racist who discovered
he was Hispanic, and Gus McDougal the gay man who was being
harassed by intolerant neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts also were raised about some names with numerous matches,
Fritze said.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano's July 19 column quoted a Jennifer Morgan, identified
only as someone outraged by the increased bombardment of commercial
advertisements at her dentist's office.
</P>
<P>
   Then in an Aug. 11 column, Amparano quoted a Jennifer Morgan,
identified as an attorney. The Arizona Bar Association lists no
such member.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in 1995, Amparano quoted in news stories individuals named
Jennifer Morgan. One was identified as an owner of a telephone
answering service, and another Jennifer Morgan was listed as an
advertising representative from Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' editors said Amparano could not provide them with
any way to contact any of the four different Jennifer Morgans.
</P>
<P>
   Editors said their doubts grew about the Aug. 9 column featuring
the hungry 5-year-old boy after reviewing a series of e-mail
messages that Amparano sent to readers inquiring how they could
help the family.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano said she could not locate the boy's mother, Susan Hall,
after the column ran, Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   To readers, Amparano gave conflicting responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family received tons of assistance. But if you still like
to help others, please call the Thomas Pappas Elementary School for
homeless children,'' Amparano e-mailed one reader on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 minutes after the first message, however, Amparano sent
this e-mail to another reader: ``The community outpour (sic) has
been overwhelming. I am trying to get a hold of Susan Hall, her
phone has been disconnected. I will let you know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano's e-mails were acquired as part of ``The Republic's''
internal investigation. &QL; 
OTHER QUESTIONS &QL; 
D'Anna said other questions surfaced while questioning Amparano.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano did not know the location of Crossroads Park in Gilbert
where she said she found and interviewed the gay man, Gus McDougal.
She told editors that she did nothing to verify that the man was
who he said he was, including getting his home address or phone
number, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave vague and varied answers on a Patricia Anderson, who
was identified in a column as a banker, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   The editors said they were told by Amparano that the interview
with Anderson took place at Bank One Plaza in downtown Phoenix.
When told no such person worked at Bank One, Amparano said that she
might have been mistaken and that Anderson could work for another
bank, D'Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano could provide no phone number or address for Anderson,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republic'' editors said they had several meetings last week
with Amparano, during which she was asked to prove phone numbers
and other details.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano did turn over some phone numbers, such as those
belonging to women quoted in a column about a Girl Scout trip that
Amparano and her daughter attended.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano also produced a phone number for Luis Adler Varela, the
White racist who belatedly discovered he was half Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Fritze said he called the number several times, and finally a
woman answered who said she didn't know a Luis Adler Varela.
Further checking showed that the phone was listed to Amparano's
niece, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, Amparano met again with ``Republic''
management to go over the columns. D'Anna said she still could not
provide evidence that many of the people existed.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano asked for the weekend to locate people.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said she was inclined to grant that request. But as the
questioning proceeded, Wallace mentioned the niece's name and asked
Amparano whether she knew that person.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano hesitated, then denied she knew such a person, Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she is telling us her niece is not her niece, what's the
point? You can't believe anything she's saying,'' Wallace said. ``I
said `Julie, you're fired.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace gave three reasons for the firing: irresponsible
reporting; contradictory statements to editors during the
investigation; and inability to substantiate multiple people in her
column.
</P>
<P>
   Amparano said through her attorney, Stephen Montoya, that she
stands by all her stories. &QL;

ANTI-ABORTION GROUP ACCUSES MCCAIN OF FLIP-FLOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the nation's largest anti-abortion groups
accused GOP presidential candidate John McCain on Monday of
executing ``a drastic flip-flop'' on legal abortion that it said
``demonstrates that McCain will sacrifice any principle'' for
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, once a McCain ally but
more recently a bitter foe, seized on comments made by the Arizona
senator in San Francisco last week that he would not support ``in
the short term, or even the long term'' the repeal of ``Roe vs.
Wade,'' the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the landmark ruling now ``would then force X number of
women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations,''
McCain told a private meeting of the ``San Francisco Chronicle''
editorial board.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, an umbrella group for about 3,000 local
anti-abortion organizations in all 50 states, said in a news
release Monday that the remark was directly contradictory to many
past statements by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The group produced a copy of its 1998 congressional candidate
questionnaire in which McCain had checked ``Yes'' in response to,
``Do you support complete reversal'' of ``Roe vs. Wad''e?
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in a statement released by his campaign, defended his
anti-abortion record and said he favors repealing ``Roe vs. Wade''
in the right environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point that I have consistently made is that a repeal of
``Roe vs. Wade'' must occur, but that it must take place in
conjunction with a sustained effort to reduce the number of
abortions performed in America,'' McCain's statement said. ``If
``Roe vs. Wade'' were repealed tomorrow, it would force thousands
of young women to undergo dangerous and illegal operations.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said Monday that
the senator's position has been consistent because he has long
favored repealing the decision while simultaneously curbing
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been his commitment throughout his congressional
career,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-abortion group's legislative director, Douglas
Johnson, was quoted in the press release saying that McCain ``will
sacrifice any principle in order to curry favor with certain
political elites, in an attempt to further his personal political
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, like front-running Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, has said he would not use a ``litmus test'' to
screen out potential Supreme Court justices who support abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Their positions have angered the party's religious
conservatives. New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith recently bolted the
GOP, saying it had abandoned its principles on abortion and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee was once an ally of McCain,
who has had a 17-year record opposing abortion, partial-birth
abortion and federal funding of abortion. The organization's
political action committee donated to McCain's Senate campaign in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship soured in 1997 when Johnson, the
legislative director, began to criticize McCain in the Catholic
press and in New Hampshire and Iowa, site of early presidential
contests next year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was angry with McCain for voting against a bill that
would have banned Parkinson's disease researchers from using fetal
tissue taken during abortions. But the main reason for his ire was
a provision in McCain's campaign-finance reform bill that was later
shelved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would have subjected the Right to Life Committee
and other interest groups to full disclosure requirements and other
federal campaign-finance rules when they broadcast political
advertisements mentioning members of Congress by name. Johnson said
at the time that the new rules ``would cripple the pro-life
movement'' and stifle political speech.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was behind a series of ads airing in Iowa and New
Hampshire late in 1997 that attacked McCain and his campaign-reform
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Mark Salter, McCain's top aide, told ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic:'' `'I consider Douglas Johnson to be a
thoroughly dishonest man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign aides believe the intensity of Johnson's
latest attack Monday may be related to this recent, stormy history.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said in an interview, ``This is completely aside
from the campaign-finance, free-speech issue. Other candidates who
have flip-flopped on ``Roe vs. Wade,'' we have certainly had the
same reaction.'' &QL;

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL;

HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAYS OF INFAMY &QL; 
By Michael Coffey  &QL; 
(Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

RED SOX BEAT TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-TWINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The long ball has been missing lately from the Red
Sox' arsenal. So has the so-called quality start. Pity. Life can be
such fun for the members of the Olde Towne Team when they remember
how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Monday night in a 4-1 victory over the
Minnesota Twins before 14,331 at the Metrodome. The game was
decided by bombs off the bats of outfielders Trot Nixon and Troy
O'Leary, as Boston ended a four-game losing streak. With Pat Rapp
working six innings, followed by three more from closer Derek Lowe,
you wonder why the Red Sox can't do this every night.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's drive in the second inning gave the Red Sox a 2-0 lead.
After Minnesota pushed across a run in the third, O'Leary came
through in the fifth inning with another two-run shot, his 25th
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston moved back into a tie with Oakland in the American League
wild-card chase. The teams have identical 68-57 records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to help the team win ballgames,'' said Nixon,
the No. 9 hitter most nights. ``Most times, I just want to get on
base for the top of the lineup. The home run is just a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is crunch time _ the last part of this month and
September. I feel like I need to hit the ball, too, so there is no
weak link in our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary felt the same way. The three-game sweep by the Texas
Rangers over the weekend had left a bitter taste in his mouth. The
Sox had an early-morning arrival in the Twin Cities. Their charter
plane from Dallas Sunday night had a flat tire and was delayed four
hours. The players arrived in their downtown hotel late enough to
read the morning papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trot picked us up with his home run,'' said O'Leary. ``It made
everybody relaxed out there. Things started going for us. I don't
even know what to call it. I don't care what I do as long as we
came up with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four losses, the Red Sox had hit only two home runs. On
Sunday, they were shut out by former Sox righthander Aaron Sele,
6-0. Monday night, the offense put together 10 hits, including two
each by O'Leary, Jose Offerman, and Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp played a key role, even though he had runners on base in
each of the six innings he worked. His concentration was admirable
considering that his pregnant wife is having troubles some two
months before the baby is due.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp struck out six and walked three. Lowe registered his
seventh save with three innings of two-hit, five-strikeout work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be out there, do my job,'' said Rapp. ``Keep
us in the game and give our bats a chance to come alive. I couldn't
get my curveball over early, and it got me into a couple of jams.
Once I got the guys on, I made the right pitches to get us out of
the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said he will stay with the club at least until it returns
to Boston and then decide what to do. ``Things really haven't
changed at home with my wife,'' he said. ``Her blood pressure has
stabilized more or less, but they still want her in the bed on her
back. It's tough with two boys in the house running around. The
baby will come sooner than later. But she's fighting through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams said Rapp and his teammates did well
Monday night. ``Overall, we pitched and played a clean game out
there,'' said Williams. ``That was important. Don't forget that
Rapp was with us in Texas and on that deluxe flight. He was the key
because he got us through the sixth inning. Lowe had plenty of time
off. You knew he was rested from the standpoint of giving you more
than 1-2 innings. Fortunately, it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lowe, ``I know the long layover affected me. I didn't feel
good but I told myself, `One pitch at a time.' I made it through it
and Pat got a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of strikeouts but there were balls out of the
zone. I don't try to strike people out. I try to get hit the ball
on the ground every time.''

ANGELS BEAT TIGERS IN BATTLE OF THE BAD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was giveaway night at Edison Field on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But that should come as no surprise _ the Anaheim Angels and
Detroit Tigers have been giving away games all season. Going into
the game, the Tigers were tied with the Kansas City Royals for the
worst record in the majors, and the Angels were only one game
better.
</P>
<P>
   So right on cue, the two last-place teams gave 17,145 brave fans
what they should have expected all along: bad baseball.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the rules say there are no ties in baseball,
somebody had to win. Matt Walbeck's RBI single to right field with
one out in the eighth inning scored Garret Anderson with the
winning run in a 6-5 Angels victory.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, neither team won the series. The Tigers
and Angels split the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Angels closer Troy Percival (3-2) pitched 11/3 innings to get
the win over Tigers reliever Doug Brocail (4-4). Anderson had four
hits to match a season high accomplished three other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we got a base hit with a runner in scoring
position,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of Walbeck's
game-winner. ``Matty got a ball that found a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to be in that situation,'' said Walbeck, who
has lost significant playing time since the call-up of Ben Molina.
``I was trying to hit the ball to right-center and I got just
enough wood on the ball and hit it exactly where I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigers pitcher Dave Borkowski wasted no time getting into a
giving mood. Borkowski committed three errors _ in the first two
innings _ to tie a Tigers club record. The errors led to three
unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski's problems started when Angels leadoff hitter Trent
Durrington began the first inning with a comebacker that Borkowski
couldn't handle (error No. 1).
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski then threw the ball away on a pickoff attempt,
allowing Durrington to take second (error No. 2). Durrington came
around to score on Mo Vaughn's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, the Angels had runners on first and second
with nobody out, but Troy Glaus hit a one-hopper back to Borkowski,
setting up a certain double play.
</P>
<P>
   Only Borkowski's throw to second sailed wide of the bag and into
center field, allowing Anderson to score from second (error No. 3).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds' RBI double in the fourth inning gave starter Tim
Belcher and the Angels a 4-1 lead, but in the sixth the Angels
began giving back the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Dodger Karim Garcia hit an opposite-field home run to left
field, his eighth of the season, driving in ex-Angel Damion Easley
in ahead of him to cut the Angels' lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels responded in their half of the sixth after Tim
Salmon's leadoff triple. It was Salmon's first triple since Aug. 5,
1998 at home against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson followed with his third single, a grounder to right for
a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Angels reliever Lou Pote entered the seventh and failed to
retire anyone. He walked the first two batters he faced, then
allowed an RBI double to Tony Clark before getting the hook. Juan
Encarnaicion's RBI groundout off Mike Magnante tied the game at 5.

TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH AS MARINERS TRY TO THWART DECAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What's the most hackneyed expression in sports that
describes an aging athlete?
</P>
<P>
   He's lost a step.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't apply to Lou Piniella. In fact, just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner manager, before the ESPN nation Sunday night, found
a step.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the step was at the top of the dugout. In failing
to clear it as he charged onto the field to protest a call,
Piniella launched himself into a stumbling faceplant that was so
rich in seasonal metaphor that space does not permit a full
recitation.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Piniella executed a full '99 Mariner: A
futile plan made worse by faulty execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time I've ever done that,'' he said Monday, chuckling at
himself. ``I just don't have the first-step explosion any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to laugh at himself has always been one of
Piniella's endearing traits. But Sunday, as he bounced up from the
dirt and engaged in a fiery tantrum that drew his fourth ejection
in less than a month, Piniella seemed to drift across a line that
separates laughing with him to laughing at him.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was absolutely right in his argument _ if the
Indians' Carlos Baerga had slid any further outside the baseline,
he would have been hit by the trains just beyond right field _
Piniella's histrionics were so overwrought, and so familiar, that
it evoked only the weak courtesy laugh offered for a fading
nightclub comedian.
</P>
<P>
   After a placid half-season, Piniella was booted from games on
July 25, Aug. 8 and Aug. 14 as well as Sunday. At this rate,
Piniella by Labor Day will be a tattoo and two nose rings short of
the Rodman threshold of terminal foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, in the (four disputed calls), except for one, the film
proved I was dead right,'' he said. ``Sure, you can say I should go
out and argue and handle it. But I'm not doing this for me, I'm
doing it for the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the ballclub. That's the one that has had two brawls in the
last five weeks. The fights resulted in injuries and suspensions
for which the Mariners are still paying.
</P>
<P>
   No suggestion will be made here for some dignity and decorum.
This is, after all, baseball, where a public scratch of the groin
is considered an inalienable right.
</P>
<P>
   But an observer of national TV highlights recently cannot escape
the conclusion that the Mariners, despite Monday night's 4-1 win
over Cleveland that thwarted a four-game sweep, are little more
than higher-paid rasslers more skilled at pile drivers than driving
in runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the chair-breaking has happened since the team
moved to the Guilty Pleasure from the Kingdome. As much as the park
has been a delight for fans _ as long as they don't have need of a
parking space, safe food or a clean bathroom _ it seems that team
tensions have been ratcheted up significantly.
</P>
<P>
   What it has produced is men behaving badly.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to quantify, but it's also hard to miss _ this team is
nowhere as good as its yard, nor deserving of nightly sellouts. The
players, as well as Piniella, are embarrassed by what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   As Alex Rodriguez put it after the Sunday loss, ``We suck.''
</P>
<P>
   An inelegant description, yes, but apt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't deny that it's been tough, what we've been going
through,'' Piniella said. ``We're going with seven rookie pitchers
(five actually, but Todd Williams and Jose Paniagua have limited
major league experience), and we've moved from a smaller park to a
bigger park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, we had to play in a new park to see what we
needed, instead of thinking we knew what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella has always been a win-now guy, from his playing days as
well as his first managerial job with the Yankees. But the Yankees'
financial clout makes them a win-now team by definition.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, for last season and this one, are not a win-now
team, having sunk to the bottom half of the major league payroll
ladder. For a variety of reasons already well-chronicled, the
Mariners are in decay and Piniella has been forced to play for the
future, not the present.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he arrived, Piniella's expansive
in-season conversations are almost exclusively about what's ahead,
not what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching-wise, we're in a lot better shape than we've been for
many years,'' he said. ``If we can get a couple more key guys, we
can put together a staff that will be around awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   If ... if ... if ... this kind of talk must be eating him. But
he has been a stoic keeper of the team faith. He has a team in
transition ill-suited for its new surroundings, yet he can't
complain or lament without jeopardizing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoulder it, rightfully so,'' he said. ``I can take the
heat. Always have. I'm no different a manager now than when we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true. But when he is losing while 45,000 fans a
night _ as well as Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. _ are staring
impatiently, the heat is unusually intense, with no reasonable
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an umpire makes a bad call, or an opposing pitcher hits a
Mariner. Then, these guys swing with anyone.

CONTRACT TALKS WITH GALLOWAY GET TESTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ The Seahawks' contract talks with leading
receiver Joey Galloway have become a test of wills.
</P>
<P>
   And both sides are getting a bit testy as Galloway's holdout
enters its 26th day Tuesday, with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The club has drawn a line on the negotiating table, tweaking its
seven-year, $35 million offer by moving almost $1 million from the
final two years of the deal into the first five years, and adopting
a take-it-or-leave it stance.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway and his agent, Eric Metz, consider the new $4.6 million
average over the first five years and the club's offer of a $7
million signing bonus to be below market value.
</P>
<P>
   For this deal to get done, something _ or someone _ will have to
give.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're new like we are, it was bound to happen with
somebody,'' said Holmgren, who was hired as general manager and
coach in January and then hired Mike Reinfelt to be his chief
contract negotiator. ``I have to establish how we're going to do
business. We're going to be fair. If I say something, that's the
way it's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey is under contract. He should be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Galloway not at the team's Eastern Washington
University training camp, but talks have broken off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to get hold of Joey's agent ... we've phoned
every day,'' Holmgren said. ``He won't return our calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of that comment Monday, Metz offered, ``Haven't they made
their final offer? What is there to talk about?''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Galloway say he is prepared to sit out the
entire preseason and even miss some regular-season paychecks rather
than accept a deal he deems less than fair.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway has a year remaining on the five-year deal he signed in
1995 after being the team's first-round draft choice. But he
accepted the fifth year, at a reduced salary of $1.585 million,
with the understanding a new deal would be done before it ever
reached this point. That deal, however, was signed when Ken Behring
owned the team and Mickey Loomis was the primary contract
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren called Galloway over the weekend and Monday discussed
his reason for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things get lost in the interruption when you've got
five people kind of doing it,'' Holmgren said. ``When I talked to
him, I just wanted to make sure he knew what we, as an
organization, were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Listen, we want you here. But this is our offer. It's
a fair offer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway and Metz obviously don't agree, pointing to recent
contracts signed by Green Bay wide receiver Antonio Freeman and New
England cornerback Ty Law.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman got a $5 million average over five years and a $10
million signing bonus as part of his seven-year deal that will void
to five years. Law got a $14 million signing bonus as part of a
seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals have Galloway and Metz expecting a signing bonus
that averages $2 million over the length of the contract and, at
the very least, incentive clauses that could bring the average of
Galloway's deal in line with Freeman's contract.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, incentive clauses have not even been discussed,
and the Seahawks have told Metz they will not include voidable
years in any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this: what we're trying to do with Joey _ and what I
will try and do with every player on this football team _ is be
fair,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness is the one thing Galloway is after. He doesn't consider
the Seahawks' offer to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's their final offer, we can't control that,'' Metz
said. ``If they're trying to portray it as fair, we feel that's
wrong.''

MARINERS' ABBOTT SHOWS HIS OLD TEAM SOME NEW TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Four teams and six years ago, Paul Abbott made five
forgettable starts for the Cleveland Indians. He walked more than
he struck out, allowed more than a hit an inning and was not
brought back the next season.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude was worse than his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how different I am?'' Abbott said Monday night, after
spinning eight shutout innings in the Mariners' 4-1 win over
Cleveland. ``Before games, I was the first guy to look outside for
clouds, because that meant it might rain and we wouldn't have to
run. Now, I cry if I can't run. When I was in a game back then, it
was a job. I love to pitch now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a love made stronger by so many heartaches. Abbott was 25
when he pitched for Cleveland, up from Class AA, uncomfortable with
his delivery and his routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for negative things to happen,'' said Abbott,
who didn't have to wait long.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched in five Class AAA towns after the Indians sent him
down, injuring his shoulder, his elbow and, last winter, his knee.
He did not re-surface in the majors for five years after his
Cleveland stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ever saw him like this,'' said Indians
manager Mike Hargrove. ``We probably wouldn't have let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott (5-0) was masterful Monday, mixing a low-90s fastball
with a devastating tailing changeup to strike out 12 batters, the
most by a Mariner since Randy Johnson's last start in '98. He
allowed only three hits, two to Einar Diaz and an infield single to
Roberto Alomar. No runners advanced past second off him.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Mariners from being swept by the Indians in
this four-game series. Seattle got all the offense it needed in the
first inning, when Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 39th homer and Alex
Rodriguez followed with his 33rd. Griffey's homer was his 200th
over the past four seasons, and he joined Mark McGwire and Babe
Ruth as the only players to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Abbott's night. Starting for the third time since
replacing Jeff Fassero in the rotation, the right-hander took
another step toward earning a spot in the Mariners' 2000 rotation.
</P>
<P>
   It was one false step that kept him from the rotation this
spring. Abbott tore his anterior cruciate ligament covering first
base in winter ball and didn't make his debut until late June. An
effort like Monday night's was what the M's envisioned after he
went 3-1 last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really hoping he'd be the fourth or fifth starter,''
said pitching coach Stan Williams. ``It took a long time to get to
him, but what you saw tonight was not a mistake _ he's capable of
that. I thought he was better the last two innings than he was the
rest of the ballgame. The way he was throwing the ball the last two
innings, the hitters were overmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said he didn't feel especially sharp early in the game,
when he fell behind often and struggled with his release point. But
something clicked in the fifth inning, he said, and he executed
whatever pitch catcher Dan Wilson called.
</P>
<P>
   His command was so exceptional that Abbott threw effective
backdoor sliders to left-handers for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a little bit of a lead and have that luxury, you
can kind of experiment a little bit,'' Wilson said. ``It seemed
like all of our experiments were working. It was kind of nice. He
threw some sliders when maybe he wouldn't have in other situations,
and even then, he threw great pitches. What a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians admitted they were baffled, to use shortstop Omar
Vizquel's word. Vizquel, the Indians' leading hitter, was 0-for-3
with two strikeouts, flinging his bat to second as he lunged and
fanned in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a dominating changeup,'' Vizquel said. ``It didn't have
any rotation. It looked just like a fastball, only it would die at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was cheered warmly by a sold-out Safeco Field crowd of
44,689 after fanning Alomar on a 92-mph fastball to strike out the
side in the eighth. Abbott, who also struck out the side in the
first inning, gave way to Jose Paniagua after throwing 128 pitches,
35 more than he'd thrown all year.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua loaded the bases on two singles and a walk, and with
two outs walked Diaz to force in a run. It was the Mariners' major
league-high 23rd bases-loaded walk this year, and it brought Jose
Mesa in from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa was roundly booed as he strode to the mound, but hee struck
out Richie Sexson _ who hit the game-winning homer off him Sunday _
on a wicked curveball to earn his 28th save.

DREIFORT TAKES CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ For the past month the Los Angeles Dodgers have been
reduced to making personal statements rather than statements as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those statements come from the public relations staff,
but occasionally they're made on the field. Like the one
right-hander Darren Dreifort is in the process of delivering with
the subtlety of devastating right hook.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off his second career shutout, Dreifort outlasted a
two-hour, 10-minute rain delay to overwhelm the Milwaukee Brewers
8-4 Monday at soggy County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dreifort (11-12) wishes not to discuss his future role,
either as starter or reliever, it's clear which way he's forcing
the Dodgers. He's gained control of his ever-moving fastball and
slider, and the decrease in walks has led to increased
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   After going 3-7 with a 6.37 ERA through June and July, Dreifort
has answered critics by going 3-2 with 3.31 ERA. It's even more
impressive since Dreifort had one miserable outing this month, a
seven-run, six-inning debacle against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his location; he's just really hitting his spots,''
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``His slider is consistently
good.... He's nasty. I saw it when I faced him. I have to get my
glove fixed before the game when I catch him so it doesn't get
blown away. He's got a heavy ball. That's a God-given talent, to
throw a heavy ball with nails in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Dreifort shut out Florida in his last start, he had
completed seven innings just twice. The last time was June 24. In
allowing three runs in eight innings against the Brewers, Dreifort
pitched at least seven innings in back-to-back starts for the first
time this season. He walked one and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to make the adjustments,'' Hundley said. ``He
tried to do it (earlier in the season), but he wasn't able to do
it. I think (Kevin Brown) had a big influence on him, teaching him
how to pitch. Plus, the more innings he pitches the better he's
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort also extended his shutout streak to 152/3 innings
before Geoff Jenkins' RBI single with two outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, the now third-place Dodgers were cruising to
their fourth win in five games. It began when the oft-booed Gary
Sheffield singled in Eric Young in the first. The Dodgers then
showed uncanny, uncharacteristic patience at the plate in knocking
their former staff ace Hideo Nomo out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, a former Rookie of the Year for the Dodgers, walked four
batters in a five-run fifth inning, including three straight. Eric
Karros and Raul Mondesi had RBI walks before Devon White doubled in
three runs to give the Dodgers a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   While Nomo's downfall was all the free passes, that just happens
to be why Dreifort's been so successful. He spent the first 45
starts of his career walking batters.
</P>
<P>
   It hit rock bottom during an April start against Atlanta.
Dreifort allowed two hits in 51/3 innings but walked a career-high
nine. He walked 60 batters in his first 110 innings before the
control turnaround. In his last six starts, totaling 41 innings,
Dreifort has walked six batters.
</P>
<P>
   He yielded Jenkins' run-scoring single, then made one of his few
mistakes an inning later when Jose Valentin hit a two-run homer to
pull Milwaukee within 6-3. It was the Brewers' first homer in 14
games and broke a streak of plate appearances without a long ball
at 557.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally in control of the game,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``He really stepped it up in the eighth. It's nice to
look at nice pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has thrown a lot of strikes, got deep into the game and had
a low pitch count.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the loss, the signing of Nomo has worked out well for
the Brewers. Nomo (10-6) is second on the club in wins and leads
the staff with 116 strikeouts. And though he allowed six runs on
four hits in six innings, only one run was earned. The Dodgers'
five-run fifth was sparked by shortstop Jose Valentin's error.

   LOS ANGELES _ No longer maidens when it comes to dealing with
the NFL, Carson city officials are taking a guarded approach to
their latest contact with the league.
</P>
<P>
   With the L.A. Coliseum proposal for an expansion team teetering
over public money demands, league officials have asked Carson for a
letter of interest regarding an expansion franchise and stadium
site. The league has made the same request of city officials at two
other possible sites, in Inglewood (Hollywood Park) and Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Carson city councilman Daryl Sweeney said the city will submit a
letter of interest, ``but no one plans to get optimistic,'' he
said. ``There has been contact, but it's just been generalities.
They want to know if we're still interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson was actively interested for more than a year after being
wooed to the idea by Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz. But when the
league chose the Coliseum as its preferred site, Ovitz moved on.
</P>
<P>
   All of the plans for developing the Carson site, a former
landfill off the San Diego and Harbor Freeways, remain in place.
The city has access to $180 million for development of a
stadium/mall complex ($30 million cash, $150 million in bonds) and
is continuing to move on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said there have been several new inquiries for
developing the site. The city has also been proactive in getting
the site included in an environmental appropriations bill that
would make federal money available for cleanup. Sweeney said other
Southern California municipalities already named in the bill will
receive as much as $12 million if it is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thinking this time is that we don't want to get in a
position where we're leverage for someone else or backed into a
corner,'' said Sweeney. ``If the ball gets thrown back into the
air, I think we'll want to work more directly with the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 days remain before the league's self-imposed deadline
(Sept. 15) to put an expansion team somewhere in Los Angeles
expires. The league's expansion committee will meet Sept. 9 to
discuss the status of L.A. in advance of the deadline and a general
owners meeting Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still looking at the alternatives to the Coliseum, and
that includes the Carson site,'' said NFL spokesman Joe Browne.
``We're working as hard as we can to work something out in L.A.,
but we're not discussing anything beyond the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the league's deadline, which means the owners could
change it. Even if the expansion opportunity goes to Houston, that
wouldn't preclude the league from nurturing a stadium site in L.A.
should an existing team, such as the Raiders, want to move.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he wasn't surprised the Coliseum deal hit a snag
over public money. ``From day one, the NFL said two issues were
crucial to an expansion team, a public subsidy and parking. If I
knew this, why didn't the Coliseum and its supporters? This (the
collapse) was totally predictable. The only people who didn't know
it were those saying they'd already won.''

MAYOR CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS IS FAILING IN BATTLE TO TAME
MEXICO  CITY

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On one all-too-normal day not long ago, Pedro
Martinez and Dario Jimenez were reminded just how ungovernable
Mexico City is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scum!'' and ``Sons of whores!'' were the mildest of the
epithets shouted at Martinez when he screeched up in a convoy of
patrol cars into the middle of a neighborhood riot. A dozen
policemen desperately pulled two accused purse-snatchers away from
local residents who were defending them.
</P>
<P>
   The teenage suspects were thrown into another car, and the
convoy spun frantic U-turns and raced away down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people sympathize with the criminals, they hate
authority,'' Martinez said as he drove away, sweating.
</P>
<P>
   At the other side of the city, Jimenez, a city planning
official, didn't get far with locals he was trying to persuade to
move off the parkland they were squatting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to steal our land,'' one squatter replied in his
small shack, his family scowling behind him. ``No way we'll move.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez left the neighborhood, spluttering and hanging his head.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after sweeping into office as the most
powerful leftist elected politician in Latin America, Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has failed to bring substantial reform to
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   He has been stymied by immense problems: an endless crime wave,
rampant corruption, chaotic citizen protests and an unruly
bureaucracy controlled by the long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). But many observers say that no one, not
even Cardenas, who is recognized even by his enemies as stubbornly
incorruptible and pro-reform, could solve them.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City, with a metropolitan area population of 20 million,
is the biggest metropolis in the hemisphere and one of the largest
in the world. It is so gargantuan that it dominates Mexico
politically and economically in the same way as Washington, New
York and Los Angeles would the United States if they were one
mega-city.
</P>
<P>
   The intractability of Mexico City's problems indicates just how
difficult it would be for any opposition politician to govern
Mexico if the PRI is defeated in next year's presidential elections
_ a growing possibility.
</P>
<P>
   As the PRI's well-greased political machine is dismantled, it is
being replaced by a power vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to government, we expected that we would be able
to make concrete progress in resolving the city's problems,'' said
Jorge Legorreta, a former academic who is Cardenas' top official
for the large, crime-filled downtown district.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were quickly confronted by the subterranean actors, the
hidden power players in the city. These problems are much more
difficult to resolve than we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest roadblocks include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Urban sprawl. The capital has grown uncontrollably into the
extensive ``green areas,'' or designated parklands, climbing the
mountains on the city's south and west edges. Growth is propelled
by the annual arrival of 180,000 people from the countryside and by
corrupt officials who ignore zoning regulations _ and by Cardenas'
insistence on negotiations, rather than force, to dislodge
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hardball citizen politicking. Grassroots groups and average
citizens often adopt an aggressive, take-no-prisoners stance in
lobbying the government for services such as housing, utilities and
new schools. Sit-ins, land squatting and threats of violence have
long been standard for groups on all sides of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many social groups are extortionist, demanding money and
services from the government,'' said Elio Villasenor, an
urban-policy expert at Equipo Pueblo, a Mexico City think tank.
``There's no shared civic responsibility, no respect and lots of
low blows.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Pollution. Mexico City remains one of the world's most
polluted cities, with a yellow-brown haze that leaves residents
with seared nasal passages and watery eyes. The problem is defying
all efforts at remediation. Although emission rules have been
toughened for the city's 2.5 million vehicles, which have an
average age of about 10 years, corruption among smog-check centers
has made a mockery of the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   New forms of corruption have been invented to allow average
citizens to escape compliance _ for example, a sleight of hand
nicknamed the  &UR; caballito,  &LR; or little horse, in which a new car's
papers are substituted for those of old, smog-belching vehicles,
producing a clean bill of health for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Underpaid, corrupt cops. The city's 158,000 police officers
receive an average salary of only about $310 per month, barely
one-half of what a street vendor makes. As a result, corruption
continues under Cardenas despite several major purges, including
the firing of thousands of officers suspected of graft.
</P>
<P>
   -- Growing economic inequality and desperation among the poor.
``The lack of security is largely the result of a devastating
social crisis and worsening poverty,'' Legorreta said. ``The number
of delinquents has grown disproportionately.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Hostile, old-guard unions. About one-half of the 240,000
municipal workers are member of PRI-controlled unions, which manage
a complex web of corruption and exercise iron-fisted control over
their workers. Wildcat strikes _ more than 20 so far this year _
have shut down entire municipal departments and even cut water
supplies to large sectors of the city.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials, for their part, say the Cardenas administration
is simply in over its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas hasn't shown the experience or the efficiency needed
to manage the city,'' said Esteban Moctezuma, who resigned earlier
this month as the federal Minister of Social Development to manage
the presidential campaign of the PRI front-runner, Francisco
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``His government has been more than a bit disorganized and
chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all has been failure. By most accounts, Cardenas has had
some low-profile yet significant successes. He has rooted out
corruption in the middle and upper administrative levels. City
services, such as the oft-overflowing sewage system, are more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime has been reduced, and a wave of bank robberies has
stopped, although routine muggings and purse-snatchings are more
frequent than ever. At the same time, citizen complaints of police
brutality are less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most ambitiously, Cardenas has given city government a
whiff of real grassroots democracy, allowing increased citizen
participation in decision-making at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the extra democracy hasn't worked well. The
first-ever elections in June for a new system of nonpartisan
neighborhood councils were a failure. Only 15 percent of voters
went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   On the crime front, Citizen Security Committees _ sort of a
neighborhood watch program _ have been formed to help the police.
But as policeman Martinez found out, sometimes the good citizenry
take a dim view of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   And on city planner Jimenez's recent visit to the Tierra
Colorada shantytown, he got an earful when he met with local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of dozens of meetings that he's been holding since a
year ago, when he announced the city's plan to move the
neighborhood's 1,500 residents out of the formerly forested ``green
area'' that they had turned into a full-scale urban neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Jimenez's mission was daunting. Tierra Colorada is like most
of the city's 600-plus illegal squatter settlements, which hold
about 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   It was formed gradually since the early 1980s by migrants from
the countryside. Over time, through an anarchic process of
vote-selling and hardball negotiating, the residents acquired
scraps of paper that they said were legal property titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local PRI officials would give them information on what
parcel to squat on, then they would help them squat on it and
pretend to legalize their situation and give access to city
utilities, all in exchange for votes,'' said Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what they call titles aren't legal either. So what can we
do? We can't just throw them out. We have to negotiate. That's very
slow, and people want results a lot faster than we can give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez should know. A former student radical, he was an adviser
to leftist squatter groups for nearly 20 years. He fought the PRI
vote-buying system, with mixed success _ until Cardenas' triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the bureaucracy last year, Jimenez has found out
just how tough it is to govern honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move most of you to a smaller area where we'll
build you proper houses, with all the utilities,'' he told Carmelo
Guerrero, whose extended family looked on stony-faced. ``For
others, we're teaching solar energy and dry latrines. But it's
difficult because the people are suspicious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, we don't trust the government,'' Guerrero
replied. ``We've learned not to.''

CALIFORNIA HIGH COURT TOSSES OUT INDIAN GAMING RULING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Proposition 5, the high-stakes initiative to
expand legalized gambling on Indian reservations, was struck down
Monday by the California Supreme Court in a decision that tribes
say will be financially devastating.
<P>
   By a 6-to-1 vote, the high court said the measure, which
received an overwhelming 63 percent of the vote in November, is
illegal under a state constitutional ban on Nevada-style casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a lucrative victory for Las Vegas casinos and
voids the most expensive initiative battle in state history _ the
two sides together spent more than $91.3 million. It also raises
the specter of federal gambling raids on Indian casinos and sets
the stage for another costly election. One tribe is circulating an
initiative similar to Proposition 5 that would legalize gambling
through a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian people throughout California will suffer at the hands
of Nevada casinos,'' said Anthony Pico, tribal chairman of the
Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, located near San Diego. The tribe
was one of several that had backed Proposition 5.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis released a statement promising to abide by the
court's decision. But citing the overwhelming voter approval, he
said, ``I intend to work diligently to find a constitutionally
acceptable means of implementing the people's express will.'' He
said he will work with the Legislature, the tribes and all other
interested parties to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5 gave 40 of California's 107 American Indian tribes
the right to maintain and expand casino gambling on their
reservations. The initiative's implementation has been postponed
since December, when the state Supreme Court agreed to review two
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's decision, the court said the measure attempted to
legalize previously banned slot machines and ``banked table (card)
games,'' including blackjack, the most popular card game. Both are
popular features of the casino play in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
And both are outlawed under a 1984 amendment to the state
constitution specifically prohibiting Nevada and New Jersey-style
casino gambling, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The court also rejected the tribes' claim that their ``gaming
terminals'' are legally different from traditional slot machines.
The justices said they are still slot machines, even though they
are operated with buttons instead of levers and dispense chips or
credit instead of coins. The tribes say that those machines account
for about 70 percent of the gambling revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5 ``authorizes what would amount to prohibited
casinos,'' wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar in the court
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Joyce Kennard accused her
colleagues of rejecting the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   She said only federal law can authorize Indian gambling, and the
state can only impose conditions on operations. Kennard also
concluded that the tribes were operating lotteries, where the house
has no stake in the outcome, not prohibited banking games.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires states to allow the same type of gambling
on reservations that is legal elsewhere in the state. Tribal
leaders sought ballot approval after former Gov. Pete Wilson
refused to allow the casino-style expansion most tribes wanted. But
backers qualified Proposition 5 only as a proposed statute because
they believed they lacked time to get the additional signatures
needed for a state constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5 had been challenged by a group of residents and
businesses financed by Nevada casinos who opposed the expansion of
casinos near their communities. A separate suit had been brought by
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International
Union, which represents 3,500 employees at card clubs in the state
and 1,000 workers involved in Indian gaming. The union's main
objection is that Proposition 5 did not guarantee rights for union
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal chairman Pico said he hopes Monday's decision will prompt
the governor to step up continuing negotiations with the tribes,
which so far have been going at a slow pace. ``Now when we sit down
and talk, we won't talk about Proposition 5. I'm hopeful we're
still talking about allowing gaming on Indian land.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the initiative allowed tribes with gaming
operations to share their profits with other tribes.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Olson, a Washington D.C., lawyer who represented the
residents and businesses, cautioned that the court's decision
imposes restrictions on those negotiations. ``The governor cannot
agree to casino-style gambling,'' Olson said. ``It's quite clear
what the Indians are doing and proposed to do is clearly illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the voters may have the final say on the
future of Indian gaming.
</P>
<P>
   On the March ballot is a referendum, which, if approved by
voters, would overturn limited compacts negotiated by former Gov.
Pete Wilson and eight tribes. It is backed by the Agua Caliente
tribe, a Proposition 5 supporter and opponent of the compact, which
the tribe says is too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The same tribe is circulating petitions for a November measure
that would allow the same type of gaming approved under Proposition
5. But the initiative would be a constitutional amendment, which
would override the law the Supreme Court cited in striking down
Proposition 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribes will ultimately bring their case back to the
people, and the people will have the opportunity to amend the
constitution,'' predicted Mark Epstein, a Los Angeles attorney who
represented the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein said the tribes are still reviewing their options. But
it is doubtful that they will appeal the decision to the U.S.
Supreme Court, because the case turns solely on state law.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's decision, the court noted that the tribes had
advance warning that Proposition 5 would have trouble under legal
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   After it qualified for the ballot but before the November
election, the Legislative Counsel issued an opinion saying the
measure would be declared invalid under the state constitutional
prohibition on the type of casinos operating in Nevada and New
Jersey.

 &HT;    FEDERAL AUDITORS FAULT AIR FORCE PRACTICES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Air Force is taking incoming fire from
government auditors in two recent critiques, one for failing to
keep track of billings for flying VIPs and the other for
mismanagement that contributes to the shortage of military pilots.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers who travel as friends of VIPs, a federal study by
the General Accounting Office describes the ultimate bargain in air
travel: more than 4,500 flights a year to almost any spot on the
globe, and possibly no bill for six years, if then.
</P>
<P>
   But the taxpayers always get the bill, because the service is
provided by the Air Force's 89th Airlift Wing. The elite
20-airplane service operates Air Force One and provides air service
for diplomats, military brass, and members of Congress at a cost of
$357 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial guests who go along, as well as the news media, are
supposed to pay the equivalent of coach fare. The newly released
GAO report concluded that the Air Force kept such sloppy books that
it was impossible to tell who paid.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department accountants had no numbers, names,
billing records or collection records for the nonofficial
passengers, said the report. As a consequence, it concluded, ``no
one independently verified that all reimbursements were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the VIP air service were also noted in a GAO study
in 1992, after a controversy over use of the VIP fleet by
then-White House chief of staff John Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has since tightened rules on use of the aircraft,
but the latest report found little progress on collecting
reimbursements. ``It appears that the problem still exists,'' said
William Solis, one of the authors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, for example, non-defense agencies are
required to transfer funds to pay the Air Force for flying their
employees for official duties, but the study found the Air Force
took as much as six years to send bills.
</P>
<P>
   In its response, the Defense Department said it would reform its
bookkeeping on reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   In a second report, the GAO, which serves as the investigative
arm of Congress, traced the Air Force and Navy pilot shortage to
the doorstep of the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   As the services complain that they train pilots only to see them
lured away by private airlines, the GAO said the military has not
properly considered how many pilots it needs, why so many are
leaving, or what would keep them.
</P>
<P>
   A major cause of the current shortage was a decision to reduce
recruitment during most of the 1990s, the report said. And amid
stepped-up efforts today, training is hampered by the disarray in
the delivery of spare parts, which keeps planes grounded and delays
pilot graduation by as much as 40 weeks, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of pilots, the GAO also concluded that pilot
re-enlistment bonuses, which extend only through the 14th year of
service, will not be sufficient to hold them until retirement. Many
pilots complained that the cutoff at that point represented a pay
cut for the remainder of their career and an incentive to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot survey also found widespread dissatisfaction after
years of stepped-up deployments that have repeatedly mobilized a
relatively small percentage of Air Force personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Force pilots identified the frequency and length of
deployments and lack of clear mission objectives as their primary
concerns,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has projected that it would be short as many as
2,155 pilots between 1998 and 2007. The Navy problem reached a peak
last year, with a shortfall of 1,153 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the report, the Defense Department called
retaining pilots is ``a top priority'' and said that the department
would consider a GAO remedy of offering the option of a
``fly-only'' career to pilots.

   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CLIFFS-NOTES (Lincoln, Neb.) _ Down the street from the Nebraska
State Penitentiary, across from Midwest Turf and Irrigation, stands
a corrugated tin building, the kind found in industrial parks
across America. Drab and tan. Utterly utilitarian. Except for the
vivid, black-and-yellow stripes on the awning out front, the bumble
bee motif that has evoked Pavlovian responses of relief in
generations of students. This building is ground zero for a
phenomenon called Cliffs Notes. By MELISSA FLETCHER STOETJE.
</P>
<P>
   CLIFFS-NOTES-SIDEBAR (Lincoln, Neb.) _ If you don't have time to
read the in-depth story about Cliffs Notes, a shortened, a la Cliff
Notes, version is provided. By MELISSA FLETCHER STOETJE.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-AUCTIONS (Albany, N.Y.) _ On-line auctions let you
window-shop 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without wearing out
your feet or car. But be aware of the caveats before you start
clicking on that bid box. ``Don't jump in and buy on impulse,''
says Hank Hudepohl, an e-commerce analyst in Lincoln, Mass.
``People can easily get caught up in the fun or competition. It's
almost like gambling. So try to keep your cool.'' By FRANCES
INGRAHAM HEINS.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN-FURNISHINGS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Because of computers and
CD players, children are spending more time in their rooms. To that
end, designers have created entertainment centers, workstations,
comfortable upholstered chairs, plush pillows and attractive
accessories to make the rooms as friendly as possible. By FRANCES
INGRAHAM HEINS.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-CHILDREN (Undated) _ A look at some recent children's
books, including ``Princess Dress'' (Dial, $15.99) by Doris Dorrie,
Benedicte Guiettier's ``The Father Who Had 10 Children`` (Dial,
$15.99) and ``Red-Eyed Tree Frog'' (Scholastic, $16.95) by Joy
Cowley. By JANE P. MARSHALL.
</P>
<P>
   PEWTER (Albany, N.Y.) _ Most pewter will not tarnish or require
polishing if given proper care. Always hand wash pieces in hot,
soapy water soon after use, and never put pewter in a dishwasher,
because the heat-drying cycle may darken the surface. Rinse in
clear, hot water and dry with a soft cloth. By FRANCES INGRAHAM
HEINS.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``I have a hummingbird
bush that was given to me, but a friend has a different bush that
she calls a hummingbird bush. I only have a patio, so will mine
grow in a large pot?'' Assorted Q&AMP;As. By KATHY HUBER.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-AUTOS (San Francisco) _ The Internet is bringing change
to two more old world practices _ the kicking of tires on the auto
lot and the test drive. This year, more than 5 million new vehicle
buyers will use the Internet to gather information to help them
decide what vehicles to purchase, and as many as 5 percent of auto
purchases are expected to be made online by 2000, a new survey has
found. By GEORGE RAINE.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-BUSINESS (San Antonio) _ Companies have always hired
ex-military officers and enlisted men and women. But it's only been
in recent years that companies have popped up that exclusively
recruit from the military ranks. Fueling their growth is a tight
labor market, a strong desire among an underpaid officer corps to
find a better life and the growing recognition among corporate
leaders that the military produces some excellent managers. By L.M.
SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   INVESTMENT-BANKING (San Francisco) _ Not long ago, technology
financing was a small market ruled by investment bankers in San
Francisco and led by a few visionaries. Not anymore. Today,
high-tech financing is the largest and fastest growing sector in
investment banking, with brawny Wall Street firms dominating
mergers and acquisitions as well as initial public offerings. By
EDWARD IWATA.
</P>
<P>
   CIDER-BAR (Sebastopol, Calif.) _ Marilyn Renna tilts a pint
glass under the tap, fills the glass to the brim with an amber
liquid topped off by a slightly foamy head. She slides the pint
across the bar to a parched customer. It's a scene repeated
endlessly in bars and restaurants, but this pint is different: It's
brimming not with beer but with fermented ``hard'' cider. By DAVID
ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SPACE-ROBOTS (San Francisco) _ Two summers ago, the world was
enthralled by the skateboard-sized Mars robot, Sojourner, venturing
like an excited puppy around the Red Planet. But Sojourner looks
like a lazy pooch compared to the futuristic robo-critters being
developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. By
KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   SFO-PARKING (San Francisco) _ The civil grand jury has issued a
scathing report advocating the elimination of free VIP parking
privileges at San Francisco International Airport, saying the
system had become comparable to an ``old boy's network.'' The
report said the free parking program smacks of ``improper
favoritism'' and found that one airport commissioner doled out 27
of the passes, 12 more than commissioners hand out. By RAY DELGADO.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-REVIEWS-MYSTERIES (Undated) _ The San Francisco Bay Area's
own Richard North Patterson once again proves that he is at the top
of his game. His latest richly textured legal thriller, ``Dark
Lady'' (Random House, $25.95, 371 pages), begins with the bizarre
deaths of two of Steelton's most prominent men _ ``the drug
dealers' lawyer of choice,'' Jack Novak, and Tommy Fielding, the
general manager of the firm building a baseball stadium for the
Steelton Blues. By BOBBIE HESS.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MAINE-OUTDOORS (Freeport, Maine) _ Fly-fishing has been part of
the L.L. Bean business since its inception in 1912. Today, the L.L.
Bean Outdoor Discovery Schools offer instruction ranging from
introductory courses, such as a one-day workshop where anglers
learn the fundamentals, to an advanced trip to Western Maine. The
schools teach a little bit about the state's favorite recreations
and a lot about the outdoors. By JULIE COOPER.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Houston) _ The travel mailbox is frequently
filled with tales of woes. But once in a while, we encounter
someone who walks that extra mile to make our trips more memorable.
Good samaritans do still exist all over the world. By HARRY
SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-BERKELEY-BEARS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ This year's football
team at the University of California at Berkeley includes six
players with deep roots in Nigeria. Already there is talk of a
poster for ``The Nigerian Connection.'' By BRUCE ADAMS.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-HOMER-DERBY (Oakland, Calif.) _ Two good things can come
from this season's Sosa-McGwire sequel. One is variety: Sammy Sosa
wins the home-run title this time, toppling Goliath, tying or
breaking Mark McGwire's record of 70. The other is monotony. The
two sluggers make the public numb and we start to look around at
the other boys of summer, and we notice something more interesting,
more important to the long-term well-being of the game. By GWEN
KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Don't just take my word that the
California Legislature's ban on ``junk guns'' is junk. The most
pro-gun person and the most anti-gun person in Sacramento _ Green
Party Assemblywoman Audie Bock and National Rifle Association
lobbyist Steve Helsley _ both think it's junk, too. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Religious conviction is a
wonderful thing. Frankly, though, I'm getting sick of being beaten
over the head with the religious views of other people. I'm also
disturbed at seeing those convictions take on the force of law, as
seems to be happening in Kansas, where the state school board voted
effectively to ban the teaching of evolution in public schools. By
DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   WONG-COLUMN (Piedmont, Calif.) _ Recent hate crimes weigh
heavily on me. They are a reminder that no matter how American I
may feel, there are some Americans who will not see beyond my
so-called ``non-white'' features. They see me, and others like me,
and African Americans, and Latinos, and even ``white'' people who
are Jews and ``white'' people who are gays and lesbians, as
inferior or unworthy. They see us as targets of opportunity _ to
kill, to maim. By WILLIAM WONG.

 &HT;    Fear of bugs makes Canada trip a nightmare
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELEE ISLAND, Ontario _ For the last two nights I've been
sleeping on a camp cot on the front porch of a defunct restaurant
on the southernmost inhabited port of entry to Canada. For the last
two nights I've slept with a cricket under my bed and I don't know
who's jumpier, Jiminy or me.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs and I don't get along well, so when my ex-sister-in-law
Sharon (we used to be married to brothers but now we're not) told
me to pack up and get on the plane, I dragged my feet a bit trying
to wring out some answers to a few basic
</P>
<P>
   questions.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Are there any bugs?
</P>
<P>
   Sharon: Hmm? (an obvious stall)
</P>
<P>
   Me: Is there a toilet inside?
</P>
<P>
   Sharon: Three of 'em. It used to be a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Are there any bugs?
</P>
<P>
   Sharon: Hmm?
</P>
<P>
   I came anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The plane ride is cool because I've always been into anything
noisy with wings _ unless, of course, it's a bug. The trip lasts
only 10 minutes, so before I can say, ``I'm outta here'' and head
back to civilization, I find myself standing beside a grassy runway
with a change of underwear and a cooler full of hot dogs. Robin and
Pat are there to meet us. Sharon had told me I'd love them.
``They're as goofy as we are,'' were her exact words.
</P>
<P>
   The girls load us into ``Old Blue,'' a 25-year-old pickup with
cobwebs where the windows should have been, and head for the west
side of the island. They
</P>
<P>
   chit-chat while I check for spiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick a bed,'' Robin says, waving a hand in the direction of
the screened-in front porch. There are ten of them. I make like
Goldilocks and try a few,
</P>
<P>
   avoiding the corners where creatures with many legs might be
lurking. My first choice turns out to be full of sand. I complain.
Robin tells me to get over it
</P>
<P>
   and reminds me that I'm still on probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No complaining until you've been adopted into the family.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask when that might be. She just shrugs, picks up her ukulele
and breaks into raucous song.
</P>
<P>
   This clan to which I am being apprenticed does not fit the
standard definition of family. Rather, it is a collection of gently
worn, slightly over-the-hill broads who've known each other longer
than anyone cares to admit, hell-bent on enjoying life. Sharon
joined at the beginning of summer and has recommended me for
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Robin wraps up the second verse of ``Ain't She Sweet'' and
announces it's timefor a game of Skip-Bo. Never heard of it. Pat
pulls out the cards and Sharon
</P>
<P>
   begins clearing the round table. I beg off since I haven't
finished checking under my bed for crawly things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lizzie,'' Robin bellows, ``what in the hell are you doing?'' I
dust off my knees and confess. Robin shakes her head and reminds me
we're on an island and
</P>
<P>
   the bugs were here first. She also tells me where I can find
``sympathy'' in the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   It's well past the witching hour before the hotly-contested card
game ends and everyone settles down. ``Night, Pat.'' ``G`night
Sharon.'' ``Night, Robin.'' We
</P>
<P>
   sound like a rerun of the Waltons.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the night silence closes in, muffling all but the lapping
of the lake waves against the seawall just fifty feet from my bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chirrup!'' Silence. ''CHIR-RUP!'' It's stereophonic crickets
and they're homing in on me. I abandon my bed and somebody hollers
at me for jumping onto theirs. I try to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Robin's not buying it and tells me I'm being silly. ``You're
bigger than those bugs,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' I grumble, ``but they're uglier. They're waiting to
catch me off guard so they can eat my socks.'' Someone throws a
pillow. Somebody else groans.
</P>
<P>
   Robin reminds me I'm still on probation and that if I don't
shape up I won't be invited back next weekend for Thanksgiving
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August?'' I whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just not getting it,'' Robin warns Sharon in the
darkness. Somebody else sighs regretfully. I may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night, Sharon.'' ``G`night, Pat.'' ``Night, Robin and Mary.''
``Shut up
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth.''
</P>

 &HT;    Students as warheads
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Odessa Permian High should have listened to
Dorothy. What you're searching for you can find right in your
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The school went all the way to Sandia Laboratories, the nuclear
think tank in Albuquerque, N.M., for ways to make itself super
secure. Judging by the results portrayed in Time magazine, a
long-distance mission was unnecessary. All Permian High had to do
was toddle up to Texas's Wallace Unit, a minimum-to-medium security
prison for 1,500, and take snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Texans having to ask New Mexicans how to make a high
school into a prison. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Texas
invent prisons?
</P>
<P>
   Permian High is now a secure campus: A perimeter fence. Outdoor
security cameras. Cameras in every room. ID badges with bar codes
for scanning. Portable metal detectors. Drug and alcohol test kits,
and dogs at the ready for sniffing explosives or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Permian students are being schooled on a '90s version of the Red
Scare's ``duck and cover.'' In this case the drill is ``stop and
drop it,'' only it's no drill. School officials seal off a hall.
Every student puts down whatever he or she is carrying _ backpacks,
purses _ for a metal-detector swipe.
</P>
<P>
   We needed a nuclear scientist to advise us on this? Didn't
Stalin already write the book?
</P>
<P>
   At this stage _ hysteria, Code Blue _ we aren't supposed to be
pondering issues like whether students have any civil rights or
whether, in nuclear arms parlance, we have engineered a case of
mutually assured overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   We are to ignore the statistics that tell us that last year
nationwide school violence went down. Student drug use went down.
Weapon incidents went down.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be true, we say. We know what we saw on TV.
</P>
<P>
   What went up, of course, was ``incidents'' that involved pranks
and hoaxes. ``Incidents'' involving children questioned for saying
something scary. ``Incidents'' involving students acting out or
pushing someone's fashion envelope. (While most Columbine kids wore
white unity T-shirts back to school, a few wore black. Were SWAT
teams called?)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the new school year brings an armory attitude and,
one worries, a quest for thought control.
</P>
<P>
   A lonely but welcome voice on this matter has been Diana Philip,
Texas director of the American Civil Liberties Union. She writes
not just about the legal aspects of civil liberties on campus but
also the human aspects of a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools can lead the way in teaching tolerance and respect and
demonstrating that 'different isn't dangerous,' '' wrote Philip in
the Dallas Morning News. Instead, too often now it's just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Katz, a contributor to Rolling Stone, wrote a commentary on
``geek profiling'' on the Web site SlashDot. The real Columbine
story wasn't about gunfire but about a nationwide conformity
shakedown, ``a nightmare for kids who are different.''
</P>
<P>
   His words struck a chord with young people who had stories to
tell of being psychologically brutalized by peers and by their
schools. Their e-mails, by the thousands, caused the SlashDot site
to crash.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dual dimension to what we saw last spring, and in both
dimensions we must proceed with more moderation than we're prone.
On one hand you have the physical oppression of a security
crackdown. On the other hand you have the psychological crackdown,
with too little opportunity for the average kid to express what
might be going on in his or her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to mass perceptions, students do have rights, including
free speech rights reinforced by the Supreme Court in 1969. It put
a burden on schools to demonstrate that prohibited expression is
disruptive or disorderly.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but if we can convince ourselves that these are not students
but warheads waiting to detonate, we can dispense with all that.
</P>

 &HT;    MONEYTALK: Decide where to put your investment
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning investors have a number of choices to make as they
start building an investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   There are emotional questions, particularly regarding how much
volatility you can live with. There are knowledge questions,
involving how much you know about investing and how much time
you're willing to spend learning more.
</P>
<P>
   Another square-one decision is where you'll put your investment
money. Will it be in the comfort of mutual funds, or in the riskier
but sometimes more rewarding option of buying individual stocks?
</P>
<P>
   For some, the decision is already made.
</P>
<P>
   You may have a 401(k) plan that limits your choices to mutual
funds. You may work for a corporation that gives employees a
discount on company stock.
</P>
<P>
   But most people have room to make some decisions for themselves.
Lee Jenkins, an investment manager with Raymond James &AMP; Associates
in Atlanta, has been helping customers over this hurdle for 13
years. He has some interesting thoughts on the pros and cons of
mutual funds vs. stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds have important advantages. A major one is
diversification _ a basic need for all investors because it
diffuses your risk. ``The average mutual fund has about 100
stocks,'' Jenkins said. ``If one or two or three of them perform
very poorly, it won't affect the portfolio as negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   The second plus is that you are hiring a pro to manage your
portfolio. You don't have to pick all those stocks yourself, and
you don't need to worry about when to sell them or where the market
is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to look at it every day,'' said Jenkins.
``Someone else is doing the worrying for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds do have disadvantages, however. One is what Jenkins
describes as overdiversification. ``The problem is that there are
only so many good stocks out there,'' he explained. ``Your manager
may end up buying stocks he doesn't want to buy, just because he
has to put the money to work. No mutual fund manager has 100 great
ideas. He'll have 20 or 30 great ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem: You could take a beating in a down
market, even if you don't succumb to panic selling. Some investors
will panic, forcing money managers to make distress sales that
lower the value of shares held by less excitable investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Lynch said that the 1987 crash was a time he should have
been buying stocks for the Magellan fund,'' said Jenkins. ``But he
had to sell stocks to meet the redemption requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are a different matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage is that you can make a lot of money if you
pick the right stocks. If you bought Internet stocks in the last
few years, you were probably a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes you picked the particular Internet companies that
prospered, rather than road kill on the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is imperative that you don't make a mistake buying one or
two or three stocks,'' Jenkins said. ``If you get it wrong, you can
lose big, and there's nothing else in your portfolio to offset the
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investing in individual stocks has other advantages that
mutual funds do not.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can control your tax liabilities if you buy
stocks. A mutual fund manager buys and sells stocks all the time,
and each of those decisions can create taxable profits.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jenkins said, ``With an individual stock, if you
don't want to sell, you don't have to. You can let your gains run,
or you could rack up some losses to offset gains.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a psychological benefit to owning stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about owning a stock like Home Depot and
being able to drive down the street and see that big orange sign,''
Jenkins said. ``It makes you feel good. You've got more of a
feeling of security. It makes investing tangible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's that one huge disadvantage _ picking
your own stocks. It can be a complex, intimidating process. Even
the experts don't get it right all the time. If they did, they
wouldn't be making a living by telling you what to buy.

 &HT;    Strong economy makes business difficult for pawnshops
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ These are tough days in the pawn business.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy and record-low unemployment means fewer people
are in hock _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Pawnshops such as EZ Pawn, the nation's second-largest chain
behind Fort Worth's Cash America International, are feeling it.
</P>
<P>
   When it released its earnings recently, EZCorp., the
Austin-based parent of the EZ Pawn chain, said a ``soft pawn
economy'' and declining loan demand helped push down the company's
earnings in the fiscal third quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's loan volume is still growing, same-store
increases dropped to 13 percent from 17 percent a year ago.
EZCorp.'s gross profit margin also slipped to 13 percent from 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lambiase, EZCorp.'s chief executive, said the company
also is feeling price pressure from retailers selling new goods and
competition from more lax credit standards by credit-card issuers.
As a result, the company is lowering its price structure across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on current trends, we expect the slowdown in loan growth
and lower margins on merchandise sales to continue,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pawn companies' stocks are hurting, too. Shares in both EZCorp.
and Cash America recently hit 52-week lows. EZCorp. closed at $5.68
Monday, down nearly 43 percent from its high of $9.88 on Oct. 27.
However, it has rebounded from a low of $4.50 on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bostwick, 21, now goes to pawnshops to buy things, not
pawn them, since he graduated from college seven months ago and
started working full time as an assistant manager at a local
grocery store called Mr. Grocers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used them more when I was in school, only working part time,
and needed money,'' he said, leaving Doc Holliday Pawnbrokers last
week after buying some Game Boy tapes. He and his wife, Kerrylynn,
have bought a television and air conditioner from pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels better,'' she said of being a buyer instead of a
borrower. ``We're not worried about how to get something out. We've
got a little money now.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, pawnshops have been regarded as a bad-times
industry that thrives on economic downturns, according to Tom Horn
of the National Pawnbrokers Association. Pawnshops generally make
most of their money on loans to borrowers who put up merchandise in
return. Loans can range in value from less than $10 to several
hundred dollars,
</P>
<P>
   Pawn companies charge higher interest than banks, generally 15
percent to 20 percent per month. If borrowers fail to make their
loan payments, the pawnshops sell the collateral merchandise,
usually after 90 days. About 75 percent of customers return for
their items.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its reliance on loans, Horn said pawnshops are not
part of a counter-cyclical industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about a downturn in the economy, that means
people have a higher tendency to not come pay back the loans,''
Horn said, adding that the average loan is $72. ``Then the
pawnbroker ends up with no repayment and a floor full of jewelry
and electronics that he does not want,'' and which may not be sold
in times of recession, when customers avoid spending sprees.
</P>
<P>
   At EZCorp., the strong economy has Lambiase watching closely to
make sure his stores don't overextend credit now and suffer later.
</P>
<P>
   Lambiase calls the pawn business ``one of the most effective
barometers of the economy I've ever been involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Nagle, an assistant manager at South Lamar Pawn, one of six
area pawnshops owned by Action Pawn, said he started noticing a
drop in loan activity in March or April 1998. A lot more people are
paying off their loans, too, he said _ and taking less time to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early '90s _ '93, '94 and '95 _ were the best times, when
the economy was still down and everyone was getting over the
recession,'' he added. Inventory on the sales floor, items sold
outright or forfeited on loans, also is down these days, he said.
``It's kind of a seller's market right now,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him wrong, though. There still are plenty of people
coming to pawnshops for loans.
</P>
<P>
   There are always regular customers who depend on pawnshops to
help them make it to the next payday, said John Burch, manager of
an EZ Pawn store. ``And there are always emergencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davidson went to an EZ Pawn shop one day last week to hock
his golf clubs for $150. The computer consultant, who pulled up in
a Porsche and wearing a tie, doesn't exactly fit the pawnshop
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody wrote me a bad check,'' he said. ``I've got to get
some money in the bank to cover it. This is quick. This is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson promised he'd be back to EZ Pawn in two or three days
to pick up his clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pawn shop will charge me $15 interest,'' he said. ``That's
a lot less than the $75 the bank will charge.''

 &HT;    DNA tests sometimes help 'dad'
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Men challenging child support claims are
finding that genetic testing may be their best defense if they have
doubts about who's the father.
</P>
<P>
   The state uses DNA testing, a science of the 1990s, to identify
fathers; defense attorneys use it to contest paternity claims
brought against ex-husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Revenue, which enforces child support
payments, tested 1,025 fathers in Florida's Palm Beach, Martin,
Okeechobee and Indian River counties last year. A surprising number
had no genetic relationship to the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 36 percent of the cases, dad wasn't dad,'' said Dave Bruns,
a spokesman for the agency. He said the four-county region accounts
for about 10 percent of the DNA tests ordered across the state by
the department.
</P>
<P>
   DNA leaves no doubts, said Dr. Jerry Tankersley, who operates a
suburban West Palm Beach lab that collects blood or saliva samples
for genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a definitive, black-and-white, yes-and-no kind of a test
that does resolve the question,'' Tankersley said.
</P>
<P>
   The science may be indisputable, but DNA may not get all men off
the hook if they wait too long to challenge paternity, said Matthew
Nugent, a West Palm Beach attorney who specializes in family law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cases where people have shown that they are not the
father, but because they didn't object at the time of the divorce,
they are stuck with that judgment,'' Nugent said. ``In civil cases,
you don't get a second bite at the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, the 2nd District Court of Appeal issued an opinion
about a Central Florida man who suspected he was not the father,
but failed to raise the paternity question until nine years after
his divorce. The court said he could not escape child support
payments even though a DNA test proved he was not the father. The
man acted as legal father of the child for a decade and could be
obligated to continue paying ``as a matter of contract law,'' the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before that opinion, a Wellington man fared better in
Palm Beach County Circuit Court on his challenge of a 1986
child-support judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Murray, 40, had claimed he married in 1984 thinking that he
was the biological father of his bride's 2-year-old daughter. The
couple had another child during the marriage and divorced in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Murray says he did not know he wasn't the girl's father until
1994. During the first eight years after the divorce, Murray fell
$32,675 behind in child support for both the girl and his son.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-wife, Shelley Akins, has testified that Murray had ``full
knowledge'' when they married that the girl wasn't his and agreed
to raise her as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Akins' testimony in 1994, the courts wouldn't relieve
Murray of his obligations to the girl without a DNA test. Murray
said he waited until March to have the testing because he couldn't
afford the $500 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The test, which uses blood or saliva samples from the mother,
child and alleged father, showed Murray's probability of being the
father at zero percent.
</P>
<P>
   So Circuit Judge Roger Colton on June 25 erased Murray's debts
for the girl. The ruling left Murray with $15,057 in past debts for
his son. Murray says he cannot pay the debt or his continuing
$40-a-week payments to the son because he's unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Family-law attorneys say Murray probably would not have won the
ruling had the mother objected to DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   While the state spends $1.6 million a year on DNA tests to
determine paternity, it will not pay for tests to disprove
paternity, Bruns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When fathers come to us, our position is that it's an issue
they need to take up with the court,'' Bruns said. ``Our job is not
to prove a man is not the father; our job is to collect child
support from the father.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the man accepts paternal responsibility in a divorce or
other court proceeding, the revenue department ``generally
opposes'' DNA testing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DNA paternity testing is booming, partly because states like
Florida require a woman applying for public assistance to name a
child's father. The American Association of Blood Banks, which
licenses genetic labs, estimates 250,000 DNA paternity tests were
done nationwide in 1997, compared to 75,000 tests using mostly
blood samples in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Men are wrongly named ars in about one third of paternity
tests, said Dr. Elizabeth Panke, director of Genetica DNA
Laboratories in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Panke said most of Genetica's tests are to establish paternity,
but not all for child support. Some unmarried couples want the test
so their children can qualify for the father's retirement and
insurance benefits.

 &HT;    Solution to hairstyle conundrum is cut and dried
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Get this.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fulp was so protective of her hip-length hair that when she
lived in Nashville, Tenn., she would fly to Ocala, Fla. to get it
cut. She trusted no one else. Even when she moved to Tequesta,
she'd drive the three-plus hours to her hometown for a trim.
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida heat got to her. Earlier this summer, Fulp
ducked into some nameless local salon and got 6 inches whacked off,
a stunning amount for her. ``My hair is part of me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her hairstyle hadn't changed since high school, but Fulp was
finally in the mood. If she left her hair down, her two kids pulled
it. If she put it in a top knot, she noticed hair loss at her
temples.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to the Babor Institute in Palm Beach for a makeover
_ on her 33rd birthday, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what to do with it,'' she told stylist
George Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott listened to her hair history _ never any color, a perm
or two _ and learned that Fulp stays home to take care of the kids
and renovate the house. ``I want it to be easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: Fulp's husband, Bob, would pass out if she came
home with short hair. No problem. ``It's nice one length,'' Elliott
said. ``Long and pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   But heavy. Elliott immediately trimmed 3 more inches, and
suddenly Fulp had the shortest hair she'd had in years. For extra
bounce without extra time in front of the mirror, Elliott gave Fulp
a loose body perm.
</P>
<P>
   While she waited for the perm to set, Fulp plotted. Why not buy
a short blond wig on the way home and shock poor Bob into fits?
</P>
<P>
   Elliott put Fulp in hot rollers to give her hair some temporary
lift. Makeup artist Julia Holguin reached for earth tones _ light
brown and blue-gray on the eyes, natural beige foundation, and
maroon lipstick for Fulp's strongest feature, her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warm is her most natural look,'' Holguin said.
</P>
<P>
   Once primped and spritzed, Fulp said she felt lighter and
fluffier already.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she was happy to report that she could wear her
hair down, even while swimming, and it didn't get in anyone's way.
</P>
<P>
   And the wig?
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't find one in time to fool her husband, but she got
him anyway. ``I pulled back my hair so it looked short,'' she said.
``Boy, he had a funny look.''

 &HT;    From Bruise to Urban Putty, new shades give products very
distinctive flair
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The color purple appears to have lost respect.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the hue itself is still popular. But to call it ``purple''
is passe.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren calls it Victory. Urban Decay calls it Plague.
(Think of putrefying flesh. Who cares if you've never seen
putrefying flesh; use your imagination.)
</P>
<P>
   A rose by any other name, it appears, will sell better. And when
there are a bazillion shades of rose cosmetics or crayons or paints
on the market, giving them all specific, sometimes strange names is
a practical way to tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say pink, that's meaningless today,'' says Margaret
Walch, executive director of the Color Association of the United
States, which forecasts color trends for various industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I say Gwyneth Paltrow Pink, you know right away what I
mean,'' Walch adds, referring to Paltrow's Oscar ceremony dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greater range of colors being used today. So there's
a trend toward fancier names.''
</P>
<P>
   So nothing is just blue anymore. Increasingly it's not even navy
or sky or lapis.
</P>
<P>
   Today's color names include Raw, an iridescent purplish-blue
nail polish made by Revlon, and Aristocratic, a pastel blue paint
offered by Glidden.
</P>
<P>
   Khaki, the color that lent its name to the go-with-everything
pants, has spawned cousins such as Stone, Putty, Palomino and
Lichen.
</P>
<P>
   Lichen would be that patchy fungus-algae stuff that grows on
rocks. Unappealing perhaps, but tame compared to the names some of
the hipper cosmetic companies invent.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Decay favors names with a high ick factor, such as Gash
(blood red) and Roach (dark brown). BeneFit has naughty names like
But Officer (peachy brown), Should I Call (ash brown) and Traffic
School (bronze).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Hard Candy, which goes with color names that might
appear in a movie starring kids from the WB. Jailbait is iridescent
white; Frigid is a glittery ice blue and Trailer Trash is silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much competition among cosmetic companies these
days. When they add a little bit of flair, it helps them stand
out,'' explains Kelli Holzer, a manager at Sephora, a new cosmetic
store at Lenox Square mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might forget smoky beige, but you won't forget Marcia
Marcia Marcia,'' she says, referring to a bubble-gum pink nail
polish by Too Faced.
</P>
<P>
   Who comes up with these names, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Linda Trent, who singlehandedly has named all the
paints for Sherwin Williams for 18 years. That isn't all she does,
but naming colors is one of her favorite job responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a wordsmith in my own right, so I enjoy the whole
process,'' Trent says from her Cleveland office.
</P>
<P>
   The tools of her trade include a dictionary, a thesaurus,
gardening books and fashion and cooking magazines. Witness colors
such as Pomegranate, Wine Country and Sun-Dried Tomato, all of
which are reddish derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that if a color has a good descriptor, it really does
help a customer understand the ambiance that will result from
choosing that color,'' Trent says.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Putty, for instance, is probably appropriate for a sleek,
sophisticated loft with angular furniture and aggressively modern
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that you can't use it in a four-bedroom colonial in the
suburbs,'' Trent hastily adds. ``But it just has that feel about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to communicate with the customer, the Color
Association's Walch says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a name. So I can deal with you,'' she says. ``If you
didn't have a name, it would be very difficult for me to deal with
you. A color has the same rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Colors not only have rights, it seems, but responsibilities.
Last month, Crayola renamed its Indian Red crayon Chestnut, to
applause from the National Congress of American Indians. It was
only the third time in Crayola's 96-year history that the company
renamed a color.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies avoid the whole issue _ and disregard the
conventional wisdom about the market appeal of color names _ by
numbering their colors. Fashion designer Anna Sui, who recently
introduced her own line of makeup, opts for numbers, as does
Benjamin Moore paints.
</P>
<P>
   Walch, who prefers names for colors, nonetheless recently used
Benjamin Moore to paint her apartment. But the numerical labels
irked her. ``I believe I used Number 303,'' she recalls. ``Or it
could have been 202. There you go. I totally cannot remember. If it
had a name, I could remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Colors with names can even make chores like redecorating more
pleasant, Trent maintains. ``It adds a sense of fun and fantasy, so
painting isn't just drudgery,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Tell that to Colin Green, who spent an entire morning
painting his bathroom in Ralph Lauren's River Rock, which turned
out to be exactly the wrong shade of off-white.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more gray than white, and the second coat didn't go on
well at all,'' Green complained while shuffling paint chips at a
Home Depot in Smyrna.
</P>
<P>
   River Rock so depressed him that he immediately got in his car,
paint-spattered ankles and all, and drove back to Home Depot so he
could redo the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   He squinted at another Ralph Lauren color, Breakwater White,
which is brighter than River Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably the name tells what the designer was going for,''
Green said, somewhat dubiously. ``But whites have got to be the
hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Shades of white do seem to have the most fanciful names. Glidden
has a white shade called Scented Candle, which has a pale pink
tint. In an informal poll around the office, those surveyed utterly
failed to answer ``pinkish white'' when asked to guess what color
Scented Candle might be.
</P>
<P>
   Arctic themes seem to be popular for white paints. Behr has
three closely related shades of white named Polar Bear, Snowsquall
and Winter's End, all of which look so alike only an Alaskan could
tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmetics, deep reds often have names of ill repute, like
Hard Candy's Tramp, BeneFit's Liar Lips and Stila's Pandora.
Remember, Pandora was the girl in Greek mythology who opened up the
box that let sorrow and pain into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having previously offended minority groups with Flesh (now
Peach) and Indian Red, Crayola seems to now favor wholesome
all-American names, like Macaroni and Cheese (orange, of course)
and Purple Mountain Majesty (yep, purple).
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Glidden has a shade called Mountain Majesty, which is
dark teal. Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren's Sea paint is actually forest
green.
</P>
<P>
   Color naming, Trent allows, ``is not a hard science.''

 &HT;    African decor centers on family, spirit
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Walk into Curtis Polk's Pflugerville home, and
you notices three things: Texas-size furniture, warm colors and
artworks by well-known African American artists Keith Mallett and
Albert Fennell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come into your home, you need to feel comfortable,''
Polk said to explaining the furniture and the sky-blue and
earth-brown colors. Yet it's the lithographs and radiographs that
broadcast the Polk home's soul, especially the work of Mallett.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Mallett lithographs Polk purchased hangs over
the corner fireplace in the living room. The picture features three
black women with different shades of skin complexion, which Polk
said appeals to his sense of cultural diversity. On the connecting
wall is another lithograph of an African American father holding a
child with a swatch of multicolored Kente cloth. The lithograph is
hangs above an ample love seat that matches the room's textured,
multihued sofa and armchair. Across the room from the television is
Polk's favorite armchair and above it are two radiographs by Albert
Fennell. The black-background drawings, one of a man and one of a
woman, are mounted in a single frame. Polk said he wanted the two
artworks together to illustrate the importance of couplehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Mallett's artwork is related to the family, men and
women, relationships and children,'' Polk said. ``It makes me think
of my family, think of times back in the day. I always had the love
and care of my parents in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Polk said, the artwork is about having beautiful images of
people who look like him and infusing his home with art that speaks
to his African American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone: Today, more people are permeating their home,
and sometimes office, decor with artworks and artifacts that
reflect the African American experience or connect them to Africa.
Polk and other Austinites speak of cultural heritage and
spiritualism when they talk of their desire to combine African
American and African art in their homes. They are taken by the
colors, intricacy of the handwork and form and shape of the pieces
they have acquired.
</P>
<P>
   And they are very much in step with a decorating sentiment that
has gained momentum since the 1980s among middle-class Americans,
who are making African motifs and palettes a style basic in
interior design.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 40 years, Bertha Means has regularly traveled the
African continent, visiting family and friends in several nations.
Each time she returns to her Northwest Austin home, pieces of those
journeys come with her in hand-crafted artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The most beloved piece is probably the Ethiopian pictograph
depicting the ancient legend of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba
in the dining room. ``When I look at it now, it brings back family
memories,'' said Means' granddaughter Inning Khabele-Stevens, whose
parents had a similar pictograph hanging in their home.
</P>
<P>
   Through the decades Means' collecting included items such as an
old Benin bronze head of a man that sits on an ivory-colored
pedestal near the living room. Adorning the dining room table is a
Kenyan sculpture hand-carved from a single piece of mahogany that
features several interlocking human figures.
</P>
<P>
   But ``African art was never created for its own sake. It was
made to communicate or reinforce morals, values and principles,
such as respect for the ancestors or elders, motherhood or for the
kingship,'' said Khabele-Stevens, a local artist who grew up in
Botswana, Nigeria and Lesotho before moving to Austin as a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   To Western people, African art is beautiful and intriguing, said
Khabele-Stevens, who studied African art and history in college.
But to Africans, ``the purpose of art is a reminder of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVonne Mason has a deep affection for old African masks and
antique European-style furniture. She has blended both aesthetics
in her Northwest Austin home. She said her attraction to the masks
started in the early 1970s when she purchased her first pieces,
such as the large, impressive black and gold tribal mask in the
living room. ``It has lots of character,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   A spiritual connection
</P>
<P>
   While Mason consulted with Jan Moss, an Arlington, Texas-based
interior designer, in selecting art and other furnishings, a source
for anyone wanting to incorporate the African-inspired design
aesthetic in their home is the book ``The Spirit of African
Design'' (Clarkson Potter, $35) by Sharne Algotsson and Denys
Davis, interior designers from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The African-inspired aesthetic isn't just about stylishly
placing artifacts, textiles and art in a room, Algotsson said, it's
about making a cultural and spiritual connection between the home's
decor and the people who live in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to express their love of Africa in their home,''
Algotsson said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the African aesthetic complements any decorating style,
whether it's traditional or contemporary, formal or funky,
Algotsson said it is becoming a design staple _ much like French
provincial or American traditional _ going into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people consciously keeping it a design
style,'' Algotsson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, art in the African aesthetic meant expensive,
rare pieces that were off limits to the average person. Those who
acquired it were in the high-end art market or worked for
museums,'' Algotsson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, African American and African art is in the mainstream.
Giant retailers, such as Pier 1 Imports and JCPenney, have these
home furnishings. ``These companies wouldn't be investing in
African design if they didn't see its staying power,'' Algotsson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waly Faye, owner of Goui-Gui in Austin, said he has seen the
African-inspired design aesthetic grow in the 10 years he has
imported art, crafts and artifacts from his native Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Djembe drum, which is native to his homeland,
is often purchased because the buyer thinks it will look nice in
the home. But, Faye said with a smile, ``you never know when one
will start playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to bring in things the people will appreciate,'' Faye
said.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the day, as Polk said, you must be comfortable
in your home. African American art and African-inspired design
makes that possible for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when I look at the African masks, I think that could
be somebody I know, somebody I grew up with,'' Polk said. ``I like
Picasso, would love to own a painting, but his art doesn't look
like me.''

</P>
<P>
   African design tips
</P>
<P>
   Design elements: The elements of African-inspired design are as
wide-ranging and multifaceted as the continent that inspired the
style, but most of the objects, artifacts and art have some
spiritual and/or cultural connection to Africa or the African
American experience. Some key points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Colors are usually warm and/or vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most patterns are intricately designed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Objects, such as quality sculptures and masks, are created by
hand and of natural materials, such as wood or clay.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive flair: Large pieces of hand-woven African textiles
can be expensive, but an affordable alternative is to buy a yard or
two for throw pillows as accents for sofas, chairs or beds.
</P>
<P>
   If original paintings or drawings are beyond the budget, most
well-known African American artists produce affordable prints of
their work that are suitable for framing.

 &HT;    NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Ceiling-fan fix is a breeze
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ceiling fans help keep you cool inexpensively, and they're an
excellent supplement to air conditioning. But occasionally fans
develop wobbles that cut down on their efficiency and make them
noisy and annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Often you can correct a shimmying fan, but it may take a little
time and experimentation before the fan is running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inspection
</P>
<P>
   You may be able to get an idea about what's causing your fan to
wobble just by observing it carefully while it's running. Turn it
on and watch how it operates at different speeds. Most fans have
high, medium and low settings, and you change from one speed to
another by pulling a chain.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the fan in motion, turn it off and get on a
ladder for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Manually move the blades around and look for obvious differences
in the blades. For instance, is one blade pitched at a different
angle or obviously warped?
</P>
<P>
   With a tape measure or yardstick, measure the distance from the
ceiling to the tip of a fan blade. Leave the tape measure in the
same position and rotate the next blade around to see if it is the
same distance from the ceiling. Repeat with each blade, noting if
any are out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Like a tire on your car, a fan must be balanced and perfectly
level or it can't spin in a smooth, level manner.
</P>
<P>
   Take a careful look at all the brackets (sometimes called blade
irons) that hold the blades of the fan to the motor housing. All of
them should be in good shape and affixed at exactly the same angle.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, inspect the hardware holding the fan to the ceiling.
Cut power to the fan circuit by disengaging the circuit breaker or
removing the fuse connected to the fan.
</P>
<P>
   With a helper supporting the weight of the fan, loosen the
covering over the support system at the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Ceiling fans should be attached to an electrical box affixed
securely to a cross bar or bracket attached between two ceiling
joists. An electrical box is a square or hexagonal box of plastic
or metal used to wire outlets, ceiling lights or fans.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases you may find the fan has been attached to an
electrical box screwed through one side to a single joist. In other
cases, you'll find the fan attached directly to a plaster or
drywall ceiling using bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these methods are adequate to keep a ceiling fan
steady and should be replaced. Consult a ceiling-fan retailer for
advice on rehanging your fan.
</P>
<P>
   If the fan is properly installed, tighten all the screws holding
it in place and reattach the cover. Also tighten the screws holding
the blades to their brackets.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring balance
</P>
<P>
   Earl Elworth, manager of Dan's Fan City in Miami Township, Ohio,
said tightening the hardware sometimes significantly improves the
fan's performance. But most often more tinkering is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to your observations from earlier and start working on
correcting any problems you noticed.
</P>
<P>
   A badly warped blade must be replaced, Elworth said. If you
suspect a blade is warped, remove it from its bracket by loosening
the screws. Place the blade on a flat surface to see if it is
level.
</P>
<P>
   If one or more blades on the fan are warped, Elworth suggests
replacing the entire set. The chances of finding one blade that
perfectly matches the shape, look and weight of the others on a fan
are fairly slim, and you should be able to find a whole replacement
set for about $15 to $30 where fans are sold.
</P>
<P>
   If the blades are all good, try adjusting the brackets to make
sure the blades are properly aligned. If the tip of one blade is
lower or higher than the others, firmly grasp the bracket and
gently try to bend it back into line.
</P>
<P>
   Elworth said this is easiest with inexpensive fans with
relatively lightweight brackets. Sturdier brackets are less likely
to get out of line, but when they do go bad they're very difficult
to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Sets of replacement brackets are also available for about $15 to
$25, Elworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this brings up a point I've made before: It doesn't
make a lot of sense to spend $25 on trying to fix a 10-year-old fan
that was only worth $50 in the first place. Sometimes it's better
to shop for a better fan.
</P>
<P>
   If the blades are aligned and the fan still wobbles, the problem
might be in the balance of weight between the blades. Correcting an
imbalance is basically a trial-and-error process.
</P>
<P>
   Try switching the positions of some of the fan's blades. Take
off two adjacent blades and swap their positions. Turn on the fan
at different speeds to see if there's any improvement, then repeat
the process with the other blades.
</P>
<P>
   If the fan still wobbles, you may need to add weight to one of
the blades. Dan's Fan City and other retailers sell inexpensive
balancing kits (about $2) that may help.
</P>
<P>
   The kits come with a plastic clip that is fastened to the rear
edge of a blade. You attach the clip and run the fan to see if the
added weight helps the performance. Repeat with each blade and
compare your results.
</P>
<P>
   If adding weight to a particular blade corrects the wobble, you
remove the clip and affix a small weight that comes with the repair
kit.
</P>
<P>
   You can accomplish the same thing without a balancing kit by
testing the fan with metal washers and tape. When you find the
blade that needs weight, permanently install the washer by slipping
it over the bolt holding the blade to its bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fan is balanced, it should continue to run smoothly
without much maintenance. Consult your owner's manual for tips on
taking care of the fan, but an occasional dusting with a soft brush
or lint-free cloth is typically all they need.
</P>
<P>
   Elworth said many fan owners use dusting devices specially
designed for ceiling fans. The devices have poles with looped
brushes on the end that are slipped over the fan blades to clean
the tops and bottoms of the blades at once.
</P>
<P>
   Elworth said extreme care should be used when using such
devices. He said many customers have damaged fans by bearing down
too hard while dusting their blades.

 &HT;    Five issues that might determine the success of the Cowboys
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ They talk a good game and still look
slick in those silver uniforms. The who's who list of NFL
superstars contains a fair share of Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But just how battle ready is the 1999 Cowboys edition?
</P>
<P>
   A month of training camp in the unmerciful Texas sauna has
yielded more questions than answers. Dallas is the league's mystery
team. Depending on which voice you trust, the Cowboys will finish
the season anywhere from 6-10 to 12-4. They can be a Super Bowl
contender or a team that dies before New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Have these guys become a bore?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three weeks remaining before the opener in
Washington, here are five tough issues that might determine the
success of the NFL's most intriguing cast of characters:
</P>
<P>
   1) The Spellman factor
</P>
<P>
   For the record, defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban was the team's
first-round draft choice four months ago. In reality, the Cowboys
had an extra first-round pick, former Bears lineman Alonzo
Spellman. It isn't certain whether Spellman is a career bust or
someone who can rejuvenate a defensive line that has been ranked
30th out of 31 NFL teams by one magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The bipolar disorder that nearly ruined his professional life in
recent years appears under control. Spellman's arms and legs look
as strong as oak branches. His steely eyes seem fixed on
recapturing past excellence. When asked what he brings to the
Cowboys, Spellman offered a puzzled look before responding,
``You'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavika Pittman led the Cowboys with six sacks last season. Since
1964, no sack leader in Dallas has ever had fewer than six. Some
believe Spellman, who was shifted from end to tackle on Monday, is
capable of 10.
</P>
<P>
   But does he have the desire to play football again?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the best frame of mind he's been in for the last four
or five years,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``I've
spoken many times about Alonzo to (Bears Coach) Dave Wannstedt and
people on his defensive staff. They describe him as humble, someone
who wants to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't take the Cowboys long to find out whether they still
are suspect on the line. In the second week of the season, they
will face Atlanta's Jamal Anderson, arguably the league's most
powerful insider runner.
</P>
<P>
   Will Spellman make a difference? We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   2) Rocket power
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin arguably are the
best 1-2-3 offensive combination in league history. They have led
the Cowboys in passing, rushing and receiving eight straight years,
the only time the same three players led their teams in those
respective categories.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the so-called triplets, the most
important piece to the offensive puzzle just e receiver
Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   The triplets are as predictable as a Julia Roberts movie, but
they no longer can carry a team by themselves. The only player who
can stretch opposing defenses _ giving more room for the triplets _
is Ismail. He had 69 catches for Carolina last year and has shown a
knack for catching deep passes in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail is the best deep threat in Dallas since Alvin Harper left
town four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   3) Troy's blind spot
</P>
<P>
   Ask any draft expert to name the team's most important _ and
perhaps best _ pick over the last five years, and Flozell Adams is
the overwhelming choice. The same player whose quickness and
hearing ability were questioned before the 1998 draft enters the
season with one of the team's most important duties _ protecting
Aikman's back.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has moved to left tackle, a position that has been filled
admirably by Larry Allen and the late Mark Tuinei for almost all of
Aikman's 10 seasons in the league. Aikman has been sacked fewer
than 20 times in five seasons, a remarkable number for someone on
the field as much as he is.
</P>
<P>
   Some have said the health of the team is only as strong as
Aikman's health. For now, the transition of Adams to left tackle
has been a success. Few defensive linemen have beaten him at
practice and, at 6 feet 7 inches and 335 pounds, Adams is among the
NFL's biggest men.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work as hard as Flozell works, and you have the pride
that he does, it makes you a hard man to beat,'' offensive line
coach Hudson Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   4) Behind closed doors
</P>
<P>
   One of the most confusing questions of the summer stems from the
status of Leon Lett. The most talented defensive lineman in Dallas
for a decade will serve a drug suspension at the start of the
season. But for how long? If you want an answer from Coach Chan
Gailey, look elsewhere. Gailey doesn't lie, and he claims to be
clueless on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Dallas questions whether it is fair for Lett to serve
a suspension. Many expect it will be four games, but it could be
six, eight, or even more. Commissioner Paul Taglabue's delay of the
case is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys expected a decision on Lett's status in July, just
before camp opened in Wichita Falls. That would have been fair.
Knowing how long Lett would be suspended would allow the Cowboys to
plan accordingly. If it's longer than four games, for example, team
owner Jerry Jones might choose to find a suitable tackle elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As camp prepares to close for the summer, the Cowboys are still
in the dark. Maybe Jones knows the length of the suspension and has
been told to stay quiet. A good poker player knows when he has a
good hand, and Jones does not seem overly concerned by the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lett, by contrast, deserved to know the severity of his
suspension long before this.
</P>
<P>
   5) Confidence shaken
</P>
<P>
   The Aikman/Smith/Irvin era has been measured by Super Bowls,
something the Cowboys haven't sniffed since the end of the 1995
season. They have not made another serious challenge since then,
and it is becoming increasingly difficult to believe this year will
be any different.
</P>
<P>
   Some must wonder whether they believe it themselves. Arizona
embarrassed the Cowboys in the first round of last year's playoffs.
This summer the Cowboys haven't won a preseason game. They even
lost to the Browns. Such talk about the preseason has always been
dismissed, but it has been disturbing to see the first-team offense
and defense struggle through three games.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons Dallas no longer resembles the team
that won with ease early in the decade. Only 10 players who were on
those three championship teams remain, and they do not have enough
help from their young teammates to make another run.
</P>

 &HT;    Jail to add services for Muslim inmates
 &HT;    (EDS: For clarity, meeting between ACLU, prison officials was
held Friday, Aug. 20.)
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ As the rest of the Muslim world fasted
during daylight last December in observance of the month of
Ramadan, it was business as usual for Muslim inmates at the St.
Lucie County Correctional Center: Eat now or go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, changes are in the works, said Sieg Christman, president of
Florida's Treasure Coast chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   After organization members met with St. Lucie County sheriff's
officials Friday, the jail has agreed to allow Ramadan observance
for the jail's eight Muslim inmates. It also has agreed to allow a
Jumu'ah prayer service once a month, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU officials, who asked for weekly services on Friday, said
they're thankful, but that the accommodations aren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of happy, but then we're sort of disappointed,
too,'' Christman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jeffries, an attorney for the St. Lucie County Sheriff's
Office who went to last week's meeting, said inmates had requested
services before but that scheduling Jumu'ah services was difficult
because of space constraints and jail schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholics only have Mass once a month,'' he said. ``Just
physically, it can't be done every week.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the jail would accommodate weekly services if it could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a very fruitful meeting and I think they were
genuinely surprised that we were doing all we did,'' he said,
explaining that inmate meals exclude pork, which can't be eaten
during Ramadan, an extended ritual of fasting believed to have been
commanded by Allah.
</P>
<P>
   He said inmates will be given bag lunches and dinners during
Ramadan _ which lasts either 29 or 30 days, depending on the year _
so that they can eat after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   But M. Zaman Marwat _ an imam who has been asked by ACLU
officials to lead services at the jail _ said that the religion's
worship practices cannot vary. He said he would not lead services
at the jail if Jumu'ah is allowed only once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we can't do it this way or that way,'' he
said. ``It's only one way it can be done. . . . It's not done for
the individual. It's done for our creator. It's his command and we
have to fulfill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Muslims are obligated to pray five times a day, he
said. On Jumu'ah _ the Muslim word for Friday _ one of the prayers
is replaced with a two-hour communal prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Marwat leads weekly services at the state prisons in Martin and
Okeechobee counties, he said. While inmate conversions to Islam are
a growing jailhouse phenomenon, ACLU officials said the St. Lucie
inmates were practicing Muslims before their incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volunteer from our board actually went out and talked to
mostly the inmates' mothers, sisters, and other relatives, who
confirmed that they had actually been practicing Muslims before,''
ACLU attorney Rosemarie Richard said.

   CNN-KAPLAN _ ATLANTA _ Two years into the reign of Rick Kaplan
at CNN/U.S., he has changed the corporate culture and the network's

everyone at CNN likes the changes, but having survived Tailwind and
bested Lou Dobbs, it appears that Kaplan will continue to mold the

   HAIR-MAKEOVER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lisa Fulp was so

three-plus hours to her hometown for a trim. But the Florida heat

   DNA-DADS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ DNA testing is on the rise in
cases of contested paternity. Leon Murray of Wellington was stuck
with child support payments for 10 years before he decided to test
his suspicion that he was not the father of the little girl. Within
two weeks, he got a report from Genetica Labs saying the
probability that he was the father was zero. So a judge dismissed
$25,000 in child support debt owned by Murray, an unemployed
painter. Genetica and dozens of other labs are conducting about
250,000 DNA tests a year, most to settle child support disputes.
They have billboards and websites and Yellow Page listings and the
cost has dropped below $500 for the tests. (Douthat, Palm Beach

potato eyes in what she called her ``best garden ever.'' Then the

tomateos. The strange growth _ ``pomato'' _ puzzled everyone,

mystery. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH PHOTO

   DNA-DADS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ DNA testing is on the rise in
cases of contested paternity. Leon Murray of Wellington was stuck
with child support payments for 10 years before he decided to test
his suspicion that he was not the father of the little girl. Within
two weeks, he got a report from Genetica Labs saying the
probability that he was the father was zero. So a judge dismissed
$25,000 in child support debt owned by Murray, an unemployed
painter. Genetica and dozens of other labs are conducting about
250,000 DNA tests a year, most to settle child support disputes.
They have billboards and websites and Yellow Page listings and the
cost has dropped below $500 for the tests. (Douthat, Palm Beach

KANSAS TAKES A LEAP INTO THE DARK AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Not long after the Kansas Board of Education
voted effectively to ban the teaching of evolution in that state's
public schools, I went to work one day to find a book waiting for
me. It had been delivered by a guy I know _ a bright guy, a nice
guy and a guy with a firmly embedded set of religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   He'd included a note: ``Reading this book is probably the most
intelligent thing you have ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   So I read it. It's a book published by a religious group. The
title: ``Life _ How Did it Get here? By Evolution or by Creation?''
</P>
<P>
   For 250 slickly produced pages, the authors of this book argue
not only that evolution is bunk but that it's pernicious bunk
cooked up to ``serve the purposes of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all a little much for me, frankly. Religious conviction
is a wonderful thing. It offers human beings comfort in times of
trial. It encourages us to behave in civilized ways toward others.
I understand why some people who derive deep, personal satisfaction
from their religious beliefs feel the need to pass along that gift
to others.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, though, I'm getting sick of being beaten over the head
with the religious views of other people. I'm also disturbed at
seeing those religious convictions take on the force of law, as
seems to be happening in Kansas. Once you permit people to write
religious conviction into law, you're only a step away from
confronting some updated version of Tomas de Torquemada or the
Ayatollah Khomeini. Those guys figured they'd cornered the market
on truth, too.
</P>
<P>
   What disturbs me most, though, about this divisive battle
between creationism and evolution is the determination of the
reactionary side to deny others the use of God's most precious gift
to humanity. That's our power to think.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for evidence of a divine spark that
distinguishes our species from all others, you can find it most
vividly in our ability to gather evidence, assess it and to form
conclusions from it. We can do that because we've been granted
unique cognitive skills.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can we solve problems _ the square peg in the square
hole stuff _ but we also have the capacity for abstract or symbolic
thought. That uniquely human ability is what permits you to look
upon the letters on this page, or to hear the sounds that these
letters represent, and to glean from them meaning that's denied
lesser creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The problem I have with creationism is not just the
anti-intellectualism it represents. I object to creationism because
it represents a desperate denial of our most basic human trait.
That's our ability _ our sacred duty, actually _ to draw rational
conclusions about what we see around us.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists are unwilling to accept any view of divine
direction that's not spelled out in a book that many people of
intense religious faith do not take literally. The creationists
simply are unwilling to look upon the vast evidence supporting the
theory of evolution as an indication that we thinking humans have
uncovered clues about one of the mechanisms by which a supreme
being carried out creation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that acceptance of evolution can't be part of a logical
system of devoted religious belief. The polls indicate that, for
most Americans, that's precisely what it is. For some, though, no
religious belief counts except the one they adhere to in each and
every minute detail. Not only are they determined to shove those
beliefs down everybody else's throat eery time the opportunity
presents itself, they believe it's their obligation to do so.
That's what happened in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   And, please, don't kid yourself that it can't happen where you
live.

CALIFORNIA'S GUN LAW MISSES ITS TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You may have heard that the California Assembly
approved a ``junk gun'' ban last week. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   The only junk involved was the legislation itself, which Gov.
Gray Davis has promised to sign. After state Sen. Richard Polanco's
bill passed, Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa said, ``Now we
can say to the people of the state that we've kept our promise to
get rid of cheap and unsafe handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   That's complete bunk.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the bill about the price of handguns. The
safety procedures it specifies will only benefit manufacturers who
want to sell lots of new guns, cheap or expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The bill might also benefit bad guys who want to be assured
their guns won't jam. Boy, do I feel safer now.
</P>
<P>
   Don't just take my word that this bill is junk. The most pro-gun
person and the most anti-gun person in Sacramento both think it's
junk, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Green Party Assemblywoman Audie Bock of Oakland agrees with
National Rifle Association lobbyist Steve Helsley, you know
something weird is going on. They made exactly the same points
about the junkiness of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite amazing, isn't it?'' Bock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go figure,'' Helsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bock and Helsley said the legislation serves the interests
of gun manufacturers because it lets them sell new handguns while
hindering private owners from selling used ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that gun manufacturers didn't oppose this
bill,'' Helsley said. ``Their job is to pump sales. Ours is to
protect rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, even those who make cheap guns, can perform the
complex drop tests and test firings specified in the legislation. A
citizen can't afford the lab testing to sell a used gun. In fact,
there are no labs.
</P>
<P>
   Bock of the Green Party even expressed concern for gun store
owners: ``Legitimate dealers will be stuck with a stock of
expensive used guns they can't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Where do used guns go? Bock and Helsley both said they may end
up on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Cops have an exemption to carry guns deemed unsafe by the
legislation. But if a cop shoots someone with such a gun, a city
will have hell and lawyers to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Both the NRA man and the Green Party woman mentioned this civil
liability issue.
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested that the Assembly has passed an omnibus law of
unintended consequences, Bock said, ``Gun legislation backfires a
lot, pardon the word. This is one of the worst examples.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA man saw some intended non-consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't really want to ban guns,'' Helsley said. ``The
political utility is to do it again and again and again, every time
saying, `Those gun folks have figured a way around our carefully
crafted bills.'''
</P>
<P>
   Helsley, a former assistant director of the state Department of
Justice, said the recently signed assault weapons bill allows
ownership of an AK-47 variant with a new kind of stock, but bans
cowboy-type Winchesters that hold more than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley used assault rifles? Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans vote against every gun-control bill, while
Democrats feel they all have to put in a gun bill of their own,''
Bock said. ``None of them know much about guns. We have a horrible
mish-mash of gun laws that's just impossible for anyone to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich Polanco knows as much about guns as he does particle
physics,'' Helsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so, but maybe politicians are looking out for their
own safety in future elections rather than Californians' safety.
</P>
<P>
   Bock said colleagues warned her that opponents will attack her
for voting against ``junk guns,'' even though she was voting
against junk legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Helsley said, ``The political consultants were circling,
advising their clients, as this bill was on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, Bock and Helsley respect each other, but they don't
agree on anything about guns except that California's gun laws are,
as Bock put it, ``a bunch of baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   Bock ultimately would like to see ``the Japanese model'' of
strictly controlled permits for guns, requirements to keep guns
locked in safes and random checks to see if gun owners are obeying
the laws.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as far from the NRA model as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing both the NRA man and the Green Party woman
mentioned. At the last minute, legislators exempted Glock
semiautomatic pistols, which otherwise wouldn't have met the safety
standards of their ``unsafe handgun'' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just decreed them safe,'' Helsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because a lot of cops like the Glock,'' Bock said.
</P>
<P>
   A Glock is the type of gun a white extremist used to murder a
mail carrier in Los Angeles last week. It's this week's poster gun
for gun control, but somehow the Assembly failed to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters. Nothing in this exercise should make people
feel safer.
</P>

PEWTER, AN OLD ALLOY, ADDS FLAIR TO MODERN DECOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Pewter is one of the oldest known alloys, thought
to have been used as early as 1500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Pewter was commonly made into dishes, drinking vessels, spoons,
bowls and candlesticks in Europe since the Middle Ages. English
pewter was imported to America until its manufacture began here in
the mid-17th century.
</P>
<P>
   It was often a substitute for gold and silver in homes and
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Because pewter is made up of 90 percent tin, it is very soft and
is easily dented. Small amounts of copper and antimony help
strengthen it. Early lower-grade pewter also contained lead in
varying quantities. The lead proved fatal for many who ingested a
dose each time utensils scraped the surface. The lead also caused
tarnish.
</P>
<P>
   The blackish gray patina of pewter varies depending on the
amount of lead. Polished lead-free pewter can look almost as bright
as silver.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece of pewter is cast from a mold, then trimmed, filed
and polished. Shapes were often inspired by simple stylish silver
pieces, such as small trays and tea services. Pewter fell from
favor in the 19th century, when it was replaced by Britannia metal
(a cheaper, lighter non-lead substitute that did not tarnish),
electroplating, china and glassware.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1700s pewter has been made without lead.
</P>
<P>
   With proper care, most pewter will not tarnish or require
polishing. Always hand wash pieces in hot, soapy water soon after
use. (Never put pewter in a dishwasher, because the heat-drying
cycle may darken the surface.) Rinse in clear, hot water and dry
with a soft cloth. Air-drying can leave difficult-to-remove water
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Heat from an oven or burner can melt pewter, so don't use it for
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing usually depends on the amount of copper in a piece and
the overall weight. Candlesticks begin at around $30 for a pair,
drinking vessels at $20 and up, napkin rings for $11 each and an
11-1/2-inch plate for $60 to $75. Antique pieces will cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Most antique pieces are marked by the makers. Most pewter books
list early pewterers and their marks. Antique pewter is popular as
a display collectible today, but many reproduction pieces are
available in museum gift shops and specialty catalogs.

DECORATING FOR CHILDREN MOVES BEYOND DUCKS, BUNNIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Conn., Del., N.J., N.Y.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Children's furnishings are growing up. Bedrooms
are looking more sophisticated, with new lines of furnishings
featuring upholstered chairs, coordinated linens and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   These youthful rooms are more like parts of a studio apartment
with a place to read, work and sleep. Because of computers and CD
players, children are spending more time in their rooms. To that
end, designers have created entertainment centers, workstations,
comfortable upholstered chairs, plush pillows and attractive
accessories to make the rooms as friendly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was fueled by baby boomers now in their 50s, who
became parents in their 30s, according to Cynthia Gray, spokeswoman
for the Home Furnishings Council in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their focus turned away from decorating their children's
bedrooms with cute little duckies and bunnies. They want their
children to have something that is special. They have the income to
spend and desire the same quality for their children's rooms that
they seek in their own bedrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Decorating an attractive and tasteful room helps children learn
about putting a room together, and fosters creativity and pride,
Gray said.``Designing a room with your child when they are young
helps them to understand parameters,'' added Gray. ``It also builds
on the nuclear family concept of a social unit consisting of
parents and their children living under one roof sharing and
creating everything to make their own wonderful nest.''
</P>
<P>
   The home furnishings market is reacting by emulating adult
creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the domestic retail sale of juvenile
furnishings and accessories has increased by 400 percent, totaling
more than $4 billion a year, according to the Juvenile Products
Manufacturers Association in Morristown, N.J. The association added
that sales are expected to increase 4.5 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to spend $150 to $3,000 or more per piece. If you are on
a budget, add a piece at a time. Be sure to select styles that will
grow with the child and look just as fresh from high school to
college and possibly beyond, when there are grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   New catalogs listing the latest in children's furnishings
include e.a. kids, Exposures Homes, Pottery Barn and IKEA.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Allen's e.a. kids line features a cottage-style bedroom
set (starting at $299 for a nightstand and $799 for a twin size
bed) inspired by the rustic beauty of European cottage furniture or
Early American ($1,899 for an armoire) and French provincial styles
(starting at $179 and $239 for a night table).
</P>
<P>
   These latest designs are based on trends and a series of focus
research groups made up of parents.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are made from sturdy maple. Select pieces, such as
desktops, bookshelves and nightstands, feature the laminate top
finish called ``tuff-a-nuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the furnishings are scaled down to child-size,
they are very functional,'' said Jeanne Finning, a designer with
Ethan Allen in Schenectady, N.Y. ``The door chest, which comes in
several styles and finishes, has four drawers, an adjustable shelf,
which can hold sweaters to a CD player, and wiring holes for
electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   She said one of the most versatile pieces is the armoire, which
has a removable rod, adjustable shelves and three tray drawers. It
can be used to store clothes or to house a television and other
electronic equipment. Other scaled-down pieces with a grown-up look
include the petite chaise ($499) that comes in a daisy print
upholstery or ready to be covered with your choice of fabric; the
wing chair ($429), which looks great in a Victorian-style room and
comes with a slipcover for easy cleaning or redecorating; and club
chairs ($699) with matching ottomans ($329).
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Allen's collection for children features everything from
mirrors ($249 to $449) to nightstands and coordinated linens for
the bed. To make shopping easier, all of the furnishings are part
of theme packages. If you are still in doubt, take advantage of
their free design service.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Barn came out in June with its first catalog of
furnishings for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on market research, we saw a void and need to expand in
this area of children's furnishings,'' said Laura Alber, senior
vice president of Pottery Barn Catalog Division. ``It used to be
that only the children's room had children's stuff. Now their
furnishings are incorporated into the rest of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the catalog line has been so successful that the
company is expanding into a Pottery Barn Kids store sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Barn's scaled treasures for kids include an antiqued
armoire ($899), an iron bed reminiscent of a Victorian heirloom
($399 for a twin or $499 for the full size) and a junior version of
the Manhattan club chair ($699 leather, $499 twill) and ottoman
($299 leather, $199 twill).
</P>
<P>
   Exposures Homes catalog offers a charming Newport night table
hand-painted in French blue and white with one drawer and a bottom
shelf ($95). One-of-a-kind designs include a 100 percent chenille
upholstered chair with dust ruffle ($495) and companion ottoman
($195).
</P>
<P>
   Catalog sales will always be a convenience, but as this trend
continues to grow, stores will offer more opportunities to buy in
person.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Hilfiger, wife of fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger,
recently took over a children's shop in Greenwich, Conn., where she
has created a special environment of upscale children's
furnishings, accessories and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Her shop is now called Best &AMP; Co., and her inventory is classic
in design, combining antiques with custom-made furnishings.

MAINE SCHOOL LURES ITS STUDENTS WITH BAIT AND TACKLE

<P>
   FREEPORT, Maine _ ``Did you really go to fly-fishing school?''
</P>
<P>
   We were riding a boat out to a scuba site in Jamaica and my
khaki cap caught the attention of the man across the aisle. The hat
emblem reads: L.L. Bean Fly Fishing School.
</P>
<P>
   I can wear it with honor, as it is my the closest thing to a
diploma for participating in a 3 1/2-hour June casting clinic, part
of Bean's Outdoor Discovery School.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I ever wanted to be a fly fisherman; my experience was
limited to a viewing of ``A River Runs Through It.'' That film
apparently has done more for fly-fishing than you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   Fly-fishing has been part of the Bean business since its
inception in 1912. Instruction ranges from the introductory
courses, such as a one-day workshop where anglers learn the
fundamentals ($175), to a four-day advanced trip to Western Maine
($1,795). In between, there are 2 1/2-hour ($40) advanced
fly-casting clinics and Women's Weekend courses ($300).
</P>
<P>
   There are three things that instructor Sim Savage hopes students
get from an introductory class: a wonderful time, the fundamentals
and that they leave ``tired as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes usually grasp the basics of casting, fly tying, knots
and strategies. The classes have become so popular that Bean has
expanded the introductions. There are 20 fly-fishing instructors on
staff, and all are required to be certified through the Federation
of Fly Fishers.
</P>
<P>
   The typical student is about 45 years old and ``has had a
lifelong dream to learn how to fly-fish,'' says instructor Ellen
Peters, a Master Maine guide and a fly-fisher since the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   The fly rod makes a whooshing sound as it slices through the
air. The yards of line floating off an 8 1/2-foot rod is quite a
sight and I can see the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of us are standing around a long, shallow ``wading pool,''
fly rods at the ready, as we practice over and over the four-part
cast. Tip down to the water, up, forward and tip back in the water.
</P>
<P>
   We learn the backcast and the roll cast, the water droplets hit
the top of the water, and the whoosh-whoosh is the only sound as we
practice over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 percent to 40 percent of participants will continue to
pursue fly-fishing, Savage says. He jokes that attending Bean's
fly-fishing school ``looks good on a corporate resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean's Outdoor Discovery School began in 1979. The school, which
operates year-round, is testament to how Mainers embrace the great
outdoors. Besides fly-fishing, summer classes include wing
shooting, wilderness skills, programs for children, sea kayaking,
canoeing and bicycling. Winter workshops cover cross-country
skiing, snowshoe courses, photography (harp seals and moose,
especially), Maine Guide courses and hiking.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is on-demand programs for day-trippers in
Freeport. If you happen to be in the L.L. Bean store, check out the
list of classes posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about people's recreation time and fun,'' says Mike
Verville, L.L. Bean's director of merchandise. You could say that
L.L. Bean sells both.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a wet suit, spray skirt and water shoes, I looked like a
demented ballerina carrying a pair of oars to the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour sea kayaking class was designed for those who
have some kayak experience, but they let me in, anyway. It was even
fun, once I overcame initial nervousness. And the kayak never
tipped.
</P>
<P>
   Bean uses Sebasco Harbor Resort, a 665-acre estate in the
protected waters of Casco Bay at the mouth of the New Meadows
River, for kayak and canoe workshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to have the same number of people who go out come
back,'' says kayak instructor Bob Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 11 students are from Maine or elsewhere in New
England and have canoe or kayaking experience; then there were the
two of us with no kayaking experience.
</P>
<P>
   We split into two groups and tackled the chilly waters of the
river. We learned how to get into a kayak, the strokes, paddling,
rolls and even how to rescue a kayaker. We paddled out to the mouth
of Casco Bay and then headed back to shore, a little tired and very
proud of our accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   After a rousing game of water bottle keep away, using our hands
instead of oars, we heft kayaks off the beach and trudge back to
the starting point, wash off the mud and hose off the wet suits.
</P>
<P>
   The Outdoor Discovery Schools teach a little bit about Maine's
favorite recreations and a lot about the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fondest wish,'' says Savage, ``is that (visitors) leave
here knowing why clean air and clean water are so important.''

IN FRENZIED WORLD OF ON-LINE AUCTIONS, BUYER BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On-line auctions let you window-shop 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, until you find what you want, without
wearing out your feet or car.
</P>
<P>
   But be aware of the caveats before you start clicking on that
bid box.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass., is a research company that
reviews, ranks and rates e-commerce sites using more than 100
criteria, from ease of use and customer confidence to on-site
resources and relationship services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the consumer's advocate,'' said Hank Hudepohl, an
analyst at Gomez. Even with a watchdog group, each shopper has to
be responsible and follow some basic advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't jump in and buy on impulse,'' Hudepohl said. ``People
can easily get caught up in the fun or competition. It's almost
like gambling. So try to keep your cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommended researching a site and previewing the
merchandise. Watch bidding and see how it goes. Read up on the
rules, which differ from site to site. Most require bidders to be
over 18. And, ``If something seems too good to be true, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are very interested in buying an item, check the bidding
action every hour or so. At eBay.com, for instance, potential
buyers offer as many as 600 bids per minute, according to Kevin
Pursglove, senior director for communications of the on-line
auction house. The site is currently the leading person-to-person
on-line trading community, with more than 1,600 categories and more
than 1.5 billion page visits per month.
</P>
<P>
   Although some on-line auction houses monitor their sites for
strange bidding behavior and unusual listings, the buyer should
still be cautious and savvy before starting to bid, according to
on-line auction specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites let you retract your bid if you accidentally hit the
wrong key or change your mind in a certain time span, while others
allow retracted bids until the last minute of the auction, Hudepohl
said. Know the value of the item you are bidding on and set a limit
for yourself, so you are not caught up paying more than it's worth
or you can afford. Sites like BiddersEdge.com, BidFind.com and
DealTime.com provide a historical record of what was paid for a
type of item at auction, as well as its current auction price and
which auction site has it for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are on-line shopping tips at many of the sites,''
Pursglove said. You can also check into tips produced by Internet
Fraud Watch unit of the National Consumers League based in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The league's Web site is http://www.natlconsumersleague.org/
</P>
<P>
   Know who you are dealing with. On-line auction sites involve
business-to-consumer trading, as with Onsale.com, or
consumer-to-consumer, like eBay and Yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers register with an on-line auction site of their choice
that caters to the type of inventory or item they plan to sell.
They then select how many days the item will be for sale, which can
be anywhere from three days to one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are buying from a business, always look to the area of
their Web site that talks about who they are and how to contact
them,'' Hudepohl advised. ``A site can look very professional and
if you've never heard of it before, you should always verify the
seller.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests checking the feedback forum, where buyers write
their comments about transactions with sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said that even though the main responsibility is with
the seller, the buyer should always do the homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find out how to contact the seller before you start bidding,''
said Pursglove, so you can ask any questions that may not have been
answered on the Web site. You can ask questions while the bidding
is going on, right up until it ends.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said sellers write their own descriptions of the
items. Some include one to three photos, showing different angles,
while others have no photos. Hudepohl said that you should ask if
you can pay by credit card (with most cards, you are only liable
for the first $50 in case of a scam or fraud) and if there is an
escrow service for holding your money until you receive your
merchandise. Never send cash through the mail. Ask about the return
policy and if a high-value item has been or can be certified for
authenticity by a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of shady dealings. Just because 25 people are actively
bidding on an item doesn't mean it's valuable. It could be an
instance of collusion between sellers and false bidders who are
trying to increase the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Some bidders engage in sniping, timing their first bid for the
very last second to beat out all other people. At times, auction
companies will extend the bidding by an hour or more if they expect
that this is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bid shielding is an unethical practice of trying to block others
from bidding. Here's how it works: One person bids $10 for a book
and a colleague quickly bids $500, assuming that no one will
overbid the inflated price. The high bidder retracts the bid at the
last minute, giving the first person a $10 deal.
</P>
<P>
   On-line auctions should be fun when they are conducted right and
if buyers are honest, Pursglove said. ``There's a great sense of
community when partaking in an on-line auction, where you can chat
with other people who have the same interests as you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudepohl also said to have fun, but as with anything, continue
to always be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to product selection, there's almost an
unlimited potential for finding what you need,'' Hudepohl
said.``It's important to know that only the top 50 (sites) have 95
percent of the market. Many sites are just trying to get their feet
off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudepohl said merchandisers market and liquidate their products
much more efficiently in auctions.
</P>
<P>
   With 500 auction sites on the World Wide Web, there's something
for every interest. Even the venerable Sotheby's auction house went
on line this summer. Matthew Weigman, director of Sotheby's press
office in New York, said that the auction house is also in a new
joint on-line auction site with Amazon.com, best known as a book
retailer. This fall, Sothebys.amazon.com will offer memorabilia
from Secretariat, America's most beloved Triple Crown winner, and
baseball memorabilia.

INDIANOLA NEAR-EXTINCT, ITS PAST LOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANOLA, Texas _ Here along Matagorda Bay, between Port Lavaca
and Port O'Connor, lies a lonesome stretch of beach marked by a
makeshift barrier of broken concrete slabs, and long, decaying
piers that tumble into the brackish water.
</P>
<P>
   The lone, reclusive figure along these vacant shores is a large,
pink-granite statue of Rene Robert Cavellier, Sieur de La Salle,
the French explorer who first set foot here more than 300 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few fishing cabins across the road from the beach.
The official tally for Indianola is supposed to be 100 people, but
it would take a generous count on a busy day to get half that many.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable historical marker near a small group of covered picnic
tables goes largely unread. Indianola has been forgotten in Texas
history. Even now, with the dying fury of Hurricane Bret holding
the public's attention, this tiny town is never mentioned. It is
not known.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more than 100 years ago, Indianola was considered the
second-largest seaport in Texas. Second to Galveston. Hurricanes
blew it off the map, destroyed it twice and returned it to native
sand and rock. They all but erased its place in the development of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels picked this point of Matagorda
Bay as the landing port for thousands of German immigrants who
eventually populated the whole of Texas, particularly the Hill
Country.
</P>
<P>
   The port was called Indian Point for a while and it became a
deep-water port during the Mexican War. For 30 years it was the
primary Army depot supplying the frontier forts of western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was through this port that the Army brought its first Camel
Corps, a herd of camels purchased as an experiment ordered by
Secretary of War Jefferson Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The town was established in 1847. Stagecoach service to the
interior of the state began the next year. By 1848, the name was
officially changed to Indianola. It became the county seat of
Calhoun County and was the primary port through which European
immigrants flowed into western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Union gunboats bombarded the city on Oct. 26, 1862. Troops
eventually occupied the town, then looted it. They left the
following month but returned nearly a year later and stayed until
1864.
</P>
<P>
   The Handbook of Texas says the ``first shipment of mechanically
refrigerated beef moved from Indianola to New Orleans on the
steamship Agnes in July 1869.''
</P>
<P>
   It is said that warehouses stored ice at Indianola. The ice was
cut on the Great Lakes and shipped south at great expense. The ice
was prized during the Texas summers.
</P>
<P>
   Indianola was at her peak _ between 5,000 and 6,000 residents _
in 1875 when the first hurricane struck. The town was crammed with
visitors attending an important trial. Two days later, about 300
people had died.
</P>
<P>
   The town was rebuilt. But on Aug. 19, 1886, a second hurricane
hit. This one was accompanied by a huge fire and the town was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Those residents who did survive had no heart to rebuild again.
The county seat was moved to Port Lavaca and the memories of
Indianola were allowed to wash away with the debris.

DIVORCE INSPIRED PHIL COLLINS' SONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've heard many versions of the story behind the Phil Collins
song ``In the Air Tonight.'' In each, Phil witnesses a drowning or
a murder. Is there any truth to any story related to this song?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.M., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The only troubling event Collins used as inspiration for the
song was the breakup of his first marriage. Collins and Andrea
Brett divorced in 1978, and she raised their children, Joely and
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Collins told Parade that the song was written out of
frustration and bitterness after the split. ``You're putting your
private life out for all to see,'' Collins said. ``But I'm not
embarrassed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   More of his private life was on display in 1994, when People
reported that Collins sent a fax telling second wife, Jill
Tavelman, he wanted a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Collins wrote five songs on the ``Tarzan'' soundtrack and, with
his big band, has a new album, ``A Hot Night in Paris.'' On July
23, he married his former interpreter, Orianne Cevey, in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the significance of the lapel pin that Robert McCall
wore on the ``Equalizer'' TV series?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.C., Midland, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A: The lapel pin never figured into a story during the show's
four-year run.
</P>
<P>
   The pin was added to McCall's wardrobe by costume designer Linda
Wayne, according to a frequently asked questions list prepared by
``Equalizer'' fans. The list appears on the Web site
www.conubic.com/eqew/eq-ew/eq.html.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as an artist has their signature on their work of art, a
costume designer also has a signature when they are working on
something like a TV series,'' according to the site. ``When she
left the series in the fourth season, the pin went with her and was
never seen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Series star Edward Woodward, who played McCall, said in a TV
interview he always figured the lapel pin would be used in an
episode ``as a weapon or something important to the story,''
according to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a hot sauce that I would like to get to the
marketplace. What is the best way to market a recipe or the sauce
itself?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.I., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: One place to start looking is the International Chili
Society, a 32-year-old group that runs the World's Salsa
Championship each year.
</P>
<P>
   The society, which was founded with the 1967 World Champion
Chili Cookoff in Terlingua, Texas, sanctions chili contests around
the world. An estimated 300 cookoffs were held in 1998 for 1
million cooks, judges and tasters.
</P>
<P>
   Society members, who call themselves ``chiliheads,'' receive a
quarterly newspaper with 60 pages of chili-related news, recipes
and photos.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (877) 777-4427 or write to the
International Chili Society, 6755 Speedway Blvd., Las Vegas, NV
89115. The society has a Web site at www.chilicookoff.com.

MOM WON'T EASILY GIVE UP SON'S FRIENDSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know the difference between a hat trick and a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   I know the difference between a nine-iron and a sand wedge _
even though I'm terrible with a sand wedge. This spring, I used one
to dig holes for my flower bed. I just put a practice ball on the
spot where I wanted to plant the bulb and pretended I was in a sand
trap. I never did hit that ball, but my petunias were gorgeous.
And, yes, I know the difference between a Mustang and a Corvette.
These are simple matters.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the difference between, ``Mom, you don't have to
come,'' and ``Mom, you don't need to come?''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch! That still hurts. Give me a moment please, OK? I'll be all
right. I really don't believe that my son meant to bruise my
feelings. He's a sweet man-boy. And, frankly, the singular idea of
spending another two hours of my life on the sideline of some
mom-forsaken field as fire rains from the sky, is not appealing. It
never was, really.
</P>
<P>
   I've done it time after time, field after field, bleacher after
bleacher, for years, however. I've lugged the coolers, yelled out
encouragement for the wrong mascot, and purchased thousands of
losing raffle tickets. And why have I been such a devoted, rabid
fan for so many teams? Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because of my son. Where he went, I went.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I sat on the sidelines of practice balancing my checkbook,
making phone calls and reading novels. Yes, I've spent the entire
halftime of soccer games in the women's restroom trying to escape
the merciless heat or Arctic cold. But when the team was in motion,
whenever my son moved, even if he was just scratching himself, I
saw it. It was recorded in my mind for all time. I battled entire
battalions of mosquitoes for my boy just because he asked, ``Mom,
you're coming to my game aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   He said it like a sentence, though, like he expected me there
because he wanted me there. He needed me. So, as often as I could,
through headaches and heartaches, I went to his games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, he says, ``Mom, you don't need to come to
practice anymore.'' To soften the blow, he added that none of the
other moms come. Oh, so now it's a Dad thing. Dad can come, but I'm
not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   I'm cool. I don't wear goofy clothes or yell, ``Hit him again!''
at basketball games. I don't run on the field and do cartwheels
with the cheerleaders _ anymore. What happened? Why was I banished?
</P>
<P>
   I think it's this awful robber who keeps coming to e at
night. I used to call him the man fairy, but fairies are nice
people. They bring you cute little things like tooth money and
tiaras. This guy is a thief. First he took my son's fat baby cheeks
away. Then he stole his giggles and hugs. This summer he ferreted
away his little boy voice and left a voice box that rumbles like
thunder and sounds like my husband. Those things I expected. I was
sort of prepared for those losses.
</P>
<P>
   But I never dreamed he'd steal my son's desire for my company.
Gee whiz. That's been the hardest loss of all.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm fighting back. The thief can have my baby's adolescence.
The girls can even have his attention. But his friendship, our
friendship, is priceless. No one is taking our relationship away
without going through me first, and I just ain't having it! Not
today, not tomorrow, not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, I went to practice anyway. There were several
other moms there. I think my son even looked my way once, and
smiled. Later, he didn't complain, but he did say, ``Mom, when you
come to practice again, will you bring me some Gatorade?''
</P>

F. SCOTT FITZGERALD UNDERSTOOD MODERN AMERICAN LONGINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I keep coming back to the Modern Library board's selection of
the 100 best novels in English published in this century. I've
given recent reports on some of these ``best'' novels, and others
may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Today's focus is on F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``Tender Is the
Night'' _ which, if you've already read it, you may care to read
again, especially if you have a more than passing interest in its
author.
</P>
<P>
   The late Ken Millar, whose Lew Archer melodramas were bylined
``Ross Macdonald,'' once told me he rated Scott Fitzgerald as
America's greatest author of the 20th century for being ``the first
one to grasp the modern American experience.'' I've sifted that one
around, striving to understand, and perhaps I'm getting close.
</P>
<P>
   The modern American experience is love. It may be said as simply
as that, but love is never simple. In earlier centuries and in
other places, love was necessarily subordinated to more practical
considerations, but 20th-century America held more options _ and
love in all its considerations and forms became an ever more
powerful motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Fitzgerald wrote about these confusions in his own quest
for answers. Love isn't sex, but love without sex isn't love, and
one must fire the other. This theme is addressed in scores of
Fitzgerald short stories and in three of his four completed novels
_ ``The Beautiful and Damned,'' ``The Great Gatsby'' and ``Tender
Is the Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Side of Paradise,'' the novel that introduced the
24-year-old Fitzgerald in 1920, exists apart. It is a precocious
performance, but is essentially an invention that does not connect
to its author's own experience. ``The Beautiful and Damned'' does,
but it has never been held in high critical regard. ``Gatsby,''
though, has been in favor since its 1925 publication, its
reputation riding steadily upward until it placed second, right
behind James Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' in the Modern Library election.
</P>
<P>
   Its three principal male figures _ Jay Gatsby, Nick Carroway and
Tom Buchanan _ all reveal aspects of Fitzgerald's personality and
philosophy. But protagonist Dick Diver in ``Tender Is the Night''
is Fitzgerald absolutely, although Diver is presented as a
psychiatrist rather than as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Composing the novel was a necessary catharsis for ``Diver.'' The
wealthy, schizophrenic Nicole Warren, whom he treats and with whom
he falls in love and marries, is a paraphrase of Zelda Sayre
Fitzgerald, whose mental instability was impressed upon her husband
when their marriage was fresh. Rosemary Hart, the young actress who
lures Diver into an extramarital affair, is Fitzgerald's literary
stand-in for Lois Moran, a Hollywood beauty of the period.
</P>
<P>
   That period, of course, is the Jazz Age 1920s, Fitzgerald's own
preserve. Although ``Tender Is the Night'' was not published until
1934, and sold poorly as late issue of a has-been author, it was
written on and off between 1925 and 1931 as Zelda's mental
condition worsened. Not until 1948, when a new edition was
introduced with Malcolm Cowley's commentary, was it clarified that
the novel was an ironic presentation of a true-life drama.
</P>
<P>
   The innately romantic Scott Fitzgerald was completely absorbed
in and dominated by his love for Zelda, and his failure to save her
was his awful defeat. He sensed Zelda would be his undoing, as
Nicole, whom he substantially cures, is the ruination of fictional
Dick Diver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tender Is the Night'' is tragedy of high literary order. It is
now available in several paperback editions as well as the Modern
Library hardback; and, along with ``Gatsby,'' it endures on library
shelves.

WHO'S CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No amount of ginkgo biloba will bring back the brain cells of my
youth. No catchy rap song will help me remember more than one of
the Pokemon monsters' names (Go, Pikachu!). Not even 10 hours of
sleep will keep me from bringing home stacks of Lean Cuisines
identical to the ones in the freezer while I forget the item that
prompted my urgent trip to the store.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of an aging intellect have come slowly but
comfortably, and I thought I was OK with time's march on my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Until last weekend, when I found myself turning into my dad.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday began like any other weekend morning. Innocent. Sweet.
With my two kids snuggled against each side of me, still heavy with
sleep, I reached for the remote control for the TV. And found it
caked with dried milk.
</P>
<P>
   The buttons were ringed with thick lines of white. A light film
covered the whole gadget. I pressed one of the buttons. It went
down. And stayed down.
</P>
<P>
   Frantically, I began pushing all the buttons. Fast forward for
the VCR. Rewind. Channel up. Power. They all stuck. Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the TV didn't work either. Somehow, when the remote
went out, it turned off whatever it is that makes the VCR work,
which is what our cable box runs through, which means, in brief,
that suddenly we could only get Channel 3. Well, I like Pokemon at
3 p.m. as much as the next person (again, Go Pikachu!), but I like
``Ally'' on Fox, too, and this was our brand-new VCR and in the
split second that I took to think this whole thing through
carefully before I opened up my mouth, the most reasonable idea in
my head was Scream.
</P>
<P>
   Which I did, and as best I recall it was some incoherent
combination of how We Need to Take Care of Our Things, and What Do
You Think I Am, Made of Money?, two of my most tried-and-tired
refrains.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, neither of my children stepped forward at this
point to take credit for the milk spill I was so elaborately crying
over. Since Scream wasn't working as a parenting strategy, I sat
down on the hamper and took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's figure out what to do,'' I seethed, trying now to
demonstrate problem-solving for my impressionable progeny.
Five-year-old Hadley giggled.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later I was at Best Buy with my milky remote, searching
for a replacement universal remote that looked similar. None of
them did, so 45 minutes later I selected one that fit in my price
range instead: $19.79, including batteries and tax. I went to the
office to catch up on some work, and promptly forgot about the
remote mess.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday began like any other weekend morning. Innocent. Sweet. I
installed the batteries in the universal, and followed the
directions. The remote worked. The volume button worked. Hey, it
never had with the other remote! I was a genius.
</P>
<P>
   I was an idiot. There was no button to change the Line In, which
meant no PlayStation capabilities. No Medieval or Croc. There was
no button to initiate programming for the VCR. No taped episodes of
``Ally.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperation led to an idea. I got out a Q-Tip and starting
cleaning the milky remote. Some of the buttons were working now.
The Line In worked. The programming worked. But the volume still
didn't work _ and neither did the fast-forward or rewind.
</P>
<P>
   And this is when I developed my System, and turned into my dad.
Why not have two remotes for several different purposes (OK,
technically three remotes; the original one for the TV _ the one
that the batteries fall out of every time you pick it up _ was
still the only one that could turn the 10-year-old set on and off)?
</P>
<P>
   My System worked, and the only possible drawback would be my own
death, in which case no one on the planet would be able to figure
the System out.
</P>
<P>
   That if-I-go, it-goes-with me System is exactly how my dad has
set up his own VCRs, including the one that has the illegible
handwritten instructions that he keeps in a drawer and has to drag
out every December when we all want to watch White Christmas again.
Every year he screams and seethes. And every year we giggle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, I have a feeling I won't be laughing. Because
now, you know, I have become my dad, who I realize is a true
Problem-Solving Genius. So I'll be the one taking notes.
</P>

MORE AUTO BUYERS LET THEIR FINGERS DO THE BUYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet is bringing change to two more old
world practices, the kicking of tires on the auto lot and the test
drive.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 5 million new vehicle buyers will use the
Internet to gather information to help them decide what vehicles to
purchase, and as many as 5 percent of auto purchases are expected
to be made on line by 2000, a new survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealers have not only recognized the potential of sales via
the on-line buying services that connect them to consumers, but
have established their own presences on the World Wide Web to sell
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where it's going,'' said Tom O'Leary, general manager of
Burlingame Ford in Burlingame, where a manager works full-time on
Internet sales. ``It's the computer age. Computers in this area are
as common as telephones.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of new vehicle shoppers using the Internet
increased from 25 percent in 1998 to 40 percent during the first
quarter of 1999 and is projected to be 65 percent by the end of
2000, according to a survey by J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power, based in suburban Los Angeles, is an international
marketing information firm that covers automobiles, tires,
airlines, health care, phone services and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   One popular site is Kelly Blue Book (www.kbb.com), the on-line
version of the venerable publication that began as a service
strictly for used car buyers, but which now carries information on
new models as well.
</P>
<P>
   Other on-line services take consumers some or all of the way
through the buying process.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Autoweb.com of Santa Clara, one of the pioneers
of the sector in 1995, consumers can find information on every make
and model of passenger vehicle made and a network of dealers in 50
states through which they can begin a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a process that used to take a few weeks _ getting
information about a car, driving around looking at cars, test
driving them _ and now in a couple hours you can get all the
information you need,'' said Dean DeBiase, the president and chief
executive of Autoweb.com. ``You can either schedule a test drive
or, quite frankly, just buy the car on line.''
</P>
<P>
   He said perhaps 40 percent of consumers who are using his
service may eschew the test drive because they are familiar with
the brand they are buying.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Denove, director of consulting operations at J.D. Power,
said the number of people buying a new vehicle through the Internet
rose from 12,000 per month in the first three months of 1998 to
nearly 30,000 per month in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a growing, but still tiny, sector of overall auto sales.
About 13 million people buy a new car each year, Denove said.
Another 3 million new vehicles are purchased annually by
governments or large businesses for their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers that have relationships with on-line buying services
like Autoweb.com generally offer consumers firm prices, which the
industry says are competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these are better prices than the best negotiator can
get walking in through the front door and dealing with the
salesperson directly,'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   He said consumers are becoming more informed and that dealers
and auto manufacturers ``have to find ways of doing business with
an informed consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Denove said the growing influence of the Internet is likely to
hit domestic manufacturers the hardest. The J.D. Power study shows
that the more time a person spends on line, the less likely he or
she is to purchase a domestic vehicle. Overall, domestic
manufacturers have approximately 70 percent of the share of the
market share; however, this share drops to 58 percent among
Internet shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Autoweb.com, other major on-line services include
Irvine-based autobytel.com; carpoint.msn.com, a service of
Microsoft; and cars.com of Chicago.

 CLEVELAND: ... third and 1.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might have been mistaken for group dementia under the searing
sun. But a visit to the Dawg Pound revealed the true motives of the
crowd _ or ``guests,'' as they are termed in the new Browns'
parlance. In the new stadium, the Pound has been not only preserved
but expanded, from 5,000 to 10,000 seats spanning two decks, and
after three years of silence, its denizens were eager to woof. Some
had left work at 2 o'clock to be ready once the gates opened at
3:30, an hour and a half before the practice, and Aaron Eck, a
four-year Pound veteran _ or inmate _ explained why.
</P>
<P>
   Eck, a 28-year-old heavy-equipment operator, had been forced to
content himself with rooting against Modell's new team, the
Baltimore Ravens, ever since the owner pulled up stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to kill Modell; I hated him,'' said Eck, echoing a
popular sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Now he had something to root for, even if it was just pretend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited three years, and I don't care how I see 'em,'' said
Eck, hoisting his souvenir beer. ``If they're gonna be here, I'm
gonna be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns actually had been on initial display two weeks before
in the Hall of Fame exhibition game at Canton, a 20-17 victory over
the Dallas Cowboys, and those Clevelanders who didn't form part of
the record crowd of 25,156 at the game had welcomed back the team
on television.
</P>
<P>
   This presented a scheduling conflict for some, such as Dawg
Pounder Ed McCluskey III, a 26-year-old Ford Motor Company driver
from Sandusky. The game ran simultaneously with the wake for his
father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the first hour at the funeral home,'' said
McCluskey. ``No way was I going to miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clevelanders had been missing pro football something awful since
not long after the day Modell dropped his bombshell. Having cried
poor-mouth for a while, he waited to make his announcement until
the eve of a November election in which funds were approved to
subsidize the renovation of Cleveland Stadium he had sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like finding out that your best friend was terminally
ill,'' said John ``Big Dawg'' Thompson, a 38-year-old computer
parts salesman who founded the Dawg Pound 14 years ago and served
as its full-scale poster boy, wearing a $10 rubber hound dog mask,
a No. 98 Browns jersey, and white replica team pants with
orange-and-brown piping down the sides over his 375-pound frame
each game day. ``Then you find out you only have four chances to
visit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those represented the Browns' final four home games, and when
the death knell sounded the week before Christmas in a 26-10
victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, the atmosphere was one of
mourning and menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't so much sadness for the players as for the
city,'' recalled Langham. ``It's tough to explain why you're moving
a team after a city and fans have supported you so well.''
</P>
<P>
   These fans had no interest in explanations. They expressed their
affection for Modell as the game wound down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered why people were standing through the fourth
quarter,'' said McCluskey, who didn't belong to the Dawg Pound at
the time but had obtained tickets for the game. ``Then I turned
around and saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacksaws were what he saw. Two of them were being used to carve
up the bleachers; one was confiscated, but security guards finally
gave up and the other remained in use. And in the higher-priced
sections, industrial tools were deployed to unbolt entire rows of
chairback seats. Some fans kept them as mementos; others bequeathed
them as a sort of bon voyage present for Modell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started about five rows behind me,'' said Eck. ``People
were passing down rows of seats to the front and throwing them onto
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   What remained on the field, really, was Cleveland's heart and
soul. The players', likewise. At the end of the game, the Browns
took a farewell lap around the stadium to shake hands with their
former patrons. Many shed tears, fans and players alike.
</P>
<P>
   But the surrender was temporary. The next morning, Thompson
awakened from the nightmare and said to himself, ``The hell with
it. We're going to let the league know they can't get away with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mayor's office, White was of a similar mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were finally convinced that we were heading down the
primrose path,'' he said, ``I went to New York with my attorney and
told the commissioner we weren't going to take this lying down. We
had done everything right, including giving Modell the choice of a
new stadium or renovation _ he chose renovation. I said to the
commissioner, `We're not going to let Art Modell kick us in the
teeth and put our tail between our legs and go home. There's going
to be a fight, and there's going to be blood on the floor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of paper, too. While White handled the political
football, Thompson galvanized the populace. The grassroots
groundswell proved overwhelming. Rallies were organized. Faxes
flooded the NFL offices. The group known as Save Our Browns _ its
pointed acronym SOB _ staged phone-ins, sent blizzards of postcards
to each NFL team, and jammed the Internet with e-mail pleas to
relocated club boosters around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a call from some college, either North Carolina or
North Carolina State,'' recalled Thompson. ``They said, `Who are
these Cleveland Browns to be shutting down the Internet? We're
trying to conduct classes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns diehards were busy teaching the NFL a lesson. It
culminated with a pilgrimage to the owners' meetings in Atlanta,
where Thompson and four busloads of fellow preservationists
delivered a massive scroll with 2.2 million signatures demanding
satisfaction for Cleveland. Thompson, initially banned from the
hotel where the owners were meeting, eventually gained entry and
buttonholed ``15 or 16 of them'' to make his case. White worked
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans' role was huge,'' said Policy, who at the time was
running the San Francisco 49ers and serving on the NFL's Finance
Committee. ``You had a tandem situation. Community leadership on
the one hand _ Mayor White and an extremely potent business
community in the form of Cleveland Tomorrow. On the other hand, you
had a huge, passionate fan campaign that did some things that are
historical footnotes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason the Browns aren't one. Soon after the Atlanta
avalanche, the landmark deal was struck in which Modell was allowed
to leave while the Browns, in spirit and fact, remained, though
they were put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the new stadium was built, and last Sept. 8, an
expansion franchise was awarded to local financier and
philanthropist Alfred Lerner, who had loaned his private jet to his
friend Modell to fly to Baltimore and seal the relocation pact some
three years earlier.

   There are no hard feelings toward Lerner; there never were any
against the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really blamed the Browns,'' said veteran linebacker
Chris Spielman, an Ohio native. ``They think one person was to
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   With that person gone, the support for the new Browns is
unprecedented. For the first time, every home game, exhibition and
regular-season, is a sellout. There were 4,000 fans in Canton for
the expansion draft. Dawg Pound tickets, priced at $30, are in
demand for some $300 among people who want to do it up right for
the regular-season opener. Businesses are jostling one another to
get on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different; we're a major league city now,'' said
Dennis Roche, general manager of Cleveland's Chamber of Commerce.
``Corporately, people want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that boosterism comes a heightened sense of responsibility.
The Browns are an expansion team _ as evidenced by a 30-3 humbling
by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in their second exhibition _ but they
aim to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of not wanting to disappoint people who have been
there 1,000 percent for you,'' said Policy, a Youngstown native who
returned home as a 10 percent equity partner in the Browns. ``It's
almost like you feel an obligation to them.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the mere return of the Browns is dividend enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I wouldn't spend four or five hours of my afternoon
down here just to watch them scrimmage,'' said Eck from his Dawg
Pound perch Tuesday. ``But I want to see anything of them I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Woof, woof.

COSTAS PLAYS SOME HARDBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Costas brought his A-game for an interview with Pete Rose
that aired Monday on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Costas gave a clinic on how to ask tough questions without being
mean-spirited or condescending. He never let Rose get away with
giving cute or nonresponsive answers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, of course, is whether Rose bet on baseball games.
Despite his denials, Rose was banned from the game by former
commissioner Bart Giamatti and has since applied for reinstatement.
Current commissioner Bud Selig appears reluctant to let Rose back
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose Bud Selig grants you a hearing . . .,'' Costas asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I would say to him?'' Rose answered. `` `Bud,
please, can I see the evidence? I want to see the evidence. I want
to comment on the evidence.' That's what I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You contest the evidence?'' Costas asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I would,'' Rose answered. ``Sure I would. Sure I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas went right after the evidence question.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that there are betting slips,'' Costas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they at?'' Rose asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there are phone records, including multiple phone calls
on several dates spread over at least a couple of years, an hour or
less before game time, into the manager's office . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Rose answered. ``That's not true. That's
not true at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your handwriting on a betting slip, including baseball
games,'' Costas said. ``Never against the Reds, but on the Reds and
on other baseball games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Rose answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they've got all that,'' Costas went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they . . . well, can I see it, please?'' Rose answered.
``Can you see it? Can America see it? I mean, don't you think that
baseball would come forward with that? They come forward with
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You deny that you ever bet on baseball?'' Costas asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to answer that question because I'm going to
live up to the agreement I signed,'' said Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Costas explained to ``Today'' host Matt Lauer that gambling is a
capital crime in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball makes a valid distinction between gambling and other
transgressions or character flaws that might be as bad or worse
outside the context of sports,'' Costas explained. ``But in sports,
gambling is in a separate category because it goes to the question
of the integrity of the contest or the perception of the integrity
of the contest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Football beats baseball
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CNN/SI analyst Ron Meyer had mostly praise for the Patriots,
stating that they looked to be on a par with the other teams in the
NFL's toughest division. ``The Patriots looked very impressive,''
the former New England coach said. ``(Drew) Bledsoe played
extremely well and had a nice array of receivers. But the question
remains, will the Patriots be able to fill the void created by
Robert Edwards's injury?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Writes and wrongs
</P>
<P>
   Nick Charles blasted the hypocrisy of professional athletes
charging fans for autographs on CNN/SI's ``Page One.'' ``The
relationship between athlete and fan has been altered forever,
because sports stars are paid handsomely to appear at collectors
conventions and even more just to sign,'' Charles said. ``Celtics
great Bill Russell refused to sign autographs during his playing
and coaching days and once wrote that signing his name would rob
him of his own freedom. Now he'll sign your basketball for $350.''
. . . CNN/SI's Fred Hickman appeared on ABC's ``Politically
Incorrect'' last week and joined the growing chorus of opposition
to professional wrestling. ``When I was a kid, we looked up to and
followed sports heroes like Willie Mays,'' Hickman said. ``Now kids
are following pro wrestling and characters like `Wifebeater.' I am
a firm believer in if you follow something you soon will act or
model yourself after it. In this case, these kids are going to slip
through the cracks and into trouble. Hey, buy yourself a deck of
cards and stay away from wrestling.'' . . . Former Reds pitcher Rob
Dibble gave Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette a little spanking
last week on ESPN Radio. Dibble said that star players such as
Pedro Martinez deserve a little slack and should not be treated
like regular players. ``Dan Duquette, No. 1, is a scared weasel,''
Dibble said Friday morning. ``He is such a chicken guy that he
delegates other people to do his dirty work. Now Jimy Williams is
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another one on board
</P>
<P>
   There's always room for more NFL analysis on television. Mike
Francesa joins the pack this season with ``The NFL Now,'' debuting
Sept. 12 on MSNBC, essentially a televised version of his radio
show. It will be simulcast from the WFAN radio studios in Astoria,
N.Y., though only the first hour of the two-hour nationally
syndicated show will be picked up on TV . . . ``SportsCenter''
anchor Dan Patrick debuts a show Sept. 13 on ESPN Radio. It will
include the standard fare of celebrity interviews and appearances
by ESPN commentators. ``I love radio, especially the
free-to-express-ideas format that drives ESPN Radio,'' Patrick told
reporters. ``Now, instead of doing bite-sized portions of sports, I
will be able to take a little bigger bite each day, have some fun,
and express my opinions and feelings.''

MILAN WILL FACE CHALLENGES AS SERIE A KICKS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Italy's Serie A season begins Sunday with defending champion
Milan in crisis. Club president Silvio Berlusconi criticized coach
Alberto Zaccheroni's ``tridente'' attack of Oliver Bierhoff, Andriy
Shevchenko, and George Weah after a 2-1 loss to Parma for the
Italian Super Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Zvonimir Boban suffered an abdominal injury while playing for
Croatia against Malta, Brazilian midfielder Leonardo is struggling,
and Weah has returned to his Staten Island home on ``personal
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milan, which opens the season at Lecce, overcame bigger
problems last season. And Zaccheroni deservedly received much of
the credit after returing Weah to an advanced position alongside
Bierhoff.
</P>
<P>
   This week will be a high-stakes antipasto to the season.
Juventus meets Rennes of France in the Intertoto Cup final Tuesday;
Fiorentina visits Widzew Lodz and Parma plays host to Rangers in
the Champions League preliminaries Wednesday; and Lazio meets
Manchester United for the European Super Cup in Monte Carlo Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers appears primed to upset Parma _ revenge for last year's
elimination. Parma clearly underestimated Rangers in falling, 2-0,
in the away leg in Glasgow two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pounded another Scottish opponent, Dundee United, by a
score of 4-1 Saturday as Michael Mols and Claudio Reyna continued
to impress. Mols, though, is awaiting the birth of his first child
and could miss the match in Parma. Rangers president David Murray
will make his private jet available for Mols, but Rangers Dutch
coach Dick Advocaat said he is certain the birth will not occur
until next week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid shakeup
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz spent $82 million in the
offseason to reinforce the team, nearly half of that to acquire
Nicholas Anelka from Arsenal. But Real Madrid needed two holdovers,
Fernando Morientes and Raul, to score in the 92d and 93d minutes of
a 2-1 victory over Mallorca in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh coach John Toshack is expected to revive Real Madrid with
a ``dream team'' lineup, but he has been under extreme pressure
while awaiting the arrival of Anelka and feuding with Dutch
midfielder Clarence Seedorf. But in the opening game, Toshack
boldly removed Anelka late in the second half, and Real Madrid
rallied. And Monday, Sanz said Seedorf would be sold to Inter.
There is a dispute over the price, though, as Sanz wants nearly $30
million and Inter's Massimo Moratti has offered about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always known very well that I could be finished with
Real at any moment,'' Toshack said. ``It could fall apart in five
minutes, five months, or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barcelona is remaining relatively tranquil with the
addition of another former Ajax player, Finnish midfielder Jari
Litmanen. Barcelona lost to Valencia in the Spanish Super Cup but
appears to have adjusted to the 3-4-3 alignment of coach Louis Van
Gaal.
</P>
<P>
   And Atletico Madrid, eternally ambitious under the questionable
direction of Jesus Gil y Gil, suffered a 2-0 loss to city rival
Rayo Vallecano before a capacity home crowd at Estadio Vicente
Calderon. US national team goalkeeper Kasey Keller made his Liga
debut for Rayo Vallecano and performed well, though he apparently
was fortunate that Atletico missed an open goal with the score 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earning their keep
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara had a fast start in its first season in Portugal's
Primera. The Azoreans, the first club from the islands to win
promotion to the top division, held a 2-0 halftime lead over
Sporting on goals by Gamboa. A capacity crowd of 18,000 attended
the match at Estadio de Sao Miguel, nearly equaling the population
of Ponta Delgada, listed at 21,000. This was also a special
achievement for coach Manuel Fernandes, who played for Sporting and
Portugal's national team, and a shock for Sporting under Italian
coach Giuseppe Materazzi and with former Manchester United
goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel making his debut.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Profitable farm crop
</P>
<P>
   Television rights to the Brazilian championship have been sold
for $120 million this year, with $50 million in foreign contracts.
These are significant figures for an entity with many minor league
traits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 Brazilians are performing outside the country,
many with top clubs in Europe, which still exhibits a colonial
mentality about South American soccer. Brazil is considered a vast
farm system to supply a gigantic industrial machine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the soccer industry's estimated worth is more than $260
billion, and 80 percent of that value is European. With that
financial advantage, European clubs are going to be predominant.
But when it comes to quality of play, South America more than holds
its own: Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay have won half of the 16
World Cups contested.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Brasilerao'' season, which began last month, involves 22
clubs and more than 500 players. A few are foreigners, most notably
Colombians Victor Hugo Aristizabal (Santos), Faustino Asprilla
(Palmeiras), and Freddie Rincon (Corinthians), and Paraguayan
Francisco Arce (Palmeiras).
</P>
<P>
   Though the national championship is billing itself as ``The Best
Championship in the World,'' and it produces a Copa Libertadores
entrant, the state championships are equally significant. The state
of Sao Paulo, for instance, has about the same population as
Argentina (30 million) and a greater economy. This illustrates the
scope of Brazil, and gives an idea of its human resources and its
sporting system's ability to produce top-level athletes, despite
the historic instability of economy and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Corinthians has emerged as the top team in San Paulo and the
Brasilerao, with seven national team players, including the
unpredictable Edilson, barred from the Selecao after igniting a
brawl when he began mocking Palmeiras's tactics by stopping to
perform a juggling act in the middle of the second half of the
state final.
</P>
<P>
   Wanderley Luxemburgo, coach of the Selecao, is doing a juggling
act of his own to prepare for friendly matches against Argentina
Sept. 4 in Buenos Aires and Sept. 7 in Porto Alegre. He has called
in both Ronaldo from Inter and Ronaldinho Assis, the latest
19-year-old sensation, from Gremio; Rivaldo from Barcelona, Roberto
Carlos from Real Madrid, and Juninho, who was dropped by Atletico
Madrid and is with Vasco da Gama; plus three Roma players, Cafu,
Antonio Carlos Zago, and Marcos Assuncao.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Argentina did not recall Gabriel Batistuta, who is
questionable for Fiorentina's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still in power
</P>
<P>
   Brazil built the original Maracana, a 200,000-capacity
megastadium, for the 1950 World Cup. The Yugoslavians constructed
an imitation in Belgrade on the site of the Crvena Zvezda (Red
Star) stadium in 1963. When the lights went out there at halftime
of the Yugoslavia-Croatia game last Wednesday, it was another black
eye for Slobodan Milosevic, but when the match finished 0-0, the
Yugoslavs were in command of Group 8 of Euro 2000 qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia next visits Ireland in a showdown for the group lead
Sept. 1 in a match that was postponed when the Irish refused to
issue visas to the Yugoslav delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Croatia edged Malta, 2-1, Saturday to overtake both
Ireland and Yugoslavia for the group lead. But the Croats will
likely be without Boban, the Milan midfielder who was injured
against Malta.

RUSSIAN PREMIER IS ADEPT AT PLAYING POLITICAL HEAVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With his thinning hair, angular face, and tightly
pursed lips, Vladimir Putin might resemble a stern high school vice
principal _ the type that scares the living daylights out of even
the best behaved pupils.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin apparently hopes that his latest
prime minister will do just that to the Kremlin's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, Russia's fifth prime minister in 17 months, is well-known
for playing hardball with his political foes. He was appointed Aug.
9 after Yeltsin and his inner circle _ known as The Family _
thought his predecessor, Sergei Stepashin, hadn't proved tough
enough in his 82 days in office.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's sin: He allowed Yeltsin's arch foe, Moscow's
ambitious mayor, Yury Luzhkov, to lure most of Russia's regional
leaders into an anti-Kremlin alliance that could dominate this
year's parliamentary elections and next summer's presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, however, earned a reputation for leaning hard on
opponents as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, as the Kremlin's point
man on corruption, and as director of the KGB's successor agency,
the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, for example, NTV commercial television reported
that the wife of St. Petersburg Governor Vladimir Yakovlev was the
subject of a criminal investigation. The report is still
unconfirmed, but politicians and journalists in St. Petersburg were
unanimous in suspecting that Putin's hand was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a political provocation,'' said St.
Petersburg-based investigative journalist Alexander Gorshkov, who
said that he didn't exclude that Putin was involved. ``Putin will
do whatever he is told by the president and his people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly enough circumstantial evidence from Putin's
past to suggest such a move. Earlier this summer, for example, when
Putin was director of the Federal Security Service, that agency
began probing the affairs of businesses allegedly tied to Luzhkov's
wife. When Russia's federal prosecutor was investigating corruption
in Yeltsin's inner circle, Putin reportedly furnished the media
with video tapes of a man resembling the prosecutor frolicking with
naked women.
</P>
<P>
   And even before this year's political battles began to heat up,
Putin was busy leaning on regional leaders. Last year the Federal
Security Service opened corruption investigations of uncooperative
leaders in several regions _ in some cases arresting high-ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the Voronesh region, for example, Putin's Federal Security
Service went after associates of that region's governor, Communist
Ivan Shabanov. As a result of a corruption investigation last year,
two of Shabanov's deputies were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Kremlin and in the (Federal Security Service) Putin
dealt with regional leaders by using blackmail,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a specialist in regional policy at the Moscow Carnegie
Center. ``He would gather compromising material on them and
threaten to use it if they don't behave as the Kremlin wants.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Russia's regional leaders enjoy immunity from
prosecution, Putin's Federal Security Service went after their
closest associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an attempt to frighten regional leaders, to show them
that even though they may be well-connected and have immunity from
prosecution, they can't protect their closest associates,'' said
Petrov. The message was loud and clear: If you are loyal, be as
corrupt as you like; if you cross the Kremlin, watch it.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years as a KGB spy in Germany, Putin's political career
began when he joined the local government in his hometown of St.
Petersburg. There, as a deputy to that city's first elected mayor
Anatoly Sobchak, Putin won praise for bringing foreign investment
to Russia's second city. He also was known as Sobchak's heavy
trotted out to deal with uncooperative foes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Belyayev, who served as speaker of St. Petersburg's
city council in the early 1990s, said Putin was a master at
``psyching out'' local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he talked to you he understood your psychological
profile, your needs, your weaknesses,'' said Belyayev. ``He used
this all to his advantage politically.''

NEC IS TEEMING WITH SUBPLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Count David Duval among those at Firestone Country
Club this week who will feel like they are in a familiar room with
new furniture.
</P>
<P>
   That's because what used to be the NEC World Series of Golf is
now the NEC Invitational, and while it's still a PGA Tour stop,
it's now also part of the World Golf Championships, a annual series
of mega-events put together by pro golf governing bodies in the
United States, Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The WGC made its debut in February (Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship for top 64 in world rankings), and another will
be held in November (American Express Championship for top 50). For
this event, the international golf braintrust came up with this
idea: Invite members of the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, 40 other players are here to attempt to knock Duval from
the champion's throne. He is, after all, the defending champ,
correct? ``Not really,'' said Duval, one of the few players who
checked in at Firestone Monday. He was on the range _ per usual,
hitting soft wedges _ and afterward said the makeup of the field
made for a different feel. Still, he said, ``It's an elite field.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, especially since it includes Duval, Tiger Woods,
and the kid from Spain who has muscled into their 1-1A act in
recent weeks, Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   But the field does not include all the winners of PGA Tour
events (and various world-wide tournaments) in the past year, which
used to be the criterion for an invite. Among those who are not
here? David Toms, who birdied the last two holes Sunday to pass
Duval and win the Sprint International in Castle Rock, Colo.
Fifteen other PGA Tour winners (Brandel Chamblee, Billy Andrade,
Chris Perry, Jeff Sluman, Rocco Mediate, Gabriel Hjerstedt, Tim
Herron, Loren Roberts, Olin Browne, Rich Beem, Ted Tryba, Duffy
Waldorf, J.L. Lewis, Brent Geiberger, and Tom Pernice Jr.) are not
here. Conversely, there are many in the field (Fred Couples and Lee
Janzen among them) who have not won in 1999 but earned invites
based on last year's Presidents Cup berth.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another change to this year's event, and
its color matches the fairways of this plush layout. Green. As in
money. Lots and lots of it. Last year's purse was $2,250,000, and
when he won, Duval earned $243,000. If he were to successfully
defend, his paycheck would be $1 million, since the purse for each
of these WGC parties is $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The argument has been raised that a berth on the Ryder Cup team
indirectly earns you pay, for it entitles you to a spot in this
tournament, in which last place (there is no cut) pays $25,000. And
it affords you the opportunity to win many times that.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the topic of $5 million aside _ if it is possible to do
so _ there is an intriguing backdrop to this week's tournament.
That is, a preview of next month's Ryder Cup matches, since all 24
players are here. It won't mean a thing, but if the Americans play
much better here than their European counterparts, expect to hear
more observers talking up a US walkover at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That's down the line, though. First things first for players
such as Jose Maria Olazabal, who Monday got in a practice round on
a slow day here. Then again, if you have fond memories of a place
(Olazabal stormed to a 12-shot win here in 1990 and triumphed again
in 1994), why not rush to embrace it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The course played great,'' said Olazabal, who owns the record
here with a 61 during that 1990 triumph. ``I said in 1990 that it
was in perfect shape, and it's the same this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to know that some things haven't changed at this
event.

   They started it. It is important for you to remember that. One
of them called me a ``chump.'' Another called me ``Mikey.'' One
misspelled my last name (Hollie?). Most misrepresented my words.
And then, essentially, all dared me to step outside for a verbal
rumble.
</P>
<P>
   I'm too old for this, right? It's been 10 years since I taunted
someone about sports, and even then I didn't have to say much. My
roommate at the time was a mouthy Steelers fan. So after the
Steelers lost their 1989 opener to the Browns, 51-0, I simply
flashed the screaming headlines from the Pittsburgh dailies
whenever he looked my way.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do with these Oakland A's fans, who have serenaded
me with e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   They are upset because they believe I slammed their team in a
column last week. They are angry because I had the nerve to
conclude that a team that hasn't had a winning record since 1992 is
``painfully mediocre.'' They fixated on 1986, called the Red Sox
the ``Blowsox'' and labeled me a Sox homer (Dan Duquette would get
a chuckle out of that one). They are angry because I believe that
playing for the wild card in August is silly. I know Sox fans can
point to 80 years of history to justify their belief in collapses
rather than comebacks, but I still think aiming for the consolation
prize is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   Responsible Option: Michael, be an adult. Stop this foolishness
and write about Brian Rose being sent to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Old-School Option: My man, they called you Mikey? What? Man,
dust off your Yo' Mama jokes right now. Like: Yo' Mama is so small,
you don't even call her ``Mama''; you call her ``A's attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe I should start.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I was surprised to learn that the A's even had
fans to taunt me. Oakland is the last team to win three consecutive
World Series titles. From 1972 to 1974, Oakland was the center of
the baseball universe. Except people in Oaktown were the only ones
who didn't pay attention. The average attendances those years were
13,164, 12,668, 11,124. In some cities, your attendance improves
when you get better. But East Bay logic is that fans decline the
more you win. I bet you could go to the middle of downtown Oakland
right now and yell, ``Hey, the A's won the '74 Series,'' and people
would start celebrating as if it were breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of all this is that I actually like the Bay Area. It
is the ultimate yin-yang setup, with artsy San Francisco on one
side of the Bay and gritty Oakland on the other. A brilliant writer
named Ishmael Reed spent a lot of time in Oakland (but native
daughter Gertrude Stein couldn't stand it). The Black Panthers and
an afroed Angela Davis made history in Oakland. When heiress Patty
Hearst was kidnapped in the '70s, her captors demanded an unusual
and honorable ransom: They wanted the city's poor to be fed. The
Celtics have Oakland's basketball team _ the Warriors _ to thank
for Robert Parish and Kevin McHale. Hip-hop fans have Oakland to
blame for MC Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it chump,'' wrote an A's fan named Paul, ``the A's aren't
going away . . . Have fun scrambling for the wild card, it's the
only chance your scrappy little team has.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are not my team, but Paul may have a point. While
everyone focused on Pedro Martinez's outburst last week, no one
mentioned that he and the Sox failed on a chance to slug the A's
and reduce the Yankees' lead in the AL East to 5 1/2 games. That
would have happened if Martinez had beaten an impressive Oakland
rookie named Tim Hudson. Instead, the A's got a split of their
four-game series and the Sox didn't take advantage of the shaky
baseball/hint of turmoil coming out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember an A's dynasty a few years back,'' wrote Bill,
``but I don't remember much from the Red Sox since the Mets
outclassed them. Was that in '86?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe I should start.
</P>
<P>
   These people really do have low expectations. Dynasty? I hope
Bill isn't talking about 1988-1990. During that time, the A's
appeared in three consecutive World Series and had a regular-season
low of 99 wins. They beat the Sox twice in the American League
Championship Series. They lost to the Dodgers in the '88 Series and
were swept by the Reds in '90. The '90 loss is still, I think, the
second-most disappointing sweep in Series history (the '54 Indians
have the top award all to themselves). But Oakland did win the
title in '89 _ the same year that the region was thinking more
about an earthquake than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about Oakland is that educators aren't afraid to
experiment. A few years ago, the Oakland School Board brought the
world something called Ebonics. They tried to make the argument
that black English should be taught, as if it were an African
language such as Wolof or Ga. Ebonics from the East Coast to the
West: Is y'all fools crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans talk about being cursed, but they have competition from
A's loyalists. There will never be anything worse than building the
Yankees' dominance by giving up Babe Ruth, but in 1976, the A's let
the following players walk and received no compensation: Don
Baylor, Bert Campaneris, Joe Rudi, Sal Bando, Gene Tenace, Rollie
Fingers, and Willie McCovey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee,'' Bart writes, ``how many World Series have the Sox won,
ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Joan adds, ``It's soooo nice that the Red Sox have soooo many
World Series trophies. How many? Let me see. Two? No. One? No. Let
me guess!! None. Wow, they really have something to be proud of . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll get to that soon. But I will say that the A's have a cushy
September. They have 20 games against the Tigers, Devil Rays,
Royals, and Angels. A decent team easily wins 14 of those games.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Sox, all they can do is beat up on the bad teams in
front of them and hope that the A's handle the baseball the same
way their fans handle history. It's been a long time, but the Sox
do own some World Series titles. Five of them. The first one was in
1903. And there were even some fans there to watch it.

AS A RUNNER, WARREN IS STILL BACKING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ How should we categorize the tale of one
Lamont Warren?
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy? Maybe. Comedy? Depends on how you look at it. Irony?
Yeah, that's it. Definitely some irony here. Or, better yet, this
may be a mixture of all three.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of our story is a running back who spent the first
five seasons of his NFL career backing up perennial Pro Bowler
Marshall Faulk in Indianapolis. After being released by the Colts
in April, Warren signed a free agent contract with the Patriots on
draft day. Now he could, potentially, spend the next five years of
his career backing up another Faulk, Marshall's cousin Kevin.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Warren was drafted by the Colts in the
sixth round the same year (1994) they took Marshall Faulk with the
second overall pick. Warren signed on for five years with New
England the same day the team drafted Kevin Faulk in the second
round. Both Faulks are from Louisiana, they're about the same size,
and they're the same type of running back _ shifty and elusive with
good receiving skills.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing they don't wear the same number, or we could be
talkut ``Twilight Zone'' material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little ironic,'' Warren said. ``Just can't get away
from 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   With two games remaining in the exhibition season, it appears
that Kevin Faulk has a firm grip on the running back spot left
vacant by the offseason injury to Robert Edwards. Warren did start
the first game of the exhibition season against Washington but was
ineffective and quickly gave way to Faulk, who staked his claim
with an impressive debut. This past Saturday night against the
Cowboys, Faulk didn't fare as well, gaining only 17 yards on 11
carries, but that was against Dallas's first-team defense. He did a
commendable job making the most out of very little running room.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, on the other hand, gained 46 yards on nine carries
against Dallas, including an 18-yarder in the fourth quarter. Most
of that yardage, though, came against second- and third-stringers.
But the action Warren saw was probably a preview of his role for
the regular season. The former University of Colorado track star
entered on third downs and twice lined up in the slot in a
four-receiver set. He ran precise out routes and caught two passes
for 18 yards. Against the Redskins, he caught a 17-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   If Faulk can carry the ball 20-25 times a game, Warren would be
the primary pass catcher out of the backfield. But with Derrick
Cullors and now Harold Shaw in the mix at halfback, Warren's
carries may very well be few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Is this why he chose New England over such suitors as Cincinnati
and Green Bay? Did he come to the Patriots to do the same thing he
did in his native Indianapolis?
</P>
<P>
   ``(A starting job) is pretty much the reason why I came, because
of the opportunity,'' said Warren, who rushed for 603 yards and
five touchdowns in his career as a Colt. ``I've been around for a
long time. I just wanted to at least get that opportunity to start
one time. I'm not worried about it. Here I'm getting a chance and I
think they'll find a way to get me on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going out there and playing and doing my job. We've
got a few more preseason games to go, so I'm really not thinking
about (starting) right now. I'm just trying to make sure my
performance is good. I think that as long as I'm sound in my
assignments, all of that will take care of itself. Whatever the
role is, I'd be willing to play it. However it unfolds, I'd be
willing to do whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy, comedy, irony. Someday it'll make for an excellent
trivia question.

 UNDATED: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Puff Daddy lives large. He entertains fellow celebs and high
rollers at his house in the Hamptons. He owns a clothing line, Sean
John, a magazine, Notorious, and a restaurant on New York's Lower
East Side, Justin's. He was to play a quarterback in the movie ``On
Any Given Sunday,'' but the production kept getting delayed and he
had to bail. He has a deal with Miramax for a movie called ``King
Zuckerman.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles, not one of his frequent gestures, when a reporter
checks his fingers to see how many he has, the (lame) joke being
that he has his fingers in so many pies, you wonder if he's got
more than 10. ``Music is the number one priority,'' he asserts.
</P>
<P>
   He travels with an entourage that fills a van. He sports two
thick chains around his neck, one dangling a large
diamond-encrusted crucifix, the other an equally large and
diamond-encrusted madonna and child. He was raised Catholic and was
an altar boy. He's not a churchgoer today, but he says, ``I'm
definitely a 100 percent believer, I just don't practice. I
consider myself nondemoninational, but say I was baptized Catholic.
I turned out OK. I can't denounce it. I just couldn't get with the
whole idea of `Kneel here and do this.' It's not just Catholics,
but men making the rules, men with egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Puff Daddy, of course, is not without ego. And he can be more
than a little ostentatious, which some folks might see conflicting
with his professed spirituality. Case in point: His luxury car, the
chains around his neck. ``I can at times be ostentatious about
it,'' Puffy admits. ``You know, I'm human. Being a man, I can't be
judged by people. What you see is what you get. Because I worked
hard and made money, that doesn't give you any right to have
something against me. I found a lot of support from my fans and
people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Puffy supports a charity, Daddy's House, which supports programs
for low-income kids to which he says he's donated $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that seems to eat at Puff Daddy, at least to a degree,
is the suspicion that his fame comes at the expense of tragedy. In
1991, an oversold charity basketball game he organized resulted in
a stampede and the death of nine people. And there's the death of
the Notorious B.I.G., a shooting many think was done in retaliation
for the killing of Tupac Shakur, in a West Coast-East Coast rap
war. (No one has been charged in either killing. Puff Daddy says he
has no idea who killed Shakur or B.I.G.)
</P>
<P>
   With ``Forever,'' Puffy says, ``I definitely turned a corner,
but you know you have to handle whatever ball is thrown at you,
that's just the way some people got a hold of my name after what
happened. Of course, everything is magnified and that comes with
it. It's nobody's fault. The good things are magnified, too, and
you gotta take the good with the bad. . . . You go through them,
and when I went through them I had nobody around but God, so my
spirituality is so much stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the van, Puff Daddy juggles multiple mobile phones like a
Karamazov brother; during a rare moment when he's not on the phone
or talking to an interviewer, his eyes shut behind his dark
glasses, as he catches maybe a 30-second catnap, before the phone
beeps and the process starts up again. He apologizes for the
seeming rudeness _ ``family business'' _ but Puff Daddy is the
consummate multitasker. Cell phones are his lifeline to the world
outside his immediate physical orbit, and there are a lot of folks
he needs, or wants, to be able to reach out and touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like everything I have asked for will get done
wrong, so I just started making sure it got done right,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Puff Daddy admits he got wrong was agreeing to appear
in a video of a song called ``Hate Me Now,'' made by a friend, Nas,
that had Puffy up on a cross, Jesuslike, perhaps raising the aura
of Puff Daddy as a persecuted Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   What was he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself that question,'' Puffy says. ``When I get in
trouble: Why the hell did I do that in the first place? I mean,
when we did this I didn't think that I tried to portray Jesus, but
it looks like I did. . . . People (would have thought) my
relationship with God was just a joke. I love God and would never
do that. I got myself into a situation and had to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not in the best way. There was an altercation between
Puffy and Steve Stoute, an executive at Nas's label, Interscope,
about the video. Puffy wanted out; Stoute held his ground. Stoute
alleged that Puffy turned over his desk, broke his arm and jaw, and
assaulted him with a champagne bottle. No bottles, no broken bones,
says Puffy. In June, they came to a settlement, though Puffy says
no money changed hands. The video never aired. (A Manhattan
district attorney is still pursuing the case even though Stoute is
not pressing charges.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be a learning lesson,'' Puffy says. One of his
flaws, he adds, is ``I have to take time to appreciate certain
things. Sometimes I don't realize the stuff I say, because of who I
am, they may take it in a different way. If I say `shut up' to
somebody, it's like, I gotta watch stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to join Puffy's crew, well, sorry, the spaces are
filled. ``I don't make no new friends,'' he says. ``I got my boys
right here and besides that, I don't need no new friends.'' A line
from ``P.E. 2000'': ``A lot of strange faces, I can only trust
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Romance? The CEO is single, recently broken up with his
girlfriend, Kim. A rough breakup? ``No,'' he says, ``100 times less
than yours (would be). I'm a cool cat.'' And what about the rumors
he's dating Jennifer Lopez? She's just a friend. ``We just be
kicking it,'' he tells the WJMN afternoon audience. ``You know,
everybody tries to assume. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing, and one thing only, Puff Daddy would like
you to take away from this story, it is this: His album is out
today (Aug. 24) And you should buy it.

THE BASEMENT WASN'T AMONG THE FITTEST RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do retailers fail?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is pretty basic: There are too many of them to begin
with and they are all trying to expand at the same time. Even in
terrific economic times like these there simply aren't enough
dollars to support all of them. The laws of mathematics guarantee
some chains aren't going to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition has never been fiercer,'' says Eileen Leary,
an analyst with State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement is just the latest casualty in the Darwinian
struggle that American retailing has become. The Basement filed for
bankruptcy Monday after years of poor financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation, the Basement is part of a good-sized
club. Fedco, a Southern California retailer, filed for bankruptcy
in July; Loehmann's, a popular New York discounter, filed for
Chapter 11 in May. Over the past few years, New England chains,
including Bradlees, Caldor, and Ames, have operated for a time
under the protection of the bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   New England chains have been particularly vulnerable because the
region's population doesn't grow very fast yet the supply of stores
does. Some of the nation's biggest retailers have just arrived in
New England in the past few years, making an already tight market
even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart now has 95 stores in New England, up from 45 just four
years ago. Target, a subsidiary of Dayton-Hudson, has just begun
opening stores in Massachusetts; the company says it could have two
dozen stores in New England within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the new entries literally take over the locations
vacated by the competitors they have vanquished. Life doesn't get
much more Darwinian than that. Both Wal-Mart and Target have made
bids for some of the sites Caldor once occupied. Caldor was forced
to liquidate when it couldn't come up with a viable recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   What separates the winners from the losers?
</P>
<P>
   Size is one thing. The big national chains can take advantage of
scale to win lower prices from their suppliers. In the current
environment, where it is difficult if not impossible for stores to
raise their prices, those lower costs translate into bigger profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   The big chains can also make the investments necessary to build
state-of-the-art computer systems. According to Steve Paspal, a
money manager with Sovereign Asset Management, Wal-Mart has used
its computers both to keep precise track of what its customers are
buying and to keep its inventories as lean as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The deep pockets that come with size have allowed the national
chains to build bigger, more attractive stores where the
merchandise can be displayed in eye-catching ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger stores are easier to shop in,'' says Leary. ``You
can find what you want and get in and out fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But size isn't everything. Giants such as Sears, J.C. Penney,
and Kmart have all struggled. Their problem? Poor positioning, says
Susan D. Sampson, director of the Prince Program in retail
management at Simmons College.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a clear message,'' says Sampson. ``The
customer doesn't know where to put them in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners, says Sampson, have a distinct identity: Wal-Mart is
the place to go for low-cost hard goods; Target is the star in soft
goods; TJX, a Framingham, Mass. chain, is a leader in family
apparel. Ames, which has twice gone through bankruptcy, has
prospered by becoming a chain that appeals mainly to low-income
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The losers aren't bad stores. They simply aren't special enough.
Their me-too message gets lost in he clutter and their customers
vote with their feet for competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Basement falls into this category. It is cheap, but not any
cheaper than many other stores. It sells clothes with well-known
lablels, but again, so do others. It may be special in downtown
Boston because of its history, but elsewhere it is one more
discounter trying to find a spot in a crowded market.
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't about to get any easier for retailers. The rise of
the Internet guarantees a whole new group of rivals for existing
players. If only a small piece of the pie goes to Internet
start-ups, there will be that much less for the bricks and mortar
companies to divide.
</P>
<P>
   And the economy isn't going to get better. Consumer confidence
is at record levels; the unemployment rate is near a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have rarely been this good for retailers,'' says Mark
Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, a
Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   When and if the economy weakens, the glut of stores will be more
pronounced and the competition will get fiercer still. At that
point, as Charles Darwin might have put it, only the fittest will
survive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   McDonald's, the world's largest user of beef, is feeling the
heat again for its treatment of cattle. In the past few weeks,
militant animal-rights activists have been suspected in the burning
of a McDonald's in Antwerp, and a leading US animal rights group,
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, angrily abandoned
talks with the restaurant chain, charging the company viewed animal
welfare merely as a public relations issue.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, for its part, has offered some dramatic pledges. At
the company's annual meeting in May, Jack Greenberg, the chairman
and chief executive, vowed: ``We want to take industry leadership
in animal welfare.'' And recently, a McDonald's spokeman said: ``We
are sincere in this area and we have a big stake in the whole
issue. We want to make a positive difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you hadn't heard, McDonald's has moved swiftly on the
issue. The improvement in the animals' circumstances has been
nothing less than breathtaking. On a recent inspection tour, I
walked _ gingerly _ among the cattle becoming, you might expect, a
fly on the wall, and jotted down the following conversation. But
despite all I saw I am still no closer to answering the crucial
question: Are the cows happy?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, Patty, sometimes it all seems so futile,'' said
Chuck. ``Sure we've got it good _ it's great now. But what's the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck stretched his hooves out on the lounger, closed his runny
bovine lips around a fat Cuban cigar, and sighed the sigh of an
existential Holstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck, enough of the gloom, the despair. It doesn't do anybody
any good,'' Patty told him. ``Our parents and our parents' parents
and their parents' parents way back all suffered so we could enjoy
the good life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dreadfully hot August day, and a steaming rain pounded
on the roof. Chuck and Patty were dry and cozy in their single,
detached pen cooled by the breeze of a high-powered air
conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure they suffered,'' Chuck said, ``and I live with the
guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh brother,'' Patty moaned. ``Listen to me. Would you rather
be herded by the thousands like . . . like . . . cattle, and live
day in and day out with no room to breathe, let alone move, with
little light, have chemicals shot into you and feel all painfully
fattened up, and get diseased or go lame, have your liver fail on
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the same in the end,'' Chuck reminded her. ``But go
ahead and call the folks at McDonald's if you insist. They'll take
care of it, you know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't pretend you don't want cable TV too. Is it so much to
ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it makes it easier for you,'' Chuck said. ``But have a look
at me, Patty. What's there before you? That's right: a Big Mac. A
whole afternoon of Big Macs on the griddle. That's what it's all
about, Patty. We know exactly what we were put here on earth for.
So what's the use of everyone making a fuss whether or not we have
ice for our Cokes and all-cotton bed sheets?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck, can't you just enjoy what we've got?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, Patty, it's the good life that makes it all worse.
Cramp me in a stall. Inject me with strange drugs. Torture me any
way you like. I'll be a happier Chuck when my time comes to be
burgered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Utter nonsense, you old bull.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a rap at the door, and two men entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you here for the cable?'' Patty inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am. We're here for Chuck. Let's go _ hoof it, big
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But _'' Patty stammered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get philosophical,'' Chuck said. ``Just MOOOOO your
lungs out!''

IT'S HER RACE TO WIN

   Can Silverbulletday win Horse of The Year honors?
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old filly put on an awesome display in winning the
Alabama by 9 lengths at Saratoga last Saturday, and, with
Charismatic, Silver Charm, Free House, Victory Gallop, and Real
Quiet lost to injury, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is beginning to shape up as one of those years when the
oldest, strongest male does not capture racing's biggest prize.
Behrens, the last legitimate handicap horse left, lacks charisma,
and though he is a gem of consistency, he has lost three races
(7-4-3-0). The Golden Eclipse is probably his to lose, but it won't
take much more than one more defeat for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday's record is sensational. She has won seven of
eight starts this year, 13 of 15 in her career. There is precedence
for a 3-year-old filly to be top horse, as the great European grass
filly All Along won it in 1983 after making an undefeated tour of
North America. And Lady's Secret was a worthy winner in 1986 at the
age of 4, proving that if females are popular enough, they can get
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, who is ridden by Jerry Bailey, trained by Bob
Baffert, and owned by Mike Pegram, proved she has the quality to
run long, which is important. She handled the mile and one-quarter
of the Alabama with ease, running away through the stretch even
though the pace was slow. ``She was a little wide and had to run
down a soft pace,'' said Bailey. ``She surprised even me, she's
that good.''
</P>
<P>
   What Silverbulletday hasn't done, something both All Along and
Lady's Secret did do, was beat males. Her only flop this year came
in the mile and one-half Belmont Stakes, when she tired after a
mile and one-quarter of battling the boys and faded to seventh. At
the time, Baffert offered several rationales for entering her in
such a tough spot, none of which made any sense.
</P>
<P>
   But Pegram came right out and said: ``If Charismatic (who had
already won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness) wins the Belmont,
there's no way he won't be Horse of the Year.'' Pegram, who also
owns Real Quiet, figured if Charismatic could be stopped, either
one of his two horses had a shot at Horse of the Year. If
Silverbulletday, who was sent right to the lead, happened to do the
stopping, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Pegram say they have no further plans to take on
males. Their next assignment for Silverbulletday, a meeting with
filly handicap standout Banshee Breeze in the Spinster Stakes at
Keeneland Oct. 16, is almost as daunting. Undefeated this year at 4
for 4, Banshee Breeze is herself a Horse of the Year candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If the voters are not inclined to vote for a female who has not
beaten males, that projects 2-year-old colt More Than Ready into
the big picture. Impressive from the start, More Than Ready is 5
for 5 and could be the real deal. Secretariat (1972), who was
worthy, and Favorite Trick (1997), who was not, both won Horse of
the Year as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   In an open year such as this, star quality counts for a lot.
And, right now, there's no bigger star than Silverbulletday.

   Baez begins rehab
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Rudy Baez, who suffered paralysis from the waist down in
a spill at Rockingham Park Aug. 4, has begun an intensive
rehabilitation program at the Keeler Institute in West Orange, N.J.
The Keeler Institute specializes in spinal cord injuries and
treated actor Christopher Reeve, who was injured in a show jumping
accident and has become a spokesman for the cause. Baez, who
underwent surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital before being
flown to the Keeler Institute last Thursday, is scheduled for two
months of rehabilitation. ``He's doing well right now,'' said Mike
Szpuk, Baez's agent. ``He's getting ready for rehab.'' Noted for
his tenacious style, Baez, 47, was long the leading rider in New
England and won 4,878 races to stand 17th on the all-time list. His
wife, Judy, and their children, 16-year-old Jessica and 10-year-old
Christopher, appreciate the efforts of those who have offered
support, as cards and letters, including one from Reeve, have
poured in. Donations can be made to The Rudy Baez Fund, c/o Eastern
Bank (attn. Rachel Sosnowski), 125 Washington St., B309, Salem,
01970. The Internet site is www.rudybaez.com . . . Jockey Gary
Stevens, who has been riding in Great Britain, will return to the
United States in time to ride on the Travers Stakes program at
Saratoga Saturday. He will now ride first-call for the powerful The
Thoroughbred Corporation. Stevens, who went to England May 29, rode
46 winners overseas, his last being Maramba at Sandown Park last
Saturday. ``The entire stay has been fun, and the whole of Royal
Ascot was very pleasing,'' said Stevens. ``The variety of courses
keeps your mind fresh and keeps an extra hop in your step.''

<P>
   Walden's double
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Elliot Walden will send out a powerful duo in the $1
million Travers, as he'll be represented by both Menifee, who won
the Haskell at Monmouth, and Ecton Park, who took the Jim Dandy at
The Spa, both on Aug 8. Both horses drilled over the Oklahoma
training track Saturday, with Menifee going 5 furlongs in 1:00 4/5,
and Ecton Park the same distance in 1:01. ``I was very pleased with
the works,'' said Walden. ``They both look like they came back good
and happy.'' Also working for the Travers was Lemon Drop Kid, who
won the Belmont but ran second to Ecton Park in the Jim Dandy. The
big colt went 5 panels over the main track in 1:00 2/5 . . . Malek,
a key contender for the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar
Sunday, went 6 furlongs in 1:10 4/5 Friday, raising the eyebrows of
trainer Richard Mandella. ``It's the best work I've ever seen him
do,'' said Mandella. The former champion of Chile finished third
four straight times this year, before Mandella dropped him into the
Viking Spirit Handicap July 29, which he won.

IT'S TREASURE OR TRASH ON `ANTIQUES ROADSHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Every one of the 6,500 ``Antiques Roadshow''
devotees who came to the Rhode Island Convention Center ON Saturday
knows this story:
</P>
<P>
   A nice elderly woman from New Jersey buys a little table at a
garage sale for $25, puts her telephone on it and thinks nothing of
it for years. Then the PBS show comes to town, and she wonders what
her find is really worth, so she takes it along.
</P>
<P>
   Appraiser Leigh Keno, who with his twin brother, Leslie, is now
undoubtedly the most famous American furniture expert in the
country, can barely breathe when he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   Keno tells her the mahogany card table, labeled by furniture
makers John and Thomas Seymour, is one of only seven or eight such
pieces known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the moment every viewer waits for.
</P>
<P>
   How much is that little table worth? There is a pause, then the
familiar tinkling of bells as the price is flashed across the
bottom of the screen: $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, she looks as if she might swoon. So does Keno.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Several months later, the table goes to
auction on an especially good day and fetches $490,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nice woman from New Jersey and others like her are the
reason the ``Antiques Roadshow'' is the highest-rated prime-time
PBS program in the country.
</P>
<P>
   She is also the reason all those people showed up at Saturday,
hoping to strike it similarly rich with all manner of tchotchke
snagged at garage sales, inherited from ailing aunts, or dug out
from under piles of junk in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The show, taping its fourth season, is based on a long-running
English program, and inspires a quasireligious devotion among
audiences and hopeful collectors. Impeccably dressed Chris Jussel,
the presenter, and the appraisers, like the Keno brothers, had
participants in awe Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy endings are also a part of the show's appeal: Many
viewers will sheepishly admit to drawing as much pleasure from low
valuations as high ones, as long-held family myths are debunked and
prized hand-me-downs are exposed as fakes. But participants
obviously hope for happier outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   They brought cigar store Indians and snakeskin bags, tattered
rugs and Aunt Jemima door-stops. They brought ancient-looking
swords and sad old dolls.
</P>
<P>
   And they waited. Many arrived as early as 5 a.m. Some _ as many
as a hundred, organizers said _ spent the night camping outside the
convention center. Once inside the building, a huge line snaked
around a dozen barriers, and most of the hopeful visitors waited
three hours before getting near the appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Wright, of Rhode Island, brought an elaborate jade, gold,
and ivory Chinese-style box that was intriguing enough to get her a
taped segment on the show. The vast majority of participants don't
make it to the cameras, but receiving free appraisals from experts
who have become as familiar as actors seems payoff enough for most
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Expert Lark E. Mason Jr. of Sotheby's, New York, had never seen
anything like the box. It was made by Edward Farber, a famous maker
of fine-quality desk articles. It was made of 18-carat gold, and
jade and ivory panels taken from a wealthy Chinese 16th century
tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Big find. As much as $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   But while most ``Antiques Roadshow'' hopefuls might jump and
yelp at such a valuation, Wright was not too surprised.
</P>
<P>
   She'd been given the box by a wealthy family friend when she was
10, she said, and he had taken out high insurance on it for her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the value of the box, this was not the ideal
``Roadshow'' experience, and several members of the production
staff seemed disappointed: the show's allure, after all, depends on
suspense and surprise, the sense that the average viewer, too,
could have a fortune lying around the house and not know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is accessible to everyone,'' said Anne Zeiser,
publicist for WGBH. ``Everybody has a family story, a relic from
the past, an attic or a basement. The show gives you all these
little vignettes, each building up to that moment when you find out
if they've got trash or treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Van Varick of Rochester, N.Y., hoped his Queen Anne mirror
would be worth a fortune. Van Varick, 20, who arrived at 7:30 a.m.,
knew the history of the mirror backwards, it having been in his
family for a long time. And he had a typewritten account of its
provenance, written in 1899, which said the mirror had once
belonged to 18th century American statesman Jonathan Trumbull, an
ancestor of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta work myself down. I can't get too excited. I can't get
my hopes up,'' Van Varick said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was waiting, he spotted the Keno brothers working
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best, the Keno brothers,'' he said. ``When they
get excited, they get all giddy, `Oh, I saw this one in line; I saw
you from afar.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Van Varick's mirror, dated at about 1750, was
appraised at about $1,500, since the glass and gilding had been
replaced. But the provenance added another $500 to its value. Van
Varick was disappointed, but not broken. ``It was fun just being
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, his mirror had been appraised by the Leslie
Keno.

PUFF DADDY'S NEW CD MEANS A CHANCE FOR PROMOTION

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   The switch is flipped and the thin figure dressed in white,
wearing a cap and dark glasses, sporting thousands of dollars'
worth of jewelry and sitting quietly in a suburban radio station
studio, snaps to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whassup, whassup, whassup, whassup, Beantown, Boston, what's
goin' on?'' Sean (Puffy) Combs, a.k.a. Puff Daddy, asks the WJMN-FM
(``Jam'n'' 94.5) audience. ``I got a new album I'm promoting after
two and a half years. I'm gonna drop this new bomb on y'all. It's
called `Forever' and it comes out to the stores August 24.It's the
sequel to `No Way Out.' If you liked `No Way Out,' if you liked the
tour, get ready, we coming with a hotter album, a hotter tour, a
hotter everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got a glass of champagne by his side. He hopes _ believes _
he still has the world on a string.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity juggernaut that is Puff Daddy _
multiplatinum-selling hip-hop act, CEO of the Bad Boy Entertainment
label _ is on a roll. ``It's not wack, it's worth buying, you
know?'' he says, of ``Forever.'' It's the first week in August and
Puff Daddy is in the early phase of a 28-city promotional tour
where he will yak up his album, and its first single, ``P.E.
2000,'' all over radio. Here, he touches down at Logan, phones WJMN
in Waltham to say he's in the tunnel, running late. After he leaves
the station _ where he mentions the day of album release a dozen
times in under an hour _ he's spirited over to WILD-AM (1090) in
Roxbury where he yaks the yak again, dropping the names of his
costars on the album, R Kelly, Jay Z, Nas, Bizzy Bone of Bone
Thugs-N-Harmony, Lil' Kim, Twista, Busta Rhymes, Mario
``Yellowman'' Winans and others. The late Notorious B.I.G., Puff
Daddy's pal and Bad Boy cash cow, gunned down in March 1997 by an
unknown assailant, appear as well.
</P>
<P>
   A Puff Daddy album is very much about collaboration. He is more
the ``organizer'' than the star performer. He has referred to
himself as not ``an MC, but a vibe giver.'' During the
station-to-station journey, he talks to a reporter in the van. He's
less effusive, more laconic, and more serious in this mode.
</P>
<P>
   You can call him Puffy, Puff Daddy, P-Diddy, or he says,
``whatever you want to call me.'' He says he won't tell where he
got his nickname. ``Nobody knows that,'' he says, implying that
nobody ever will. The only person who calls him by his given name,
Sean, is his mother, or, he says on the radio, the police. ``When I
hear `Sean,' that is a serious, serious thing, like, you know,
somebody giving you a ticket.'' Famous for driving around in a
$375,000 1999 Bentley Azure, Puff Daddy won't be behind the wheel
for a while. License suspended, he says, long story. He has to take
a road test to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   But don't feel too sorry for him. You can spot Puff Daddy at No.
16 on Forbes magazine's list of top moneymaking entertainers, with
last year's income estimated at $53.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't bad,'' Puffy, 29, says, but he goes on to note that
real wealth is Rockefeller wealth, generations of it. Puff Daddy is
always looking at the next level up. ``When people talk about being
overly wealthy, that's like $500 million and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Puff Daddy projects a serious mien. He's very much
about the business. Bad Boy Entertainment, a label that employs 300
people, grossed $200 million in 1997, $35 million last year. Puffy
stepped out from behind the producer's console _ where he launched
the Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, MA

GOODING'S IN NEED OF A REAL ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1997, when he won the best supporting actor Oscar for his
role in ``Jerry Maguire,'' Cuba Gooding Jr. gave one of the most
exuberant, buoyant acceptance speeches in Academy Award history.
Who could have guessed then that, nearly three years later, we'd
still be waiting for him to do anything as memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding will soon be seen in the formulaic action film ``Chill
Factor,'' in which he shares above-the-title credits with Skeet
Ulrich. Yes, folks, that's Skeet Ulrich _ not to be confused with
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich _ whose best known role is probably
as the skanky thug who beats up Greg Kinnear in ``As Good As It
Gets.'' Say what? When did Ulrich become enough of a star to merit
equal billing with the Oscar-winning Gooding, and how has Gooding's
post-Oscar path landed him in a movie with a bland young actor
named Skeet?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is yet another case of Hollywood racism rearing its
head. Everyone knows that most black actors are on the pay-no-mind
list when it comes to getting A-list roles. But when he snagged the
coveted statuette, Gooding looked good to defy the odds and break
big as a leading actor. Even though his greatest recognition came
in a supporting role, Gooding had already proven his star skills
with his debut (and still best) role as Tre Styles in John
Singleton's ``Boyz N the Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's tough to name anything _ let alone anything
worthwhile _ Gooding has done in recent years other than those
stupid Pepsi commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he had a small role in ``As Good As It Gets.''
Last year, he played second fiddle to Robin Williams and
breathtaking art direction in the little-seen ``What Dreams May
Come.'' Earlier this year, he basically played the Jodie Foster
role to Sir Anthony Hopkins' hammy riff as a Hannibal Lecter-like
killer in the widely-panned ``Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for ``As Good As It Gets,'' which, let's face it,
belonged to Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, none of his films have
been hits. So now Gooding is trying to trod the big dumb action
film route paved by his fellow Oscar recipient Nicolas Cage, who,
after proving his acting mettle in ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' turned
his attention to $20 million paychecks with dreck like ``Con Air,''
``The Rock,'' ``Eight Millimeter'' and ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Chill Factor'' _ which sounds like a cross between
``Speed'' and ``Broken Arrow'' _ Gooding and Ulrich play a couple
of guys trying to keep chemical weapons away from the bad guys. No
matter what spin Gooding may try to put on this, it can hardly be
viewed as a career-boosting move, and make no mistake, his career
needs a boost. After all, when he won the Oscar, he was mentioned
alongside such past winners as Denzel Washington and Sidney
Poitier. At the rate he's going, he may soon find his name in the
same category as F. Murray Abraham, who won a best actor Oscar in
``Amadeus,'' and went on to appear in such forgettable fare as
``Mobsters,'' ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' and ``National Lampoon's
Loaded Weapon I.'' Here's hoping we won't soon see Gooding in part
II.''

</P>
<P>
   Does anyone know why Claire Danes, who has starred in two
stinkers this year _ ``The Mod Squad'' and ``Brokedown Palace'' _
is considered a major talent? Neither do I . . . Will someone,
somewhere please give the multitalented Lea DeLaria her own TV show
(she could easily revive the long-dormant variety format) or cast
her in a big, juicy part in a major film? She can sing, having
wowed critics in an off-Broadway production of the classic musical
``On the Town;'' she can act, having recently played Audrey in the
Williamstown Theatre Festival's production of William Shakespeare's
``As You Like It;'' and she's a ribald, take-no-prisoners comedian,
whose sharp comic tongue will be on display Thursday in her show,
``It's Delicious, It's Delightful, It's DeLaria,'' at Town Hall in
Provincetown. She has the same whip-smart, offbeat charm as Janeane
Garofalo, and certainly room should be made for bold,
think-for-themselves women who shun the Hollywood cookie-cutter for
their own quirky rhythms, which shatter every stereotypical female
mold . . . Boston, which for better and probably worse all but
invented the boy group phenomenon in the 1980s with New Edition and
New Kids on the Block, is again making its mark in the current wave
with LFO, which stands for Lyte Funkie Ones. Their hip-hop flavored
``Summer Girls'' is currently No. 3 on the Billboard's Hot 100
chart. Pop pablum rules!

   FORTUNE, Prince Edward Island _ The big trout in the green tank
are voracious eaters, their pink mouths wide open with anticipation
as they swarm beneath their automatic feeding tray. Every time the
tray drops new food pellets, the water becomes a mad splash of
writhing fish.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them for being hungry? They are growing boys and
girls, genetically programmed to grow about eight times faster than
normal during the first year of their lives. Compared to the
skinny, ordinary trout swimming in the next tank, these 18-inch
fish are giants among Lilliputians.
</P>

   This is ground zero in what supporters are calling ``the blue
revolution'' that could soon sweep the fishing industry _ and the
world's dinner plates. By inserting extra genes into fish, the
would-be revolutionaries hope to conquer the last wild frontier in
the food supply, creating fish that grow faster, live in colder
waters, and even fight off disease better than the ones Mother
Nature produces.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Massachusetts-based company that owns this
hatchery, A/F Protein, is gearing up for large-scale production of
fast-growing trout and Atlantic salmon. Worldwide, researchers have
found the genetic keys to rapid growth in at least 11 commercially
valuable fish species, including shrimp growing at the University
of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But, before the first genetically altered smoked salmon hit the
market, the fledgling industry is caught in the rising controvery
over genetic tinkering with the food supply. Critics warn that the
lab-created fish could escape and damage wild fish stocks, while
consumers worry that genetically altered food of all kinds may not
be healthy or tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move aquaculture into a better direction than it
has right now,'' said Boyce Thorne-Miller of SeaWeb, a
Washington-based advocacy group that criticizes aquaculture for
polluting coastal waters with concentrated fish feces. Genetic
engineering, she fears, ``could make things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the new industry say the fears are misplaced,
promising that their fish will be as wholesome as conventional
fish, just more abundant. They also plan precautions to prevent
genetically altered fish from upsetting the balance of nature, such
as neutering the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the amount of misinformation and
emotional reactions that are not based on science,'' said Elliot
Entis, chief executive of A/F Protein, whose corporate headquarters
is in Waltham. ``Our position is that our fish are basically
unchanged in all respects from the wild fish. What we have done is
really a juggling of the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, controversy over genetically modified food, including
attacks on crops in Europe, is taking a toll. New England salmon
farmers, growers of the region's third most valuable seafood, have
shown little interest in genetically altered salmon, fearing that
they, too, could be drawn into the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without knowing a lot more about it, I think the consuming
public would have difficulties with a genetically engineered
salmon,'' said Michael Hastings, director of the Maine Aquaculture
Innovations Center, an industry research group. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Marking a milestone &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the advent of genetically altered fish marks a
milestone in the history of food. Nearly every other food group,
from meat to vegetables to fruit, has been cross-bred almost beyond
recognition after millennia of human agriculture. Fish, by
contrast, are mostly harvested from the wild, shaped only by the
forces of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But a rising human population has decimated the world's fishing
grounds, increasing pressure to more intensively manage the fishing
industry. Japan tried in the 1980s to create genetically superior
``superfish,'' including a tuna that researchers hoped might swim
to the net when it is ready for market.
</P>
<P>
   However, the quest for the superfish proved more difficult and
time consuming than many had hoped, both because genetics is so
complex and because species such as salmon take years to reach
sexual maturity. Today, although nearly 20 percent of the world's
fish and shellfish come from aquaculture, none, with the possible
exception of fish sold in mainland China, have been genetically
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inside a modest fish hatchery between the lobster boats and
potato fields of rural Prince Edward Island, the West may be closer
than ever to a commercially available superfish. A/F Protein
officials hope to test their fish in ocean pens next summer and, if
they win US and Canadian regulatory approval, begin selling
genetically altered salmon and trout by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the researchers who started A/F Protein were not
trying to make fish grow when they began in the mid-1970s. They
were trying to understand how flounder survive in frigid Canadian
waters that would kill salmon; but, it turned out that the same
gene that allows flounder to survive the cold could be combined
with a second gene to speed growth as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to boost growth by 20 to 30 percent, Garth Fletcher, a
fish biologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Choy Hew
of the University of Toronto injected the salmon embryo with a gene
that promotes antifreeze production along with a gene for making
salmon growth hormone. Together, the genes programmed the salmon to
produce growth hormone continuously, and to produce it in two
organs rather than the normal one.
</P>
<P>
   To the researchers' surprise, the salmon grew 400 to 600 percent
faster during their first 14 months. The combination also worked on
other fish, including rainbow trout that grew 8 to 10 times faster
than normal in their first year.
</P>
<P>
   And, although these fish needed more oxygen and food than
ordinary fish, they were big enough to go to market up to a year
earlier as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as fantastic. The growth rates and the cost of
production of the genetically modified fish are in no way
comparable to regular fish,'' said Sefton Dixon, a Prince Edward
Island salmon farmer who recently formed a company called OvaTech
with five other fish farmers to distribute A/F Protein's
genetically modified fish as soon as they are available.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government has backed genetic engineering of fish
as well, funding the research, and sending government officials to
public events such as taste tests designed to show that genetically
altered fish taste fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian enthusiasm has not been matched on the US side of
the border, where aquaculture companies face more scrutiny and
criticism in part because more people live on the coast. Although
Entis of A/F Protein spoke to Maine salmon growers in 1995, fish
farmers have been reluctant to commit to a technology that could
bring them unwanted publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of my farmers have told me that they want me to put out a
request for proposals on engineered salmon. They've got a lot of
other problems that are a lot higher priority,'' said Hastings of
the Maine Aquaculture Innovations Center. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Flood of critics &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, genetic engineering of fish faces a steady stream of
criticism ranging from groups such as Greenpeace that oppose it to
developing nations that fear the technology will help the
industrialized world at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Goldburg of the Environmental Defense Fund, for
instance, has warned that genetically altered fish could be so
tough that they out-compete wild fish for limited food and spawning
areas. Alternately, the fish could interbreed with wild fish,
changing their genetic makeup in unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   Several observers fear that the new fish could cause allergic
reactions or other unexpected side effects for consumers that
regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration could easily
miss.
</P>
<P>
   But A/F Protein hatchery manager Arnie Sutterlin, over a
breakfast of genetically engineered smoked salmon, said people will
soon learn they have nothing to fear. ``I cannot tell the
difference and I've eaten literally 20 pounds of the stuff,'' he
said. ``They're just like other fish. They just grow up faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither US nor Canadian regulators have raised concerns about
the safety of the new fish so far. Canadian government-funded
studies of the genetically altered salmon have found that they
appear, swim, and behave like ordinary salmon, except that they eat
and breathe a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, A/F Protein officials are trying to ease public edginess
by promising to label genetically altered products and using only
fish genes in their research rather than the mouse and bacteria
genes that some have used. In addition, they expect the FDA to
insist on conditions to prevent the fish from escaping, such as
enclosed tanks or fish that cannot reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one can guarantee that these protections will
work. Fish farmers are unlikely to support expensive indoor tanks
instead of the ocean nets they use now, Sutterlin said, and the
pressure treatment to neuter salmon sometimes produces defects such
as deformed jaws or poor ocean survival.
</P>
<P>
   Even if A/F Protein's fish can be grown safely, critics
conclude, this is the start of a whole new field that has attracted
research institutes from Baltimore's Christopher Columbus Center to
the University of Connecticut's Biotechnology Research Program. As
the number and type of genetic manipulations increase, they say
risks could multiply.
</P>
<P>
   But A/F Protein officials are counting on public doubts to fade
over time, much as apprehension about eating salmon raised on fish
farms did in the 1980s. Then, genetic engineering of fish could
become just one more unnoticed tool for managing the human food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer has no idea where their food comes
from,'' said Sutterlin. ``The chicken comes from the jungle fowl of
Asia. It's got the texture of manila rope. All of the food we eat
has been manipulated'' over the centuries. Soon, he hopes, we'll
add fish to the list.

BOOKS ON USAGE: WHOM DO YOU TRUST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's your favorite usage authority? I asked last week, having
concluded that Strunk &AMP; White's ``Elements of Style,'' almost
unrevised in its new edition, was doomed, left to fossilize by the
road as history marches past.
</P>
<P>
   I vaguely expected some consensus _ perhaps a plurality for
``Woe Is I,'' Patricia O'Conner's 1996 usage guide. But just as
Boston women don't buy their hats, but have their hats, usage-book
lovers seem to stand by their old reliables. Readers named books
from the '90s and books from the '50s, books familiar and obscure,
but only a handful of titles got more than one mention. One of them
was indeed ``Woe Is I,'' a modern Strunk &AMP; White with a sense of
humor and a dose of historical perspective. O'Conner knows when to
break the reductive Strunkian rules and when to admit that a
once-banned usage has become standard. Her chapter laying to rest
``The Living Dead'' _ those injunctions against hosting parties,
splitting infinitives, and using since for because _ is a model of
common sense. ``O'Conner makes you laugh, even if you're not
agreeing with her,'' wrote reader Beth David.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Conner shares the field with an even newer contender,
Becky Burckmyer's ``Why Does My Boss Hate My Writing?'' This is a
fine little book, despite the subtitle (added, no doubt, by some
marketing genius) that promises to help ``improve your writing 100
percent.'' Ignore it: Despite her utilitarian goal, Burckmyer
writes easily and winningly, though always erring on the side of
caution. You may know it's OK to split an infinitive, but if your
boss _ or your customer _ is less enlightened, you'll lose points
for it anyway, she notes. Burckmyer also gives some basic rhetoric
lessons _ how to compose an apology, how to deliver good news or
bad _ that are handy for real life as well as office life.
</P>
<P>
   There were good reviews, too, for William Zinsser's ``On Writing
Well'' and Claire Kehrwald Cook's ``Line by Line: How to Edit Your
Own Writing.'' ``Extremely well organized, with a good index,''
wrote Susan Shipley of Jamaica Plain of Cook's book. (The newer
edition, presumably seeking a wider audience, has changed ``Edit''
to ``Improve'' in the subtitle.) I have only a nodding acquaintance
with Zinsser, and hadn't heard of Cook, but I'll be taking another
look at both.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I've seen enough of Karen Elizabeth Gordon,
who writes the kind of books for which the term ``flight of fancy''
was coined. ``The Deluxe Transitive Vampire,'' for instance, is a
sampler of English constructions, dense with gargoyles and puns,
showing . . . I'm not sure what. But Philip Madell, who sent along
his glowing published review of ``Vampire,'' is a fan, and you
might be too.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might not _ and that's probably one reason so many people
stick with the guidebooks they know. Most usage writers are
covering the same territory, after all; what you're looking for is
someone whose voice you like, whose judgment you trust, whose
indexer has corralled all the references to issues you care about.
</P>
<P>
   But checking out the candidates is no easy proposition. Even a
good bookstore will have only a few usage books at any given time.
The online booksellers have dozens, but the reviews _ when they
exist _ aren't very helpful: You may despise a title beloved of
Arlene in Arkansas or Patience in Philly. (One new usage book, well
and widely reviewed, turned out to have long passages in blindingly
tiny sans-serif type; worse, its author used the phrase ``wax on
about'' as if it were standard. Say it isn't so . . .)
</P>
<P>
   What on-line customers really need is not reviews but a sample
page from each offering on the seller's Web site. One of the more
pretentious of the pretenders to Strunk &AMP; White's throne _ a book
called ``Adios, Strunk and White'' _ does have a long excerpt on
Amazon.com, and it's a revelation. The blurbs promise ``a mosaic of
brilliant techniques'' and _ more ominously _ an explanation of
``how to achieve writing notions.'' But the authors' own words tell
all: Their prose is pedestrian, their terminology gimmicky
(Time-warping! Layering! Uncorking!) and their grasp of etymology
shaky (``ossified in stone''). After a minute, it was adios forever
to ``Adios, Strunk and White.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were always that easy, I would buy _ I hope _ a lot more
usage books. But until the booksellers figure it out, I'll be
relying on your recommendations, and waiting eagerly for more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's not easy to raise your kids in a language that
few people speak. But Michael Katz and Linda Gritz reaped their
reward this summer. When their 10-year-old daughter, Pauline, wrote
them a letter from overnight camp, they could hardly believe what
they were reading. Ikh hob geshriben tsu buba. Kenst du shriben tsu
mir, zizegute? (``I wrote to Grandma. Can you write to me please?''
Pauline wrote, using an English-based alphabet and a confident if
not word-perfect Yiddish, and signing it with her Yiddish name,
Perl.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited!'' exclaimed her mother, a scientist at a
biotech company. ``I was kvelling (beaming with pride) the rest of
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz and Gritz are among a tiny handful of English-speaking
couples in Massachusetts teaching their children to speak Yiddish,
the language of their East European Jewish forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching children a second language might not seem remarkable _
except in the case of this particular second language. It is true
that Yiddish _ whose components are German, Hebrew, Aramaic,
Slavic, and the Romance languages _ has a lot to offer, as
languages go. It is rich, evocative, and colorful. With a
1,000-year history, it holds the key to a lost Eastern European
lifestyle and its traditions and culture. It's great for imitations
and punch lines, lending it a ``tremendous non-Jewish appeal,''
says Hankus Netsky of the Boston-based Klezmer Conservatory Band.
``It's ironic, it's catchy, it's exotic.''
</P>
<P>
   But useful Yiddish is not. The reality is that Yiddish, which
was spoken by nearly 10 million people before World War II, was all
but eradicated as a daily language by the Holocaust and by the
assimilation of Jewish immigrants. Few would dispute that its
heyday has come and gone, despite a recent revival of interest by
academics and performers. (Witness the recent release of the album
``Mamaloshen'' by performer Mandy Patinkin, featuring a Yiddish
version of ``Take Me out to the Ball Game.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, you won't see street signs in Yiddish very often, or find
a ``recent Yiddish titles'' section at your local bookstore, or
overhear a fluent Yiddish conversation in the neighborhood _ unless
the speakers happen to be elderly, or are among those Hasidic Jews
who have held on to the language as the vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Katz and Gritz and other like-minded parents, raising their
children to speak Yiddish is not about nostalgia.We're not talking
about parents passing along a Yiddish phrase here or there, or
teaching the kids how to differentiate between a schlemiel and a
schlimazel. These parents are establishing Yiddish as the dominant
language of their homes, or making it at least as important as
English.
</P>
<P>
   They may send their children to a Yiddish-oriented summer camp
(Camp Kinderland in Tolland, which Pauline Katz is attending) or
plan their vacations around organized Yiddish events, with other
families: Next week, for example, the Katz-Gritz family will spend
time at a weeklong annual Yiddish retreat in Copake, N.Y., called
Yidish-Vokh (Yiddish Week). They may organize Yiddish play groups
for their children and get creative about inventing games,
converting ``Duck duck, goose,'' for example, to katchkele,
katchkele, genzele. They may even give the family pet a Yiddish
name, as have Mark David and Debbie Ellerin parents of two children
and a pug they call Zisi (``Sweetie'').
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is: Why? The answer would seem to
be: Why not? Some parents, like David and Ellerin, say they want
their children to be multilingual, and one reason they favor
Yiddish is because it is ``a great key to so much culture that's
normally encoded,'' says David, a software developer who also hosts
a weekly Yiddish radio show in Boston called ``The Yiddish Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Others grew up with Yiddish and want to keep it alive in their
families. ``My parents spoke it when they didn't want me to
understand, and then I understood,'' says Shifra Rosenthal, a nurse
and mother of two children, aged 4 and 16 months. ``I just love the
language.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yiddish is the major language of our families and was the most
beautiful aspect of our childhoods,'' says Rakhmiel Peltz, formerly
of Northampton, Mass. and more recently of Philadelphia. He and his
wife, Hannah Kliger Peltz, have taught Yiddish to their children,
now 8 and 6, ``to make sure they had the same jewels as we had.
When I hear Yiddish, that is what beauty is.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are also ideological. Katz and Gritz, parents of
Pauline and Ben, 8, were first exposed to Yiddish as children in
New York Jewish schools and summer camps. Katz says he was
influenced by the work of Yiddish labor poets and fiction writers,
with their commitment to social justice. ``It's given me moral
guideposts'' in life, he says. And teaching the children Yiddish is
a way ofsmitting our culture, which happens to have skipped
a generation,'' says Katz, a theater technical director at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Neverthless, trying to raise modern kids to speak Yiddish is
``very challenging,'' David says. One reason is that there are few
people with whom to speak it. ``You really have to make an
effort,'' says Peggy Davis, who, together with her klezmer musician
husband, Joe Kurland, are raising their son, Aaron, 5, to speak
Yiddish. ``But in rural areas, it's twice as hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment to speaking Yiddish is that the language
stopped evolving about 50 years ago. How do you translate phrases
like ``disposable diapers?'' What's the Yiddish word for ``Burger
King''?
</P>
<P>
   (There are answers to these vocabulary dilemmas. New York
Yiddish scholar Mordkhe Schaechter has compiled a Yiddish-English
dictionary of childbirth and early childhood words. Entries include
the Yiddish words for ``breast pump,'' ``unwed mother,'' ``blow
bubbles,'' and ``don't take candy from a stranger.'')
</P>
<P>
   As far as Burger King goes, there are several solutions, David
says. You can be literal (cutlet meylekh, i.e., hamburger king);
make up a word; switch to English; or ``use English words lightly
Yiddishized,'' that is, speak the English words, but with a Yiddish
accent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are other quandaries: Is it fair to expect a high
level of Yiddish from children, given that few people will
understand them? Is the occasional Yinglish word permissible?
Should a parent let poor grammar slip by?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a different opinion. For Gritz and Katz, whose own
mostly textbook Yiddish is less than fluent, ``better a broken
Yiddish than no Yiddish'' is a reasonable rule of thumb. Others,
like Ben Schaechter of New York _ a native Yiddish speaker who runs
the Yidish-Vokh _ insist that children speak with perfect grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak only Yiddish to my kids, period,'' says Schaechter,
composer, pianist, and conductor of a Yiddish chorus who grew up in
a Yiddish-speaking home in New York. ``It's very important to
establish a language as the language of the home, and not speak it
just on Thursday or Shabbos or if it rains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If my daughter speaks English, we don't answer her, or we say,
redt af yidish,'' which means ``speak Yiddish,'' concurs Shifra
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   What if a child doesn't want to speak Yiddish? There's not much
you can do, parents say. Linda Gritz acknowledges that Pauline
``uses Yiddish mainly when I push her to, or when she wants
something special and knows she can soften my heart more'' if she
asks in Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been successful in being vigilant enough in
getting our kids to speak Yiddish,'' says Rakhmiel Peltz. ``When
our son started speaking, he answered us in English, and we
accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are the occasional rewards for all this effort,
such as that described by David. Noting that Yiddish was the secret
language for an earlier generation of Jews who didn't want their
American children to understand them, David spoke proudly of a
recent incident in his own family that showed how much things have
changed in just a few years. His children were in a car with their
aunt and were overheard plotting in Yiddish about how they were
going to get her to buy them a toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they speak Yiddish so the older people won't understand,''
laughed David. ``My sister came home and said she was kvelling.''

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The cop at the intersection of Carnegie and East 9th
looked as if he were escorting a prisoner to life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland Browns Stadium?'' he repeated an unsuspecting
motorist's question. ``Just keep going straight.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head, and his voice assumed a tone of utter pity.
``Good luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you say that?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' replied the officer, gesturing to the gridlock that
extended to Lake Erie on the horizon, ``that's where they're all
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 25,000 of them. Leaving work early last Tuesday afternoon
so they could be on hand by 5 o'clock sharp. For a preseason
practice. For their first look at the new Cleveland Browns, who
they fervently hope will be mistaken for the old Cleveland Browns,
a National Football League institution for 46 years before their
owner, the locally loathed Art Modell, uprooted them at the call of
a siren's song of riches and perks from Baltimore after the 1995
season.
</P>
<P>
   This franchise is truly a phenomenon, ``probably a one-time
situation,'' in the words of president and CEO Carmen Policy.
Indeed, it is doubtful any professional sports entity before or
after these Browns could describe itself as does director of
communications and public affairs Alex Martins: ``An expansion team
with a history.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because when Modell finally was bid good riddance on Feb.
8, 1996, all he got to take with him were the players who
constituted the previous Browns. Everything else belonged to
Cleveland: the name, the orange and brown team colors, the legacy
of a franchise that had sprung from Paul Brown's genius into the
short-lived All-American Football Conference in 1946 before
becoming an instant NFL dynasty four years later, and, most
important, a commitment from commissioner Paul Tagliabue that the
city would have a replacement, via either expansion or relocation,
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   What they were unveiling Tuesday was the result of the
unyielding leadership of Mayor Michael R. White, the cooperation of
the local business community, and, most of all, the ruckus raised
by a people's revolution that proved the big dog doesn't always
win, at least not against the Dawg Pound.
</P>
<P>
   So Chris Palmer, the 49-year-old former Boston University head
coach and Patriots assistant who was chosen as the field boss of
the new Browns, wasn't paying lip service when he observed, ``I'm
just a small part of what's happening. Really, it's the fans who
brought the team back.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that a sense of accomplishment and
self-congratulation engulfed Cleveland Browns Stadium _ such an
infant that its lakefront marquee proclaimed it the home of the
``CLEV LAND BROWN'' _ for the fans' first glimpse at the fruits of
their protest. The ballpark was the most obvious sign of revival
for those who survived the hourlong, 13-block, bumper-to-bumper
exhaust festival from Carnegie and East 9th and were lucky enough
to find a parking space in the municipal lots behind the Browns'
new digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put 6,700 cars in here,'' said Port of Cleveland
compliance manager Bob Dean as he manned a walkie-talkie along the
macadam shoreline. ``And we'll turn away twice that many: people
who don't have season tickets, curiosity seekers, and a few who
aren't even sure why they're down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they locked their vehicles, the patrons were dazzled by the
sight of the gleaming, $283 million, 73,200-seat steel-and-glass
oval that has sprouted on the very spot where once stood Cleveland
Stadium, the mausoleum that served as the foundation for Modell's
argument that he could no longer stay financially competitive with
his more lavishly housed rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The lie was put to that as the crowd streamed through the gates,
unable to wait for Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's more competitive introduction,
when the new Browns played their first game in Cleveland, a 24-17
exhibition loss to the Minnesota Vikings before a capacity crowd of
71,398.
</P>
<P>
   That was preceded by Friday's Welcome Home Browns parade along
Euclid Avenue in Public Square and a pep rally later in the
afternoon, the highlights of what the mayor declared to be Browns
Spirit Day. A crowd estimated at more than 30,000 saluted Browns of
the past ranging from Lou Groza to Bernie Kosar, hailed Browns of
the present such as Jerry Ball, paid tribute to their own efforts,
and trashed the preceding administration by purchasing the ``MODELL
SUCKS!'' T-shirts that were in abundant supply.
</P>
<P>
   And when darkness descended Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, downtown became an
enormous beacon, the skyline lighting up, per request of the mayor,
to illuminate the fact that the Browns are back.
</P>
<P>
   Some had been ready to trumpet that fact since the night before.
Municipal parking lot attendants reported that tailgating among the
particularly ravenous began at 1 a.m. _ 17 hours before game time _
while others started early Saturday serving as joyous counterpoint
to the Ku Klux Klan rally that commandeered several nearby city
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Latecomer Tim Franck was among a woozy crowd from Wooster, an
hour south, that had set up grills and coolers in a lot a
quarter-mile from the stadium at 9:30 a.m. Franck, a 48-year-old
paintbrush salesman, surveyed the vehicles _ many of them done up
in Browns colors and sporting some form of team insignia _ in the
lot and said, ``You want to know how you can tell the Browns are
back? You look around here and it's the same people in the same
places who've been here for 15 years. It's one big reunion. Three
years seems like two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Group leader Roger Veberba, a 38-year-old construction worker
from Maple Heights who bills himself as the Mayor of the Muni Lot,
had been partying since before 8 a.m. but promised not to wait
until the last minute to toast the regular-season opener against
the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night, Sept. 12. ``We'll be here
Friday,'' he said. He was serious.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of these revelers had been among Tuesday's faithful, most
of whom were getting their first taste of the new building's
innards, though some had been here the previous weekend for the
debut tour, part of a drive against hunger that required a can of
food as the price of admission. Motivated as much by anticipation
as altruism, some 100,000 donors passed through the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   For Tuesday's workout, which featured a bare minimum of all-out
contact, special deluxe-sized tickets labeled ``Sneak Preview'' _ a
misnomer if ever there was one _ were mailed to the club's 62,000
season ticket-holders. Those who partook were advised to keep their
tickets for posterity; the ushers were tearing no stubs from the
sacred artifacts. There were, however, plenty of chances to spend
money. Merchandising stands throughout the stadium were doing a
land-office business; the No. 2 jersey of the Browns' _ and the
NFL's _ first draft choice last spring, quarterback Tim Couch, was
a particularly hot item in the 87-degree weather. Extra-large $5
beers, in keepsake plastic mugs with a Browns helmet on the front
and schedule on the back, were available at the swamped concession
stands, and some thirsty supporters carried around stacks of them,
like babushka dolls.
</P>
<P>
   But the product that had brought out the masses was down on the
field. The Browns players, dressed in their Halloween-treat
uniforms, were accorded a standing ovation, the three-year hiatus
finally over, once they could be coaxed out of their plush
surroundings. ``The players were in awe of the locker room,'' said
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   They were in awe of the support, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' said Couch, gazing around at the
adulation sprinkled through every section and in some of the 148
luxury boxes priced at $50,000-$125,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Browns set foot on the Kentucky bluegrass, their first
act was to return the favor. Like the cavalry, they trooped behind
the south end zone to the Dawg Pound, that notorious section where
kennelmates in years past would cheer the home team and rattle the
visitors with mock barking, throwing their passion and occasional
projectiles into each well-lubricated Sunday afternoon. Defensive
backs Corey Fuller and Tim McTyer applied the touchy-feely theme of
the day literally, leaping the 7-foot barrier in front of the
stands to slap five with some of the Dawgs in the front row of the
orange aluminum bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally different,'' said cornerback Antonio Langham, a
once and present Brown who had worn the team colors for the
surreal, funereal farewell of the Modell regime on Dec. 17, 1995.
``It feels so good to hear the screaming and the hollering.''
</P>
<P>
   All for an otherwise routine scrimmage, offense against defense,
in which each numbingly regimented and repetitive exercise was
announced over the public address system: ``The next segment will
be nine-on-seven drills consisting of 15 plays.'' The only
semblance of combat occurred during full-contact goal-line plays
for the final five minutes of the two-hour session, and a
high-decibel roar arose when former Patriots afterthought Sedric
Shaw cracked through the middle for the first touchdown on third
and 1.

GOVERNOR BUSH, CONSIDER THE CASE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let's consider the stance of George W. Bush as
lock-'em-all-up tough guy. And let's apply his implacable hostility
to possessors and users of cocaine to a really bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sherlock Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know he never existed and was written into
turn-of-the-century London when the stuff was legal (here, too, by
the way). But the alleged wisdom of the governor's no-exceptions
sternness has to be apparent in all cases, hypothetical and
retroactive, or it makes no sense. Holmes is an appropriate
subject, not to excuse drug use but to understand it; using Sigmund
Freud, by contrast, would tax Governor Bush's reasoning powers
unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine Bush landing like a ton of bricks on a modern
incarnation of the greatest of all detectives, whom Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle portrayed as a guy with something of a habit that
affected no one but himself and was indulged regularly but not
constantly. Remember, you could find millions of Americans who do
or have done that, often when they were making ``mistakes'' as
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dr. John Watson's narration, we learn that Holmes was a
user when he was in between cases. In the early story ``A Scandal
in Bohemia,'' Doyle's Watson refers to Holmes's ``cold, precise,
but admirably balanced mind . . . the most perfect reasoning and
observing machine that the world has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that in his down time, Holmes was holed up on
Baker Street, ``alternating from week to week between cocaine and
ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his
own keen nature.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit later, in ``The Yellow Face,'' a disapproving Dr. Watson
said of the great man: ``Save for the occasional use of cocaine he
had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against
the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers
uninteresting.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ominous description begins ``The Sign of the Four,''
when Watson comes upon Holmes shooting up, which the doctor says he
has been doing three times a day for many months in this period.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine or cocaine? he asks. The latter, replies Holmes,
offering some to Dr. Watson, calling it ``a seven percent
solution'' (hence the title of the second-rate movie decades
later).
</P>
<P>
   Watson berates himself for not ojecting more strenuously but
makes his point, which Holmes takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one,'' he
says. ``I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and
clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter or
small moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But consider the cost,'' argues Dr. Watson. . . . Why should
you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great
powers with which you have been endowed?''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes counters that it's no big deal, because when his mind is
attacking difficult problems, ``I can dispense with artificial
stimulation.''
</P>
<P>
   So should our modern Holmes be locked up for felony possession?
Or should Doyle's works be banned from school and public libraries
as dangerous propaganda? Should tolerance in British detective
yarns be limited to Agatha Christie, who in ``The Labors of
Hercule'' is more careful to note that in addition to exhilaration,
``take too much of it and you get violent mental excitement,
delusions and delirium''?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, and I'd bet Bush would agree.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Felony possession, in practice, is not a charge aimed at the
discreet or at well-off, well-connected young people making
mistakes. It's a bullet aimed at poor kids on the street, more
often black or Hispanic kids; in practice the bullet's purpose is
to force users to give up suppliers, but that doesn't blot out the
fact that by the thousands people languish in prison who have never
posed any threat to any law-abiding citizen. Many of them need help
and want desparately to stop using, but jail cells outnumber
treatment program slots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's weird behavior to date has nothing to do with his
qualifications to be president, no matter what he did 'twixt 18 and
28, any more than Holmes's admitted using of cocaine affected his
ability to be a brilliant problem-solver. But Bush's selective
claims and selective silence knock the legs out from under his
ability to discuss an extremely serious problem in this country
without evoking legitimate snickers. And hypocrisy lurks in the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary.

EUROPE'S GREENS TAKING POWER, SET CENTRIST COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Last month, when Belgium's newly installed
transportation minister, Isabelle Durant, was informed that she was
entitled to a sporty BMW sedan, she politely declined the perk.
</P>
<P>
   Like other environmentalists who have taken power across Europe,
Durant has compromised on some things but she draws the line at
driving a gas-guzzler, even if it comes free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly but inexorably, the so-called ``Green'' parties of
Europe, once considered part of the radical fringe, are becoming
more mainstream and gaining power throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the so-called 68'ers, radicals who led and took part in
the student uprisings of the late 1960s, have left the communes of
yesteryear for the committee rooms of today. Leaving behind an
uncompromising ideology, often born of youthful idealism, they have
found influence by engaging in the give-and-take of pragmatic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was most responsible for the change, Niki
Kortvelyessy, a leading member of the Brussels-based European
Federation of Green Parties, said, only half-jokingly, ``It's
called reaching middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aims have not changed. The strategies have changed,'' she
said. ``If the Greens have been about anything, it's about change.
You can make more change in government, but there's a price to be
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that price is compromising when the bigger coalition
partners balk at shutting down nuclear power plants or lowering
speed limits. By agreeing to compromise, however, more Greens are
gaining positions of authority rather than being consigned to the
margins of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Greens are primarily environmentalists, their
platform encompasses pacifism and a social agenda that is decidedly
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   And their ascent has been relatively swift. The British Green
Party, Europe's first, was founded in 1973, but most European
environmentalist parties were not formed until the 1980s. It was
not until 1984 that European Green parties organized themselves in
a loose federation, and it was not until 1993 that a Green party
member sat in a government Cabinet. Today, 12 countries in the
15-member European Union have Green parties.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they sit in five coalition governments _ Finland, the
first country to have a Green Cabinet member, Belgium, France,
Italy and, most prominently, Germany, Europe's biggest country.
Outside the EU, they have made gains this year in eastern Europe,
with Cabinet ministers in Poland and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Greens upped their numbers in the 626-member European
Parliament from 27 to 47. In the elections, the Greens doubled
their vote in Britain, France, and the Netherlands, and they
dramatically increased their share of the vote everywhere except in
Germany and Italy, where it fell slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Michaele Schreyer, a German environmentalist, is
expected to be confirmed as the first Green to sit on the 20-member
European Commission, which oversees the administration of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   As they leave the fringes, however, the Greens have had to
compromise on some sacred tenets. In Germany, for example, the
Greens had to swallow hard when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
refused their demands for the immediate mothballing of all nuclear
power plants. Instead, they settled for vague commitments from
Schroeder to phase out nuclear power. Greens have had to be
similarly patient in France, where their newfound clout has led to
the closing of just one of the country's 57 nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   But it was NATO's war against Yugoslavia that presented the
pacifist Greens with their biggest dilemma, and also showed just
how much the 68'ers and other former radicals who now lead the
Green parties have changed.
</P>
<P>
   One of those 68'ers is Joschka Fischer, who as Germany's foreign
minister is arguably the world's most powerful Green. Hitherto a
pacifist, Fischer said his attitude about using force changed after
the Serb massacre of civilians at Srebrenica in Bosnia in 1995. He
emerged as one of Europe's staunchest defenders of using force
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. But he barely
managed to hold his Green Party together over the war, which marked
the first time since the end of World War II that German forces
were engaged in combat.
</P>
<P>
   If Fischer's personal journey personifies how former radicals
have become current establishment figures, so, too, does the
odyssey of Daniel ``Danny the Red'' Cohn-Bendit. A leader of the
student revolt of May 1968 in Paris, Cohn-Bendit has mellowed with
age and since 1994 has served in the European Parliament as one of
Germany's Green representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years after he was expelled from France for his
activism, Cohn-Bendit coordinated the Green campaign in France for
the European election, which saw the French Greens double their
vote. At 54, he still insists nuclear power must be phased out, and
that some drugs should be legalized. But he speaks approvingly of
the European Central Bank, accepts the necessity of immigration
limits, and advocates raising the retirement age to 70.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of former radicals mellowing, the Greens are
also throwing their weight around. Earlier this month, after the
European Union lifted a three-year ban on British beef imposed
because of ``mad cow'' disease, German Health Minister Andrea
Fischer, a Green, refused to lift that country's prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, a Green parliamentarian, Magda Aelvot, was named
health minister last month and promptly launched a crackdown on
contaminated food. The lack of decisive action by the previous
government in the face of a report of cancer-causing dioxins in
animal feed was widely cited as the reason Jean-Luc Dehaene was
booted out as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The growing influence of Greens in government makes it likely
that trade wars between the United States and the European Union
will become more common. The Greens have led European opposition to
the import of US beef from hormone-treated livestock and to the
testing of genetically-modified crops, most of them produced by
US-based multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   There are limits to Green power, however, as the German Greens
learned when they tried to muscle their much larger coalition
partners, Schroeder's Social Democrats. And France's Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, a socialist, refused to give in to demands from his
Green environment minister, Dominique Voynet, for a general amnesty
for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the Greens had to decide whether to withdraw
their support from the government on principle, or retain their
influence and fight another day. Increasingly, Greens are choosing
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   To some, that means sellout. Green party officials believe the
drop in their vote in Germany and Italy in the European elections
was a rebuke from longstanding supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are grass-roots fundamentalists who expect the world to
change overnight because the Greens have gotten into government,''
said Kevin Saunders, a leading member of the British Green Party.
``They don't understand why they're not living in a green utopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders says most European Greens have a more patient,
realistic view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compromise has got to be part of politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all their newfound pragmatism, Greens are still prone to
stand on principle, no matter how much it embarrasses the
government. In Austria last week, a leading Green, Peter Pilz,
lambasted the government for allowing a top aide to Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein to obtain medical treatment in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   While Pilz catalogued Izzat Ibrahim al-Durri's alleged
involvement in mass killings of Kurds in northern Iraq, and filed a
complaint seeking his arrest, an embarrassed Austrian government
acknowledged it had granted a one-month visa for humanitarian
reasons and said Ibrahim had diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed of the Austrian government,'' Pilz said. ``The
country is becoming a paradise for mass murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   As Europe increasingly becomes a region without economic
borders, the Greens are also emerging as the leading opponents to
the creation of large markets that exploit economies of scale,
seeing the movement of food and products over long distances as a
needless waste of gasoline and a threat to the small, local shops
where most Europeans do their shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a turning point,'' said Saunders. ``One of the things
Green parties across the world are working for is a closer
relationship between the consumer and the producer, the whole idea
of getting markets closer to people. Why ship cauliflower halfway
across Europe when you can get it grown locally? This is about
revitalizing communities, it's about saving the local shop from
being swallowed up by the supermarkets. It's moving back 40 or 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that sounds more reactionary than radical, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now we're radical conservatives,'' he said.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH STIR CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTUNE, Prince Edward Island _ The big trout in the green tank
are voracious eaters, their pink mouths wide open with anticipation
as they swarm beneath their automatic feeding tray. Every time the
tray drops new food pellets, the water becomes a mad splash of
writhing fish.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them for being hungry? They are growing boys and
girls, genetically programmed to grow about eight times faster than
normal during the first year of their lives. Compared to the
skinny, ordinary trout swimming in the next tank, these 18-inch
fish are giants among Lilliputians.
</P>
<P>
   This is ground zero in what supporters are calling ``the blue
revolution'' that could soon sweep the fishing industry _ and the
world's dinner plates. By inserting extra genes into fish, the
would-be revolutionaries hope to conquer the last wild frontier in
the food supply, creating fish that grow faster, live in colder
waters, and even fight off disease better than the ones Mother
Nature produces.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Massachusetts-based company that owns this
hatchery, A/F Protein, is gearing up for large-scale production of
fast-growing trout and Atlantic salmon. Worldwide, researchers have
found the genetic keys to rapid growth in at least 11 commercially
valuable fish species, including shrimp growing at the University
of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But, before the first genetically altered smoked salmon hit the
market, the fledgling industry is caught in the rising controvery
over genetic tinkering with the food supply. Critics warn that the
lab-created fish could escape and damage wild fish stocks, while
consumers worry that genetically altered food of all kinds may not
be healthy or tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move aquaculture into a better direction than it
has right now,'' said Boyce Thorne-Miller of SeaWeb, a
Washington-based advocacy group that criticizes aquaculture for
polluting coastal waters with concentrated fish feces. Genetic
engineering, she fears, ``could make things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the new industry say the fears are misplaced,
promising that their fish will be as wholesome as conventional
fish, just more abundant. They also plan precautions to prevent
genetically altered fish from upsetting the balance of nature, such
as neutering the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the amount of misinformation and
emotional reactions that are not based on science,'' said Elliot
Entis, chief executive of A/F Protein, whose corporate headquarters
is in Waltham. ``Our position is that our fish are basically
unchanged in all respects from the wild fish. What we have done is
really a juggling of the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, controversy over genetically modified food, including
attacks on crops in Europe, is taking a toll. New England salmon
farmers, growers of the region's third most valuable seafood, have
shown little interest in genetically altered salmon, fearing that
they, too, could be drawn into the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without knowing a lot more about it, I think the consuming
public would have difficulties with a genetically engineered
salmon,'' said Michael Hastings, director of the Maine Aquaculture
Innovations Center, an industry research group. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Marking a milestone &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the advent of genetically altered fish marks a
milestone in the history of food. Nearly every other food group,
from meat to vegetables to fruit, has been cross-bred almost beyond
recognition after millennia of human agriculture. Fish, by
contrast, are mostly harvested from the wild, shaped only by the
forces of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But a rising human population has decimated the world's fishing
grounds, increasing pressure to more intensively manage the fishing
industry. Japan tried in the 1980s to create genetically superior
``superfish,'' including a tuna that researchers hoped might swim
to the net when it is ready for market.
</P>
<P>
   However, the quest for the superfish proved more difficult and
time consuming than many had hoped, both because genetics is so
complex and because species such as salmon take years to reach
sexual maturity. Today, although nearly 20 percent of the world's
fish and shellfish come from aquaculture, none, with the possible
exception of fish sold in mainland China, have been genetically
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inside a modest fish hatchery between the lobster boats and
potato fields of rural Prince Edward Island, the West may be closer
than ever to a commercially available superfish. A/F Protein
officials hope to test their fish in ocean pens next summer and, if
they win US and Canadian regulatory approval, begin selling
genetically altered salmon and trout by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the researchers who started A/F Protein were not
trying to make fish grow when they began in the mid-1970s. They
were trying to understand how flounder survive in frigid Canadian
waters that would kill salmon; but, it turned out that the same
gene that allows flounder to survive the cold could be combined
with a second gene to speed growth as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to boost growth by 20 to 30 percent, Garth Fletcher, a
fish biologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Choy Hew
of the University of Toronto injected the salmon embryo with a gene
that promotes antifreeze production along with a gene for making
salmon growth hormone. Together, the genes programmed the salmon to
produce growth hormone continuously, and to produce it in two
organs rather than the normal one.
</P>
<P>
   To the researchers' surprise, the salmon grew 400 to 600 percent
faster during their first 14 months. The combination also worked on
other fish, including rainbow trout that grew 8 to 10 times faster
than normal in their first year.
</P>
<P>
   And, although these fish needed more oxygen and food than
ordinary fish, they were big enough to go to market up to a year
earlier as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as fantastic. The growth rates and the cost of
production of the genetically modified fish are in no way
comparable to regular fish,'' said Sefton Dixon, a Prince Edward
Island salmon farmer who recently formed a company called OvaTech
with five other fish farmers to distribute A/F Protein's
genetically modified fish as soon as they are available.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government has backed genetic engineering of fish
as well, funding the research, and sending government officials to
public events such as taste tests designed to show that genetically
altered fish taste fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian enthusiasm has not been matched on the US side of
the border, where aquaculture companies face more scrutiny and
criticism in part because more people live on the coast. Although
Entis of A/F Protein spoke to Maine salmon growers in 1995, fish
farmers have been reluctant to commit to a technology that could
bring them unwanted publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of my farmers have told me that they want me to put out a
request for proposals on engineered salmon. They've got a lot of
other problems that are a lot higher priority,'' said Hastings of
the Maine Aquaculture Innovations Center. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Flood of critics &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, genetic engineering of fish faces a steady stream of
criticism ranging from groups such as Greenpeace that oppose it to
developing nations that fear the technology will help the
industrialized world at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Goldburg of the Environmental Defense Fund, for
instance, has warned that genetically altered fish could be so
tough that they out-compete wild fish for limited food and spawning
areas. Alternately, the fish could interbreed with wild fish,
changing their genetic makeup in unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   Several observers fear that the new fish could cause allergic
reactions or other unexpected side effects for consumers that
regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration could easily
miss.
</P>
<P>
   But A/F Protein hatchery manager Arnie Sutterlin, over a
breakfast of genetically engineered smoked salmon, said people will
soon learn they have nothing to fear. ``I cannot tell the
difference and I've eaten literally 20 pounds of the stuff,'' he
said. ``They're just like other fish. They just grow up faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither US nor Canadian regulators have raised concerns about
the safety of the new fish so far. Canadian government-funded
studies of the genetically altered salmon have found that they
appear, swim, and behave like ordinary salmon, except that they eat
and breathe a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, A/F Protein officials are trying to ease public edginess
by promising to label genetically altered products and using only
fish genes in their research rather than the mouse and bacteria
genes that some have used. In addition, they expect the FDA to
insist on conditions to prevent the fish from escaping, such as
enclosed tanks or fish that cannot reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one can guarantee that these protections will
work. Fish farmers are unlikely to support expensive indoor tanks
instead of the ocean nets they use now, Sutterlin said, and the
pressure treatment to neuter salmon sometimes produces defects such
as deformed jaws or poor ocean survival.
</P>
<P>
   Even if A/F Protein's fish can be grown safely, critics
conclude, this is the start of a whole new field that has attracted
research institutes from Baltimore's Christopher Columbus Center to
the University of Connecticut's Biotechnology Research Program. As
the number and type of genetic manipulations increase, they say
risks could multiply.
</P>
<P>
   But A/F Protein officials are counting on public doubts to fade
over time, much as apprehension about eating salmon raised on fish
farms did in the 1980s. Then, genetic engineering of fish could
become just one more unnoticed tool for managing the human food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer has no idea where their food comes
from,'' said Sutterlin. ``The chicken comes from the jungle fowl of
Asia. It's got the texture of manila rope. All of the food we eat
has been manipulated'' over the centuries. Soon, he hopes, we'll
add fish to the list.

SOME THOUGHTS FOR YOUR PENNIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The penny has many enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Bot, 32, a psychologist from Toronto, occasionally
drops a penny and chooses not to pick it up because it ``isn't
worth the trip.'' Eighteen-year-old Eben Ellertson, a college
student, blithely listens to them rattle up the vaccuum cleaner
tube. And then there is Melissa Ceurvels, 25, who has been known to
throw out a penny because it was ``sticky.''
</P>
<P>
   It's characters like these _ capricious youngsters striding over
pennies, building up 10-year stockpiles or tossing them out car
windows _ who have taken so many coins out of circulation that the
US Mint this spring was forced to increase its penny production by
33 percent over 1997 rates.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston sent letters
to banks asking them to drop surcharges for customers who want to
redeem unrolled pennies for more substantial denominations, said
bank spokesman Thomas Lavelle.
</P>
<P>
   While laypeople typically refer to this as a ``penny shortage,''
the US Mint prefers to call it a ``unusually high penny demand'' _
evidence, in other words, that the penny remains a crucial part of
the economy. But critics of the penny say the circulation crisis,
like the ``take a penny'' dishes that have proliferated next to
cash registers across the nation, is a sign that the coin is
becoming more trouble than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a penny is used in a transaction, it's a one-way
transaction,'' said James Benfield, executive director of the
Washington-based Coin Coalition and a longtime penny critic. ``In
other words, it sits in a jug at home. If there were really a need
for a penny on the market, it wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer's penny crisis hit New York City hard after a flood
of cash transactions over the Fourth of July weekend. During the
worst of it, some desperate New York retailers were rounding off
all purchases down to the nearest nickel. By comparison, New
England has not been seriously affected, and in the days since the
letter went out to New England banks, coin supply has already begun
to build back up to normal levels, Lavelle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ebb and flow to these things. I know I, and perhaps
you, on occasion get lethargic about pennies,'' he said. ``It's an
interesting, quirky situation, but this is not problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   But this summer penny crunch, like earlier ones in 1981 and
1994, suggests that hoarding can cause serious problems for the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Coinstar, a Bellevue, Wash. company that
manufactures coin-counting machines, suggests that the lack of
respect for the penny is generational. The June survey found that
47 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 had thrown
away a penny at least once in their lives, compared to only 11
percent of Americans over 65. Twelve percent of Americans surveyed
said they would not pick up a penny from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That the penny has become a lowly-regarded currency was brought
home recently to Gerry Noonan a spokesman for the Connecticut
Bankers' Association, when he bragged to his 22-year-old son about
finding some coins on the floor of his garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Oh, Dad, nobody picks up pennies anymore. I only
pick up dimes and quarters,''' Noonan said. ``And I think when the
members of the Federal Reserve are a little younger, they might do
away with the penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Coinstar, an 8-year-old company, has capitalized on America's
hoarding ways. The company was founded by a business school
graduate who had stared too long at his own jar of unsorted coins.
</P>
<P>
   For an 8.9 percent service fee, Coinstar machines located mostly
in supermarkets will roll coins into the paper wrappers banks will
accept _ a time-consuming task usually foisted on young children.
</P>
<P>
   Working from their estimate that Americans are hoarding $7.7
billion worth of change, the company has capitalized to the tune of
$142 million in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a service that's taken off,'' said Michelle Avila,
a spokeswoman for the company. ``Sometimes people balk at the
service fee, but if your time is worth more than $1 or $2 an hour,
it's probably worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the penny's future came up in 1989 when Congress
considered legislation to abolish the penny, but never acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   Benfield, whose Coin Coalition is backed in part by the
vending-machine industry, says the main proponents of keeping the
penny come from the zinc industry and the US Mint, which still
sells pennies to the Federal Reserve for more than it costs to
manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the penny say doing away with it would nudge up
prices for everyone and especially hurt the poor, who are more
likely to perform frequent small cash transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But Benfield calls himself ``a strong advocate of cent
pricing,'' and recommends that final trasactions ending in 1 or 2
cents be rounded down and those ending in 3 or 4 cents be rounded
up _ already common in US military stores overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in the future, Americans will say `We've had
enough of this silliness,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to phasing out the penny is as much emotional as
practical. Americans unlike many foreigners have never seen a coin
eliminated because of inflation, said coin experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's a great testimony to the political stability of
our country,'' said Bob Fichter, a spokesman for the Massachusetts
Bankers' Association. ``For years and years, we've had this coin,
whereas in places like Russia and Brazil they're deciding to reduce
the 100,000 ruble note to one ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   But symbolism doesn't mean much to the 20-somethings who pass
pennies by because they don't feel like bending overockets. Erik
Geagan 27, rendered swift judgment on the coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Useless,'' he said, without pausing. ``It's a currency I feel
you should do without.''

FORECASTERS PREDICT SURGE IN HURRICANES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurricane Bret was just the beginning. Specialists in hurricane
forecasting agree that this year is likely to produce more
hurricanes than average, and perhaps four severe ones (those at
least as powerful as Bret) instead of the two seen in an average
year.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the specialists say next year may be just as bad. In
fact, people on the Atlantic Seaboard may have been lulled into a
false sense of security by three decades of unusually low hurricane
activity _ during which construction along vulnerable coastlines
has boomed as never before. As a result, the nation could be in for
coastal devastation that might dwarf that of any storm in history.
</P>
<P>
   But, the meteorologists stress, such long-term forecasting deals
with averages, and it is still impossible to be sure what kind of
hurricane activity will really occur in any given year. ``The
statistical indicators are mostly positive this year,'' said Kerry
Emanuel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology atmospheric
scientist and hurricane specialist, indicating that it is likely
there will be more than the annual average of six hurricanes, with
two of them major (winds over 111 miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.
</P>
<P>
   William Gray, a Colorado State University meteorologist whose
team makes one of the few detailed, annual predictions of hurricane
activity, expects that this year there will be nine hurricanes,
four of them major. Forecasters at Florida State University, headed
by climate scientist Jim Eisner, agree with that prediction, and
say that next year will produce similar elevated numbers; as part
of an experimental five-year forecast, they say the following two
years will be below average, followed by another highly active year
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   While no other groups are willing to go as far out on a limb
with long-term predictions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's National Hurricane Center also agrees with the
forecast that this year will produce more hurricanes than average.
</P>
<P>
   But, Emanuel cautioned, in all such predictions ``there is a
large margin of error. It could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the expectation of high activity in the Atlantic
this year is the fact that the El Nino/La Nina cycle, which relates
to the amount of warm water in the eastern equatorial Pacific, is
now squarely in the La Nina phase. This part of the cycle,
characterized by cooler than usual Pacific water, is typically
associated with heavy hurricane years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this correlation is quite strong, according to a new
analysis by Roger Pielke of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research and Christopher Landsea of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, which will be published in October in
the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that in most La Nina years (17 out of 22, or 77
percent), hurricanes have struck the US coast to produce over $1
billion in damage. Far fewer El Nino years (only 7 of 22, or 32
percent) have had storms that did so much damage.
</P>
<P>
   Some climate scientists say this association arises because in
El Nino years, high-level winds tend to be stronger, causing the
tops of storms to be sheared away before they can strengthen, while
in La Nina years such winds are weak. But Emanuel said that while
the statistical connection is clear, the reasons for it are ``a lot
of speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Pielke said that such statistics are unlikely to be
of much value for coastal dwellers: Nobody should cancel insurance
or move away just because of such statistical differences. But this
analysis could be significant both for the reinsurance industry and
for emergency planning officials, who can take extra steps to
prepare for the possibility of major storms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in anticipation of a heavier-than-usual hurricane
year, officials might set aside more money in emergency response
budgets. But, Pielke said, in years forecast to have low activity,
``I wouldn't do the opposite, because large losses are possible in
any year.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the total monetary damages, Pielke said, the
four-year period from 1991 to 1994 _ during which the devastating
hurricane Andrew struck Florida _ was actually the quietest such
period in this century. But the peak of recorded activity came just
on the heels of this quiet period. The total number of Atlantic
tropical storms from 1995 to 1998 was greater than any other
four-year period since records have been kept: 53 named storms,
with 32 hurricanes, even though 1997 was one of the quietest years.
</P>
<P>
   But the impacts vary by region. In Florida, Pielke said,
hurricanes from 1944 through 1950 produced more damage (adjusted
for inflation) than all the storms in the nearly half-century since
then _ including Andrew. And while the '95-'98 period spawned many
intense hurricanes, the strongest ones struck in the Caribbean or
in Central America, leaving US coastal dwellers unshaken in their
complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing in mind that many people living in coastal communities
have lived only in this unusually benign period and are not
accustomed to the kind of hurricane devastation that is typical
over the long term, Pielke recommended they ``prepare for the
past.'' In other words, people should expect an eventual return to
the stronger hurricane conditions that prevailed in the earlier
part of this century _ although Pielke himself is unsure of whether
the recent four-year period of intense activity represents the
beginning of that return, or just an anomalous break from the calm.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups support the forecast of a strong hurricane season
this year, as well as in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Joe D'Aleo, chief meteorologist for Weather Services
International in Billerica, Mass., noted that many of the major,
most memorable East Coast hurricanes of the past have come in La
Nina years like this one: The ``Great Hurricane'' of 1938, and
hurricanes Carol and Hazel in '54, Diane in '55, and Hugo in '89.
</P>
<P>
   Pielke stressed that people in coastal areas should prepare
themselves for a return to the conditions of greater hurricane
activity that occurred in the 1940s and '50s. ``We undoubtedly will
find that there are cycles and relationships'' that bring about
greater and lesser periods of hurricane activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, we've been lucky in recent years in the US,'' he
said. ``If it happened before, that's a pretty good indicator that
it can happen again.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After 35 years of liberal activism as a Democrat,
I am being urged by some people to spend 40 years of fame on a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing whatever value that fame might offer to serve
Rockefeller Republican Leadership in the Democratic Party is an
unacceptable option for me. I choose instead to weather the
cynicism toward ``bleeding heart celebrities'' and try to help
persuade the slightly more liberal one of the two accounting firms
we call our major parties to return to the principles of the
Democratic Party of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   I have no wish to diminish the capable, cautious centrists Al
Gore and Bill Bradley, who have unselfishly devoted much of their
lives to public service when they could so easily have enriched
themselves in the private sector, as I have.
</P>

   LOS ANGELES _ After 35 years of liberal activism as a Democrat,
I am being urged by some people to spend 40 years of fame on a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing whatever value that fame might offer to serve
Rockefeller Republican Leadership in the Democratic Party is an
unacceptable option for me. I choose instead to weather the
cynicism toward ``bleeding heart celebrities'' and try to help
persuade the slightly more liberal one of the two accounting firms
we call our major parties to return to the principles of the
Democratic Party of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   I have no wish to diminish the capable, cautious centrists Al
Gore and Bill Bradley, who have unselfishly devoted much of their
lives to public service when they could so easily have enriched
themselves in the private sector, as I have.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In November last year, unnamed CIA officials told The New York
Times that in 1995 they had compiled a large dossier on Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister. They sent the
material to Vice President Al Gore, co-chairman of the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, in which much of the
government-to-government business between the two countries was
handled.
 &HT;    It came back, said the officials, with what was described as ``a
barnyard epithet'' scrawled on it. The lesson they reportedly took
away was that evidence of high-level corruption was not wanted.
 &HT;    Thus, when they established that a German businessman had been
asked for $1 million to see Chernomyrdin, they did not circulate
the report.
 &HT;    But Chernomyrdin was for years a key interlocutor with Gore, the
man who seeks to prolong Democratic rule in the White House.
Dismissed by Boris Yeltsin as prime minister in March 1998,
Chernomyrdin is back now as president of Gazprom, the energy
monopoly he created and partially privatized and whose huge
revenues, vast holdings and large exemptions from taxes make it a
state within the Russian state.
 &HT;    Gore was deeply involved in Russian policy through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which dealt with economic, security
and scientific issues. He was a strong advocate of more aid and
assistance to Russia, harshly criticizing the World Bank and IMF's
reluctance to lend. He exhorted American business to invest in the
country and lauded Chernomyrdin, whose personal fortune, held
abroad, is estimated by Russian security sources in the billions of
dollars _ an allegation he denies.
 &HT;    When this checkered record is eventually held up to the light
during a presidential campaign, Gore will have much to answer for.
Already, these issues are boiling up in political circles. U.S.
politicians such as Curt Weldon, a Republican representative from
Pennsylvania, now barrage the administration with questions and
criticisms on their handling of Russia.
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state. Billions of dollars
of aid have poured into its reforms. Bitter struggles have been
waged between Russia's free-market radicals and their Communist or
nationalist foes, most significantly in 1993, when armed struggle
broke out between the Parliament and Yeltsin. Great privations have
been visited on the country in the name of necessary sacrifice.
Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better?
 &HT;    Russians, free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their
nation has shrunk _ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by
the people. The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of
the state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year of its
freedom, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it grew, at best, by less
than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially nonexistent in Soviet
times, is now officially 12 percent and may really be 25 percent.
Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.
 &HT;    Late at night in the office of Poland's finance minister, Sachs
had got on the phone and harangued American officials until they
promised to nudge the IMF into providing $1 billion in support for
the Polish currency. His myth as the economic liberator was born,
and with it a mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery. The young reformers in
Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way
forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.
 &HT;    Late at night in the office of Poland's finance minister, Sachs
had got on the phone and harangued American officials until they
promised to nudge the IMF into providing $1 billion in support for
the Polish currency. His myth as the economic liberator was born,
and with it a mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery. The young reformers in
Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way
forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On an insufferably muggy afternoon in July, with the thermometer
pushing 90 degrees and ozone alerts filling the airwaves, Alexander
Bregstein was in a foul mood.
 &HT;    He was furious, in fact, for reasons that would become clear
only later.
 &HT;    Working on just three hours of sleep, and having spent the last
eight hours minding a bunch of preschool kids in his summer job as
a camp counselor, Alexander was itching to kick back and relax.
 &HT;    So there he was, lying on his back in the weight room of his
gym, head down on an incline bench, earphones pitching three-figure
decibels of the rock band Finger Eleven into his ears as he gripped
an 85-pound weight in each hand and then, after a brief pause to
gather himself, muscled them into the air with focused bursts of
energy. Each lift was accompanied by a sharp exhalation, like the
quick, short stroke of a piston.
 &HT;    The first thing you need to know about Alexander is that he is
16 years old, bright, articulate and funny in that self-deprecating
and almost wise teen-age way. However, about a year ago, Alexander
made a conscious decision that those weren't the qualities he
wanted people to recognize in him, at least not at first.
 &HT;    He wanted people to see him first, and what they see these days
are thick neck muscles, shoulders so massive that he can't scratch
his back, a powerful bulge in his arms and a chest that has been
deliberately chiseled for the two-button look _ what Alexander now
calls ``my most endearing feature.''
 &HT;    He walks with a kind of cocky gravity-testing bounce in his step
that derives in part from his muscular build but also from the
confidence of knowing he looks good in his tank top and baggy
shorts.
 &HT;    As his spotter, Aaron Anavim, looked on, Alexander lifted the
85-pound weights three more times, arms quivering, face reddening
with effort. Each dumbbell, I realized as I watched, weighed more
than I did when I entered high school. Another half-dozen
teen-agers milled around the weight room, casting glances at
themselves and one another in the mirror.
 &HT;    They talked of looking ``cut,'' with sharp definition to their
muscles, and of developing ``six-packs,'' crisp divisions of the
abdominals, but of all the muscles that get a workout in rooms like
these, the most important may be the ones that move the eyes in
restless sweeping arcs of comparison and appraisal.
 &HT;    ``Once you're in this game to manipulate your body,'' Alexander
said, ``you want to be the best.'' While we talked between sets of
Alexander's 90-minute routine, his eyes wandered to the mirror
again and again, searching for flaws, looking for areas of
improvement. ``The more you lift,'' he admitted, ``the more you
look in the mirror.''
 &HT;    In this weight room, in a gym in a northern New Jersey suburb,
the gym rats have a nickname for Alexander: Mirror Boy. That's a
vast improvement over the nicknames he endured at school not long
ago.
 &HT;    ``I know it sounds kind of odd to have favorite insults,'' he
told me with a wry smile, munching on a protein bar before moving
on to his next set of lifts, ``but Chunk Style always was kind of
funny.''
 &HT;    And kind of appropriate. Until recently, Alexander carried
nearly 210 pounds on a 5-foot-6 frame, and when I asked if he was
teased about his weight, he practically dropped a dumbbell on my
feet.
 &HT;    ``Oh! Oh, man, was I teased? Are you kidding?'' he said in his
rapid, agreeable patter. ``When I was fat, people must have gone
home and thought of nothing else except coming in with new material
the next day. They must have had study groups just to make fun of
people who were overweight.''
 &HT;    He even got an earful at home. ``My parents _ God bless them,
but they would make comments all the time. My father would say, 'If
you eat all that, you'll be as big as a house.' And I'm, like:
'Dad, it's a little late for that. What am I now? A mobile home?'''
 &HT;    The day of reckoning came in April 1998, during a spring-break
vacation in Boca Raton, Fla. As his family was about to leave its
hotel room to go to the beach, Alexander, then 15, stood in front
of a mirror and just stared at the spectacle of his shirtless
torso.
 &HT;    ``I remember the exact, like, moment in my mind,'' he said.
``Everything about that room is burned into my head, every little
thing. I can tell you where every lamp was, where my father was
standing, my mother was sitting. We were about to go out, and I'm
looking in this mirror _ me, with my gut hanging over my bathing
suit _ and it was, like: Who would want to look at this? It's part
of me, and I'm disgusted! That moment, I realized that nobody was
giving me a chance to find out who I was because of the way I
looked.''
 &HT;    And so Alexander decided to do something about it, something
drastic.
 -0- 
 &HT;    There is a kind of timelessness to a teen-ager's battle with
body image, but in most accounts the teen-ager is female and the
issue is anorexia or bulimia. Yet as any psychologist knows, and as
any sufficiently evolved adult male could tell you, boys have
body-image problems too.
 &HT;    Traditionally, boys have felt pressure to look not thin, but
rather strong and virile, which increasingly seems to mean looking
bulked up and muscular. Hearing Alexander give voice to his
insecurities and imagined physical flaws, reminded me all over
again of my own tortured passage through adolescence, my own
dissatisfaction with a body that seemed punitively untouched by any
growth spurt and my own reluctant accommodation with certain
inalienable facts of nature.
 &HT;    Like me, Alexander had been teased and harassed about being
short in stature. Like me, he had struggled to overcome his
physical shortcomings as a member of the high-school wrestling
team. Unlike me, he also battled a severe weight problem, but at a
similar moment in life, we had both looked in the mirror and hadn't
liked what we'd seen.
 &HT;    Still, a lot has changed since I was 15. Consider the current
batch of cold messages from the culture at large. The new anabolic
Tarzan. Aggressive advertising campaigns showing half-naked men in
which the Obsession could just as easily be about your own very
toned body as about someone else's. And Littleton. (Buried beneath
a ton of prose about gun control was the report that Eric Harris
apparently felt dissatisfied with his height, repeatedly
complaining that he was smaller than his brother.)
 &HT;    You would never know that for the past quarter-century, feminist
thought and conversation has created room for alternatives to
traditional masculinity, in which toughness is equated with
self-worth and physical stature is equated with moral stature.
 &HT;    A number of psychologists with whom I spoke returned to the same
point again and again: The cultural messages about an ideal male
body, if not new, have grown more insistent, more aggressive, more
widespread and more explicit in recent years.
 &HT;    Since roughly 90 percent of teen-agers who are treated for
eating disorders are female, boys still have a way to go. Young
girls have suffered greatly from insecurity about appearance and
body image, and the scientific literature on anorexia and related
body-image disorders depicts a widespread and serious health
problem in adolescent females.
 &HT;    But to hear some psychologists tell it, boys may be catching up
in terms of insecurity and even psychological pathology. An
avalanche of recent books on men and boys underlines the nature of
contemporary boyhood in America. A number of studies in the past
decade _ of men, not boys _ have suggested that ``body-image
disturbances,'' as researchers sometimes call them, may be more
prevalent in men than previously believed and almost always begin
in the teen-age years.
 &HT;    Two years ago, Harrison G. Pope Jr., of Harvard Medical School,
and his colleagues published a modest paper called ''Muscle
Dysmorphia: An Underrecognized Form of Body Dysmorphic Disorder''
in a relatively obscure journal called Psychosomatics. The study
described a group of men and women who had become ``pathologically
preoccupied'' by their body image and were convinced that they
looked small and puny, even though they were bulging with muscles.
 &HT;    The paper got a lot of attention, and it led to an even more
widely publicized study earlier this year from the same lab
reporting how male action-figure toys such as GI Joe and the ''Star
Wars'' characters have bulked up over the years.
 &HT;    Recent figures on cosmetic surgery indirectly confirm the
anecdotal sense that men are going to greater extremes to improve
their appearances. Women still account for about 90 percent of all
procedures, but the number of men undergoing cosmetic surgery rose
about 34 percent between 1996 and 1998, with liposuction being the
most sought service.
 &HT;    ``Basically, men in general are getting the same medicine that
women have had to put up with for years, which was trying to match
an unattainable ideal in terms of body image,'' says Pope, who has
focused his studies on college-age men just past adolescence.
 &HT;    The confusions that arise in young males as they try to
reconcile the traditional masculine values of their fathers, for
example, with a postfeminist culture that celebrates sensitivity
and openness have created a ``national crisis of boyhood,''
according to some psychologists _ as well as a boomlet of academic
interest in boys and a burst of popular literature on the subject.
 &HT;    In addition to ``Raising Cain,'' there is William S. Pollack's
``Real Boys,'' Michael Gurian's ``Wonder of Boys'' and James
Garbarino's ``Lost Boys,'' as well as a spate of books and
magazines about male fitness.
 &HT;    Many of these books were inspired by the groundbreaking research
in the 1970s and '80s by Carol Gilligan, of Harvard's Graduate
School of Education, who charted the psychological and moral
development of adolescent girls. Now Gilligan and Judy Chu, her
research associate, are listening to boys' voices too. And one of
the most eagerly awaited books this fall is ``Stiffed,'' an account
of the ``masculinity crisis,'' by Susan Faludi, author of
``Backlash.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    For boys in the midst of the exotic and uncontrollable
incongruence of puberty, growing up in an internal world flooded
with hormones and an external world flooded with idealized male
images, the pressures may be tighter than ever before.
 &HT;    In seventh and eighth grades, Alexander Bregstein didn't fit in.
``I was picked on in every single class,'' he recalled. ``It was
beyond belief. They would do things like hide your bag, turn your
bag inside out, tie your shoelaces together. Some of the stuff I
just can't repeat, it was so awful.''
 &HT;    They called him Fat Boy -- thought he was lazy, that something
was wrong with him. He knew it wasn't true, but he also realized
that his physical appearance made him a social outcast and a target
_ neither of which is a good thing to be in early adolescence.
 &HT;    It was during his sophomore year, getting ``the daylights
pounded out of him'' in wrestling and gaining even more weight,
that Alexander began what he calls, with justification, his
``drastic transformation.''
 &HT;    He started by losing 30 pounds in one month. For a time, he
consumed only 900 calories a day, and ultimately got down to 152
pounds. He began to lift weights seriously, every day for three
months. He started to read magazines like Flex and Men's Fitness.
He briefly dabbled with muscle-building supplements like creatine.
He got buff, and then beyond buff.
 &HT;    By the time his sophomore year in high school began, Alexander
had packaged his old self in a phenomenally new body, and it has
had the desired effect. ``My quality of social life changed
dramatically when I changed my image,'' he said.
 &HT;    He still maintained friendships with the guys in the computer
lab, still programmed, still played Quake with dozens of others.
But he worked out at the gym at least five times a week. He shifted
his diet to heavy protein. He pushed himself to lift ever-heavier
weights.
 &HT;    When I asked him if he ever felt tempted to try steroids during
his effort to remake his physical image, he denied using them, and
I believe him. But he wasn't coy about the temptation.
 &HT;    ``When someone offers you a shortcut,'' he replied, ``and it's a
shortcut you want so bad, you're willing to ignore what it might be
doing to your insides. I wanted to look better. Who cares if it's
going to clog up my kidneys? Who cares if it'll destroy my liver?
There was so much peer pressure that I didn't care.''
 &HT;    After Alexander finished his workout that hot July day, we
stopped to get something to drink at the gym's cafe. ``I feel
pretty good right now,'' Alexander admitted, ``and I was furious
when I went in there.''
 &HT;    It turned out that the night before, he had a conversation with
a girl that took a decidedly unsatisfying turn at the end.
 &HT;    I'm not so worried about kids like Alexander _ he clearly has
demonstrated both the discipline to remake his appearance and the
psychological distance not to take it, or himself, too seriously.
 &HT;    But there will be many other boys out there who cannot hope to
match the impossibly raised bar of idealized male body image
without resorting to the physically corrosive effects of steroids
or the psychologically corrosive effects of self-doubt. Either way,
the majority of boys will be diminished by chasing after the golden
few.
 &HT;    Moreover, this male preoccupation with appearance seems to
herald a dubious, regressive form of equality _ now boys can become
as psychologically and physically debilitated by body-image
concerns as girls have been for decades. After all, this vast
expenditure of teen-age male energy, both psychic and kinetic, is
based on the premise that members of the opposite sex are attracted
to a retro, rough-hewn, muscular look, and it's a premise that
those who study and write about boys have noticed too.
 &HT;    ``While girls and women say one thing, some of them continue to
do another,'' Pollack says. ``Some of them are still intrigued by
the old male images, and are attracted to them.''
 &HT;    Because he's a perceptive kid, Alexander recognizes how
feckless, how disturbing, how crazy this all is. ``I tell you, it's
definitely distressing,'' he said, ``the fact that as much as girls
get this anorexic thing and they're going through these image
things with dolls and stuff, guys are definitely doing the same.''
 &HT;    True, he admitted, his social life has never been better. ``But
in a way it depresses me,'' he said, before heading off to a party,
``that I had to do this for people to get to know me.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On an insufferably muggy afternoon in July, with the thermometer
pushing 90 degrees and ozone alerts filling the airwaves, Alexander
Bregstein was in a foul mood.
 &HT;    He was furious, in fact, for reasons that would become clear
only later.
 &HT;    Working on just three hours of sleep, and having spent the last
eight hours minding a bunch of preschool kids in his summer job as
a camp counselor, Alexander was itching to kick back and relax.
 &HT;    So there he was, lying on his back in the weight room of his
gym, head down on an incline bench, earphones pitching three-figure
decibels of the rock band Finger Eleven into his ears as he gripped
an 85-pound weight in each hand and then, after a brief pause to
gather himself, muscled them into the air with focused bursts of
energy. Each lift was accompanied by a sharp exhalation, like the
quick, short stroke of a piston.
 &HT;    The first thing you need to know about Alexander is that he is
16 years old, bright, articulate and funny in that self-deprecating
and almost wise teen-age way. However, about a year ago, Alexander
made a conscious decision that those weren't the qualities he
wanted people to recognize in him, at least not at first.
 &HT;    He wanted people to see him first, and what they see these days
are thick neck muscles, shoulders so massive that he can't scratch
his back, a powerful bulge in his arms and a chest that has been
deliberately chiseled for the two-button look _ what Alexander now
calls ``my most endearing feature.''
 &HT;    He walks with a kind of cocky gravity-testing bounce in his step
that derives in part from his muscular build but also from the
confidence of knowing he looks good in his tank top and baggy
shorts.
 &HT;    As his spotter, Aaron Anavim, looked on, Alexander lifted the
85-pound weights three more times, arms quivering, face reddening
with effort. Each dumbbell, I realized as I watched, weighed more
than I did when I entered high school. Another half-dozen
teen-agers milled around the weight room, casting glances at
themselves and one another in the mirror.
 &HT;    They talked of looking ``cut,'' with sharp definition to their
muscles, and of developing ``six-packs,'' crisp divisions of the
abdominals, but of all the muscles that get a workout in rooms like
these, the most important may be the ones that move the eyes in
restless sweeping arcs of comparison and appraisal.
 &HT;    ``Once you're in this game to manipulate your body,'' Alexander
said, ``you want to be the best.'' While we talked between sets of
Alexander's 90-minute routine, his eyes wandered to the mirror
again and again, searching for flaws, looking for areas of
improvement. ``The more you lift,'' he admitted, ``the more you
look in the mirror.''
 &HT;    In this weight room, in a gym in a northern New Jersey suburb,
the gym rats have a nickname for Alexander: Mirror Boy. That's a
vast improvement over the nicknames he endured at school not long
ago.
 &HT;    ``I know it sounds kind of odd to have favorite insults,'' he
told me with a wry smile, munching on a protein bar before moving
on to his next set of lifts, ``but Chunk Style always was kind of
funny.''
 &HT;    And kind of appropriate. Until recently, Alexander carried
nearly 210 pounds on a 5-foot-6 frame, and when I asked if he was
teased about his weight, he practically dropped a dumbbell on my
feet.
 &HT;    ``Oh! Oh, man, was I teased? Are you kidding?'' he said in his
rapid, agreeable patter. ``When I was fat, people must have gone
home and thought of nothing else except coming in with new material
the next day. They must have had study groups just to make fun of
people who were overweight.''
 &HT;    He even got an earful at home. ``My parents _ God bless them,
but they would make comments all the time. My father would say, 'If
you eat all that, you'll be as big as a house.' And I'm, like:
'Dad, it's a little late for that. What am I now? A mobile home?'''
 &HT;    The day of reckoning came in April 1998, during a spring-break
vacation in Boca Raton, Fla. As his family was about to leave its
hotel room to go to the beach, Alexander, then 15, stood in front
of a mirror and just stared at the spectacle of his shirtless
torso.
 &HT;    ``I remember the exact, like, moment in my mind,'' he said.
``Everything about that room is burned into my head, every little
thing. I can tell you where every lamp was, where my father was
standing, my mother was sitting. We were about to go out, and I'm
looking in this mirror _ me, with my gut hanging over my bathing
suit _ and it was, like: Who would want to look at this? It's part
of me, and I'm disgusted! That moment, I realized that nobody was
giving me a chance to find out who I was because of the way I
looked.''
 &HT;    And so Alexander decided to do something about it, something
drastic.
 -0- 
 &HT;    There is a kind of timelessness to a teen-ager's battle with
body image, but in most accounts the teen-ager is female and the
issue is anorexia or bulimia. Yet as any psychologist knows, and as
any sufficiently evolved adult male could tell you, boys have
body-image problems too.
 &HT;    Traditionally, boys have felt pressure to look not thin, but
rather strong and virile, which increasingly seems to mean looking
bulked up and muscular. Hearing Alexander give voice to his
insecurities and imagined physical flaws, reminded me all over
again of my own tortured passage through adolescence, my own
dissatisfaction with a body that seemed punitively untouched by any
growth spurt and my own reluctant accommodation with certain
inalienable facts of nature.
 &HT;    Like me, Alexander had been teased and harassed about being
short in stature. Like me, he had struggled to overcome his
physical shortcomings as a member of the high-school wrestling
team. Unlike me, he also battled a severe weight problem, but at a
similar moment in life, we had both looked in the mirror and hadn't
liked what we'd seen.
 &HT;    Still, a lot has changed since I was 15. Consider the current
batch of cold messages from the culture at large. The new anabolic
Tarzan. Aggressive advertising campaigns showing half-naked men in
which the Obsession could just as easily be about your own very
toned body as about someone else's. And Littleton. (Buried beneath
a ton of prose about gun control was the report that Eric Harris
apparently felt dissatisfied with his height, repeatedly
complaining that he was smaller than his brother.)
 &HT;    You would never know that for the past quarter-century, feminist
thought and conversation has created room for alternatives to
traditional masculinity, in which toughness is equated with
self-worth and physical stature is equated with moral stature.
 &HT;    A number of psychologists with whom I spoke returned to the same
point again and again: The cultural messages about an ideal male
body, if not new, have grown more insistent, more aggressive, more
widespread and more explicit in recent years.
 &HT;    Since roughly 90 percent of teen-agers who are treated for
eating disorders are female, boys still have a way to go. Young
girls have suffered greatly from insecurity about appearance and
body image, and the scientific literature on anorexia and related
body-image disorders depicts a widespread and serious health
problem in adolescent females.
 &HT;    But to hear some psychologists tell it, boys may be catching up
in terms of insecurity and even psychological pathology. An
avalanche of recent books on men and boys underlines the nature of
contemporary boyhood in America. A number of studies in the past
decade _ of men, not boys _ have suggested that ``body-image
disturbances,'' as researchers sometimes call them, may be more
prevalent in men than previously believed and almost always begin
in the teen-age years.
 &HT;    Two years ago, Harrison G. Pope Jr., of Harvard Medical School,
and his colleagues published a modest paper called ''Muscle
Dysmorphia: An Underrecognized Form of Body Dysmorphic Disorder''
in a relatively obscure journal called Psychosomatics. The study
described a group of men and women who had become ``pathologically
preoccupied'' by their body image and were convinced that they
looked small and puny, even though they were bulging with muscles.
 &HT;    The paper got a lot of attention, and it led to an even more
widely publicized study earlier this year from the same lab
reporting how male action-figure toys such as GI Joe and the ''Star
Wars'' characters have bulked up over the years.
 &HT;    Recent figures on cosmetic surgery indirectly confirm the
anecdotal sense that men are going to greater extremes to improve
their appearances. Women still account for about 90 percent of all
procedures, but the number of men undergoing cosmetic surgery rose
about 34 percent between 1996 and 1998, with liposuction being the
most sought service.
 &HT;    ``Basically, men in general are getting the same medicine that
women have had to put up with for years, which was trying to match
an unattainable ideal in terms of body image,'' says Pope, who has
focused his studies on college-age men just past adolescence.
 &HT;    The confusions that arise in young males as they try to
reconcile the traditional masculine values of their fathers, for
example, with a postfeminist culture that celebrates sensitivity
and openness have created a ``national crisis of boyhood,''
according to some psychologists _ as well as a boomlet of academic
interest in boys and a burst of popular literature on the subject.
 &HT;    In addition to ``Raising Cain,'' there is William S. Pollack's
``Real Boys,'' Michael Gurian's ``Wonder of Boys'' and James
Garbarino's ``Lost Boys,'' as well as a spate of books and
magazines about male fitness.
 &HT;    Many of these books were inspired by the groundbreaking research
in the 1970s and '80s by Carol Gilligan, of Harvard's Graduate
School of Education, who charted the psychological and moral
development of adolescent girls. Now Gilligan and Judy Chu, her
research associate, are listening to boys' voices too. And one of
the most eagerly awaited books this fall is ``Stiffed,'' an account
of the ``masculinity crisis,'' by Susan Faludi, author of
``Backlash.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    For boys in the midst of the exotic and uncontrollable
incongruence of puberty, growing up in an internal world flooded
with hormones and an external world flooded with idealized male
images, the pressures may be tighter than ever before.
 &HT;    In seventh and eighth grades, Alexander Bregstein didn't fit in.
``I was picked on in every single class,'' he recalled. ``It was
beyond belief. They would do things like hide your bag, turn your
bag inside out, tie your shoelaces together. Some of the stuff I
just can't repeat, it was so awful.''
 &HT;    They called him Fat Boy -- thought he was lazy, that something
was wrong with him. He knew it wasn't true, but he also realized
that his physical appearance made him a social outcast and a target
_ neither of which is a good thing to be in early adolescence.
 &HT;    It was during his sophomore year, getting ``the daylights
pounded out of him'' in wrestling and gaining even more weight,
that Alexander began what he calls, with justification, his
``drastic transformation.''
 &HT;    He started by losing 30 pounds in one month. For a time, he
consumed only 900 calories a day, and ultimately got down to 152
pounds. He began to lift weights seriously, every day for three
months. He started to read magazines like Flex and Men's Fitness.
He briefly dabbled with muscle-building supplements like creatine.
He got buff, and then beyond buff.
 &HT;    By the time his sophomore year in high school began, Alexander
had packaged his old self in a phenomenally new body, and it has
had the desired effect. ``My quality of social life changed
dramatically when I changed my image,'' he said.
 &HT;    He still maintained friendships with the guys in the computer
lab, still programmed, still played Quake with dozens of others.
But he worked out at the gym at least five times a week. He shifted
his diet to heavy protein. He pushed himself to lift ever-heavier
weights.
 &HT;    When I asked him if he ever felt tempted to try steroids during
his effort to remake his physical image, he denied using them, and
I believe him. But he wasn't coy about the temptation.
 &HT;    ``When someone offers you a shortcut,'' he replied, ``and it's a
shortcut you want so bad, you're willing to ignore what it might be
doing to your insides. I wanted to look better. Who cares if it's
going to clog up my kidneys? Who cares if it'll destroy my liver?
There was so much peer pressure that I didn't care.''
 &HT;    After Alexander finished his workout that hot July day, we
stopped to get something to drink at the gym's cafe. ``I feel
pretty good right now,'' Alexander admitted, ``and I was furious
when I went in there.''
 &HT;    It turned out that the night before, he had a conversation with
a girl that took a decidedly unsatisfying turn at the end.
 &HT;    I'm not so worried about kids like Alexander _ he clearly has
demonstrated both the discipline to remake his appearance and the
psychological distance not to take it, or himself, too seriously.
 &HT;    But there will be many other boys out there who cannot hope to
match the impossibly raised bar of idealized male body image
without resorting to the physically corrosive effects of steroids
or the psychologically corrosive effects of self-doubt. Either way,
the majority of boys will be diminished by chasing after the golden
few.
 &HT;    Moreover, this male preoccupation with appearance seems to
herald a dubious, regressive form of equality _ now boys can become
as psychologically and physically debilitated by body-image
concerns as girls have been for decades. After all, this vast
expenditure of teen-age male energy, both psychic and kinetic, is
based on the premise that members of the opposite sex are attracted
to a retro, rough-hewn, muscular look, and it's a premise that
those who study and write about boys have noticed too.
 &HT;    ``While girls and women say one thing, some of them continue to
do another,'' Pollack says. ``Some of them are still intrigued by
the old male images, and are attracted to them.''
 &HT;    Because he's a perceptive kid, Alexander recognizes how
feckless, how disturbing, how crazy this all is. ``I tell you, it's
definitely distressing,'' he said, ``the fact that as much as girls
get this anorexic thing and they're going through these image
things with dolls and stuff, guys are definitely doing the same.''
 &HT;    True, he admitted, his social life has never been better. ``But
in a way it depresses me,'' he said, before heading off to a party,
``that I had to do this for people to get to know me.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The fight takes place in the bright light of adult view _ on a
weekday afternoon, on a tree-lined residential street, within sight
of the police station and a block from the middle school.
 &HT;    The smaller boy, about 12, waits until there is a safe distance
between himself and the other boy, about 13. Then he shouts a
curse. No response. He follows with a homophobic slur. His opponent
_ a chubby boy nicknamed Sex Machine _ finally turns around.
 &HT;    A freckled friend of Sex Machine's loops around him on his
bicycle, lazily doing doughnuts. He prods Sex Machine chirpily:
``You gonna take that? He's a punk!''
 &HT;    Halfheartedly, Sex Machine blusters back a retort. More friends
appear and cajole him, challenging him to at least pretend that he
has nerve.
 &HT;    ``C'mon, Sex Machine!'' one shouts, then whispers to another,
alarmed: ``Look at him. He keeps backing up!''
 &HT;    Whatever started the fight is irrelevant. The friends clamber up
a nearby wire fence to get a good view, hyper spiders clinging to
the mesh.
 &HT;    Sex Machine is frightened. Despite his oversize T-shirt, you can
see the rise and fall of his heaving chest.
 &HT;    A man's voice chimes in and shouts encouragement to the smaller
boy from the driveway. ``That's his father!'' a boy says. ``Can you
believe it? He's telling him to fight!'' ``That's not right,'' says
a girl.
 &HT;    Borrowing from the man's confidence, the smaller boy rushes
forward and swings. Sex Machine stumbles backward as he tries to
duck.
 &HT;    A woman leans out from the second-floor window of a ranch house
and says, ``Come in, come in,'' without sounding as though she
means it, a weary Juliet.
 &HT;    Sex Machine looks desperate, flailing his arms frantically,
trying to flag down a car. Luckily, one stops. Apparently, it's his
mother. All the tension and fear that his body has been holding
bursts into punctuated sobs. He storms around the car to the
passenger side.
 &HT;    His freckled friend, who had been cheering within inches of the
action, cycles over and dismounts to say goodbye.
 &HT;    With all the fury raging inside him, Sex Machine bellows, ``You
didn't help me!'' then shoves him to the ground.
 &HT;    Antrim, N.H., where the fight took place, is a long way away
from Littleton, Colo., as well as from Conyers, Ga., where a
15-year-old boy shot six classmates at his high school in May.
 &HT;    It is one of nine towns whose regional high school, ConVal, sits
in Peterborough, N.H., the setting that inspired Thornton Wilder's
``Our Town.'' But what it shares with those other places, and with
countless others across the country, is a brutally enforced
teen-age social structure.
 &HT;    Boys at the bottom of the pyramid use different strategies to
cope _ turning inward and outward, sometimes in highly destructive
ways. (There has been a fivefold jump in the homicide and suicide
rates of boys in the last 40 years, a rise some experts attribute
to increasing male depression and anger as well as access to guns,
among other factors.)
 &HT;    Most boys live through it, suffer, survive. But the journey may
be especially deadly now because, as the avalanche of new ``male
identity'' literature demonstrates, the old prescriptions for
behavior no longer hold, and the new ones are ambivalent. Today's
young males may be feminism's children, but no one is comfortable
with openhearted or vulnerable boys.
 &HT;    ConVal is in some ways progressive. There are about 900 students
and an administration that consciously works to minimize the
ultramacho sports culture that dominates many schools. Even so, the
traditional hierarchies operate: The popular kids tend to be
wealthier and the boys among them tend to be jocks. The Gap
Girls-Tommy Girls-Polo Girls compose the pool of desirable
girlfriends, many of whom are athletes as well.
 &HT;    Below the popular kids, in a shifting order of relative
unimportance, are the druggies (stoners, deadheads, burnouts,
hippies or neo-hippies), trendies or Valley Girls, preppies,
skateboarders and skateboarder chicks, nerds and techies, wiggers,
rednecks and Goths, better known as freaks. There are
troublemakers, losers and floaters _ kids who move from group to
group. Real losers are invisible.
 &HT;    Bullying, here as elsewhere, is rampant. Even in small-town,
supposedly safe environments such as Peterborough, a 1994 study
found, the vast majority of kids from middle school up are bullied
by their peers. The shaming is sex-based, but the taunting is more
intense for boys _ an average high-school student, according to
another study, hears 25 antigay slurs a day.
 &HT;    To be an outcast boy is to be a ``nonboy,'' to be feminine, to
be weak. Bullies function as a kind of peer police enforcing the
social code, and ConVal's freaks are accustomed to the daily
onslaught.
 &HT;    The revenge-of-the-nerds refrain _ which assures unpopular boys
that if they only hold on through high school, the roster of
winners will change _ does not question the hierarchy that puts the
outcasts at risk. So boys survive by their stamina, sometimes by
their fists, but mainly, if they're lucky, with the help of the
family they've created among their friends.
 &HT;    Teen-agers find heroes among their friends. Tyler Snitko, 17,
pulls other outcasts in, functioning as a kind of human insulation
for the freaks. To each taunt he quips, ``Thank you.'' He booms,
``These are my people,'' opening his arms, his fingernails polished
black, to embrace his fellow freaks at lunch time in what has been
labeled Mutant Hall.
 &HT;    In the presence of someone like Tyler, the more vulnerable
teen-agers are less likely to be picked on, and they intuitively
know this.
 &HT;    Tyler's hero is his grandfather. Not only did the old man give
him advice that he often quotes (``Sometimes there are going to be
rat bastards in life, and you have to deal with them''), but he
also backed up the talk with action: He gave Tyler his first set of
weights.
 &HT;    Tyler kept his workout strategy secret, taking long, midnight
runs because he did not want to jeopardize his affiliation with the
freaks, who were supposed to be ``all skinny and pale.'' He soon
discovered that his best friend, Toffer, 17, studied jujitsu to
control the anger building in himself.
 &HT;    Toffer knew what it was like to be excluded. His isolation began
in elementary school, and only in high school, through his
friendship with Tyler, did the fog begin to lift. Through the worst
of the ostracization, the boys had each other.
 &HT;    Says Tyler: ``Other people turned me away, like I'd bring the
whole house down. He stood by me.''
 &HT;    Toffer, whose name is Christopher Eppig, is a senior who looks
very much like Jesus. He survived the solitary years by not showing
emotion. He shows very little emotion now.
 &HT;    ``I think it was the fact that I couldn't completely control
myself that scared me,'' he says flatly. ``I didn't like myself
because I didn't have anything. No athletics, no grades. The only
thing that kept me going was that I hated them more than I hated
myself.
 &HT;    ``Before, all I knew was what people were telling me about
myself, and it wasn't a positive image, and I wasn't interested in
who I was,'' he continues. ``Jujitsu gave me something else that I
was, that was better and more believable.''
 &HT;    The friendship with Tyler created elbow room. They joined the
wrestling team. They formed a band named Gawd. It helps that
Tyler's parents encourage his use of their renovated colonial as a
social center, and that his dad quit his job as an executive to
stay home full time.
 &HT;    His parents call the arrangement a luxury, a decision they made
around the time when Tyler's mother was promoted to assistant
principal of a middle school. Then Tyler had the great good fortune
of several growing spurts, which, at last measure, topped six feet
to match the hard-earned bulk.
 &HT;    His upbeat personality may defuse hostility, but his physical
presence is a moat. A friend who has known Tyler since childhood,
who will only give his on-line name, Bladerunner, says: ``He is
just really nice and he sticks up for people.''
 &HT;    Even as it helps in the day-to-day of high school, bodily
renovation perpetuates the hierarchy. Bulking up _ or being near
someone who does _ just means the pyramid starts lower down.
 &HT;    Tyler recognizes how the pressure to prove his masculinity drove
him to objectify girls. ``I treated my girlfriends really bad,'' he
says. ``I admit it. I was like, Oh, there's a pair of boobs, I'll
go stand next to it. I think I'll go talk to it.''
 &HT;    Of course, trivializing girls is a most likely result of a
pecking order in which girls represent ``femininity,'' the
perceived threat to conventional masculinity, the mix of which
leaves boys so confused these days. The fear of feminizing boys is
embedded in the hierarchy of the social cliques: winner-loser,
popular-outcast, boy-girl.
 &HT;    ``This fear of sissifying boys,'' says Olga Silverstein, author
of ``The Courage to Raise Good Men,'' ``I think it's going to be
the last prejudice to go.''
 &HT;    J., who doesn't want his name to be used, is another boy who
ranks as a loser. He finds temporary refuge with the burnouts, but
his precarious welcome depends upon their mood and whether or not
he has weed. His greatest flaw seems to be his willingness to try
anything to fit in.
 &HT;    The week after the shootings in Littleton, Colo., ConVal High
School held an assembly about school safety. J. recounts what
happened in his class next period. ``I said, 'I wish those kids
would come over here and blow away the teachers''' _ especially an
assistant principal, with whom J. had a long history.
 &HT;    According to J., the classroom teacher said, ``I'm kind of
concerned about you.''
 &HT;    ``Nothing to be concerned about,'' J. replied.
 &HT;    ``Do you want to go to the office?'' she asked.
 &HT;    ``Hell, no,'' he said. Then she sent him there.
 &HT;    Ordinarily, J. would have been sent home for cursing. He knew
the drill. This time, however, he would wait for the Peterborough
police, who, he says, searched his knapsack and escorted him to the
station, where he was charged in juvenile court with disorderly
conduct. (ConVal officials cannot comment on J.'s case because he
is a juvenile and because it is pending.)
 &HT;    That night, the police appeared at the homes of members of J.'s
family with a search warrant and collected handguns and sporting
rifles. The next day, news cameras greeted ConVal students in the
parking lot. The print media continued the story, and J. became
known as a copycat in a wider world.
 &HT;    ``It's retarded,'' he says. ``I shouldn't have got in trouble.
If it was some good kid that did it, they wouldn't have gotten in
trouble.''
 &HT;    Many students feel that the administration overreacted, less
because of Columbine than for the fact that even if he had meant
what he said, he was an unlikely candidate to carry out that
particular kind of plan. Says one parent, sighing, summing up a
typical adult response, ``That's just J. being J. again.''
 &HT;    Being J., according to J., is as inevitable as his difficulty in
school, which he compares to his unhappiness in his family life. He
says: ``I try not to spend much time at home. It's like I'm a
failure. My sister is a straight-A student and everything.'' He
doesn't get along with his stepfather.
 &HT;    Right now, his relationship with his mother isn't good.
``Whenever I get in trouble, she yells at me for 10 minutes, then
she stops,'' J. says. ``They yell nonstop, then they forget what
they are yelling for. They don't even punish me. It's like a habit
with them.''
 &HT;    J. spends his days watching television. In the afternoons, he
goes to the nearby basketball court. His mother tracks him down.
(She declined to comment for this story.) J. says, ``Then she yells
at me all the way home, then I fall asleep and get up and do it all
over again.''
 &HT;    Since Columbine, the Safe School Committee at ConVal has
undergone a renaissance. The Peterborough police have stationed an
officer at the entrance. But many of the students believe that a
shooting spree like that of Klebold and Harris's could happen
anywhere.
 &HT;    Says Toffer: ``It certainly didn't happen because of the lack of
a safe-school committee. Their problem was, they weren't accepted,
and they weren't going to be accepted, and that's the way that our
society is. There are always people that are going to be cast out
and people that are cast in.''
 &HT;    Colleen, a slim girl with short straight hair and an easy smile,
grew up down the street from J. He's generally annoying, she says.
He used to sing Christmas carols on the bus in June, but he is not

described to her, in the high school's on-site preschool, how
content he felt playing among the little kids.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The fight takes place in the bright light of adult view _ on a
weekday afternoon, on a tree-lined residential street, within sight
of the police station and a block from the middle school.
 &HT;    The smaller boy, about 12, waits until there is a safe distance
between himself and the other boy, about 13. Then he shouts a
curse. No response. He follows with a homophobic slur. His opponent
_ a chubby boy nicknamed Sex Machine _ finally turns around.
 &HT;    A freckled friend of Sex Machine's loops around him on his
bicycle, lazily doing doughnuts. He prods Sex Machine chirpily:
``You gonna take that? He's a punk!''
 &HT;    Halfheartedly, Sex Machine blusters back a retort. More friends
appear and cajole him, challenging him to at least pretend that he
has nerve.
 &HT;    ``C'mon, Sex Machine!'' one shouts, then whispers to another,
alarmed: ``Look at him. He keeps backing up!''
 &HT;    Whatever started the fight is irrelevant. The friends clamber up
a nearby wire fence to get a good view, hyper spiders clinging to
the mesh.
 &HT;    Sex Machine is frightened. Despite his oversize T-shirt, you can
see the rise and fall of his heaving chest.
 &HT;    A man's voice chimes in and shouts encouragement to the smaller
boy from the driveway. ``That's his father!'' a boy says. ``Can you
believe it? He's telling him to fight!'' ``That's not right,'' says
a girl.
 &HT;    Borrowing from the man's confidence, the smaller boy rushes
forward and swings. Sex Machine stumbles backward as he tries to
duck.
 &HT;    A woman leans out from the second-floor window of a ranch house
and says, ``Come in, come in,'' without sounding as though she
means it, a weary Juliet.
 &HT;    Sex Machine looks desperate, flailing his arms frantically,
trying to flag down a car. Luckily, one stops. Apparently, it's his
mother. All the tension and fear that his body has been holding
bursts into punctuated sobs. He storms around the car to the
passenger side.
 &HT;    His freckled friend, who had been cheering within inches of the
action, cycles over and dismounts to say goodbye.
 &HT;    With all the fury raging inside him, Sex Machine bellows, ``You
didn't help me!'' then shoves him to the ground.
 &HT;    Antrim, N.H., where the fight took place, is a long way away
from Littleton, Colo., as well as from Conyers, Ga., where a
15-year-old boy shot six classmates at his high school in May.
 &HT;    It is one of nine towns whose regional high school, ConVal, sits
in Peterborough, N.H., the setting that inspired Thornton Wilder's
``Our Town.'' But what it shares with those other places, and with
countless others across the country, is a brutally enforced
teen-age social structure.
 &HT;    Boys at the bottom of the pyramid use different strategies to
cope _ turning inward and outward, sometimes in highly destructive
ways. (There has been a fivefold jump in the homicide and suicide
rates of boys in the last 40 years, a rise some experts attribute
to increasing male depression and anger as well as access to guns,
among other factors.)
 &HT;    Most boys live through it, suffer, survive. But the journey may
be especially deadly now because, as the avalanche of new ``male
identity'' literature demonstrates, the old prescriptions for
behavior no longer hold, and the new ones are ambivalent. Today's
young males may be feminism's children, but no one is comfortable
with openhearted or vulnerable boys.
 &HT;    ConVal is in some ways progressive. There are about 900 students
and an administration that consciously works to minimize the
ultramacho sports culture that dominates many schools. Even so, the
traditional hierarchies operate: The popular kids tend to be
wealthier and the boys among them tend to be jocks. The Gap
Girls-Tommy Girls-Polo Girls compose the pool of desirable
girlfriends, many of whom are athletes as well.
 &HT;    Below the popular kids, in a shifting order of relative
unimportance, are the druggies (stoners, deadheads, burnouts,
hippies or neo-hippies), trendies or Valley Girls, preppies,
skateboarders and skateboarder chicks, nerds and techies, wiggers,
rednecks and Goths, better known as freaks. There are
troublemakers, losers and floaters _ kids who move from group to
group. Real losers are invisible.
 &HT;    Bullying, here as elsewhere, is rampant. Even in small-town,
supposedly safe environments such as Peterborough, a 1994 study
found, the vast majority of kids from middle school up are bullied
by their peers. The shaming is sex-based, but the taunting is more
intense for boys _ an average high-school student, according to
another study, hears 25 antigay slurs a day.
 &HT;    To be an outcast boy is to be a ``nonboy,'' to be feminine, to
be weak. Bullies function as a kind of peer police enforcing the
social code, and ConVal's freaks are accustomed to the daily
onslaught.
 &HT;    The revenge-of-the-nerds refrain _ which assures unpopular boys
that if they only hold on through high school, the roster of
winners will change _ does not question the hierarchy that puts the
outcasts at risk. So boys survive by their stamina, sometimes by
their fut mainly, if they're lucky, with the help of the
family they've created among their friends.
 &HT;    Teen-agers find heroes among their friends. Tyler Snitko, 17,
pulls other outcasts in, functioning as a kind of human insulation
for the freaks. To each taunt he quips, ``Thank you.'' He booms,
``These are my people,'' opening his arms, his fingernails polished
black, to embrace his fellow freaks at lunch time in what has been
labeled Mutant Hall.
 &HT;    In the presence of someone like Tyler, the more vulnerable
teen-agers are less likely to be picked on, and they intuitively
know this.
 &HT;    Tyler's hero is his grandfather. Not only did the old man give
him advice that he often quotes (``Sometimes there are going to be
rat bastards in life, and you have to deal with them''), but he
also backed up the talk with action: He gave Tyler his first set of
weights.
 &HT;    Tyler kept his workout strategy secret, taking long, midnight
runs because he did not want to jeopardize his affiliation with the
freaks, who were supposed to be ``all skinny and pale.'' He soon
discovered that his best friend, Toffer, 17, studied jujitsu to
control the anger building in himself.
 &HT;    Toffer knew what it was like to be excluded. His isolation began
in elementary school, and only in high school, through his
friendship with Tyler, did the fog begin to lift. Through the worst
of the ostracization, the boys had each other.
 &HT;    Says Tyler: ``Other people turned me away, like I'd bring the
whole house down. He stood by me.''
 &HT;    Toffer, whose name is Christopher Eppig, is a senior who looks
very much like Jesus. He survived the solitary years by not showing
emotion. He shows very little emotion now.
 &HT;    ``I think it was the fact that I couldn't completely control
myself that scared me,'' he says flatly. ``I didn't like myself
because I didn't have anything. No athletics, no grades. The only
thing that kept me going was that I hated them more than I hated
myself.
 &HT;    ``Before, all I knew was what people were telling me about
myself, and it wasn't a positive image, and I wasn't interested in
who I was,'' he continues. ``Jujitsu gave me something else that I
was, that was better and more believable.''
 &HT;    The friendship with Tyler created elbow room. They joined the
wrestling team. They formed a band named Gawd. It helps that
Tyler's parents encourage his use of their renovated colonial as a
social center, and that his dad quit his job as an executive to
stay home full time.
 &HT;    His parents call the arrangement a luxury, a decision they made
around the time when Tyler's mother was promoted to assistant
principal of a middle school. Then Tyler had the great good fortune
of several growing spurts, which, at last measure, topped six feet
to match the hard-earned bulk.
 &HT;    His upbeat personality may defuse hostility, but his physical
presence is a moat. A friend who has known Tyler since childhood,
who will only give his on-line name, Bladerunner, says: ``He is
just really nice and he sticks up for people.''
 &HT;    Even as it helps in the day-to-day of high school, bodily
renovation perpetuates the hierarchy. Bulking up _ or being near
someone who does _ just means the pyramid starts lower down.
 &HT;    Tyler recognizes how the pressure to prove his masculinity drove
him to objectify girls. ``I treated my girlfriends really bad,'' he
says. ``I admit it. I was like, Oh, there's a pair of boobs, I'll
go stand next to it. I think I'll go talk to it.''
 &HT;    Of course, trivializing girls is a most likely result of a
pecking order in which girls represent ``femininity,'' the
perceived threat to conventional masculinity, the mix of which
leaves boys so confused these days. The fear of feminizing boys is
embedded in the hierarchy of the social cliques: winner-loser,
popular-outcast, boy-girl.
 &HT;    ``This fear of sissifying boys,'' says Olga Silverstein, author
of ``The Courage to Raise Good Men,'' ``I think it's going to be
the last prejudice to go.''
 &HT;    J., who doesn't want his name to be used, is another boy who
ranks as a loser. He finds temporary refuge with the burnouts, but
his precarious welcome depends upon their mood and whether or not
he has weed. His greatest flaw seems to be his willingness to try
anything to fit in.
 &HT;    The week after the shootings in Littleton, Colo., ConVal High
School held an assembly about school safety. J. recounts what
happened in his class next period. ``I said, 'I wish those kids
would come over here and blow away the teachers''' _ especially an
assistant principal, with whom J. had a long history.
 &HT;    According to J., the classroom teacher said, ``I'm kind of
concerned about you.''
 &HT;    ``Nothing to be concerned about,'' J. replied.
 &HT;    ``Do you want to go to the office?'' she asked.
 &HT;    ``Hell, no,'' he said. Then she sent him there.
 &HT;    Ordinarily, J. would have been sent home for cursing. He knew
the drill. This time, however, he would wait for the Peterborough
police, who, he says, searched his knapsack and escorted him to the
station, where he was charged in juvenile court with disorderly
conduct. (ConVal officials cannot comment on J.'s case because he
is a juvenile and because it is pending.)
 &HT;    That night, the police appeared at the homes of members of J.'s
family with a search warrant and collected handguns and sporting
rifles. The next day, news cameras greeted ConVal students in the
parking lot. The print media continued the story, and J. became
known as a copycat in a wider world.
 &HT;    ``It's retarded,'' he says. ``I shouldn't have got in trouble.
If it was some good kid that did it, they wouldn't have gotten in
trouble.''
 &HT;    Many students feel that the administration overreacted, less
because of Columbine than for the fact that even if he had meant
what he said, he was an unlikely candidate to carry out that
particular kind of plan. Says one parent, sighing, summing up a
typical adult response, ``That's just J. being J. again.''
 &HT;    Being J., according to J., is as inevitable as his difficulty in
school, which he compares to his unhappiness in his family life. He
says: ``I try not to spend much time at home. It's like I'm a
failure. My sister is a straight-A student and everything.'' He
doesn't get along with his stepfather.
 &HT;    Right now, his relationship with his mother isn't good.
``Whenever I get in trouble, she yells at me for 10 minutes, then
she stops,'' J. says. ``They yell nonstop, then they forget what
they are yelling for. They don't even punish me. It's like a habit
with them.''
 &HT;    J. spends his days watching television. In the afternoons, he
goes to the nearby basketball court. His mother tracks him down.
(She declined to comment for this story.) J. says, ``Then she yells
at me all the way home, then I fall asleep and get up and do it all
over again.''
 &HT;    Since Columbine, the Safe School Committee at ConVal has
undergone a renaissance. The Peterborough police have stationed an
officer at the entrance. But many of the students believe that a
shooting spree like that of Klebold and Harris's could happen
anywhere.
 &HT;    Says Toffer: ``It certainly didn't happen because of the lack of
a safe-school committee. Their problem was, they weren't accepted,
and they weren't going to be accepted, and that's the way that our
society is. There are always people that are going to be cast out
and people that are cast in.''
 &HT;    Colleen, a slim girl with short straight hair and an easy smile,
grew up down the street from J. He's generally annoying, she says.
He used to sing Christmas carols on the bus in June, but he is not
cruel. Everyone, she says, has their days. What J. hates is people
talking down to him, so she takes care not to do that. She feels
the same way when people talk down to her because she is a girl.
 &HT;    ``There are times I can talk to him about things, without it
being weird and without him being a pervert,'' she says. It's all
relative. When you are close to the bottom, there's not much room
left to fit. She recalls J. at his happiest during a class he
described to her, in the high school's on-site preschool, how
content he felt playing among the little kids.

ONCE-DISTANT WALL STREET NOW COURTS HIGH-TECH BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not long ago, technology financing was a small
market ruled by investment bankers in San Francisco and led by
industry visionaries such as Bill Hambrecht, Sandy Robertson and
Thom Weisel.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street elite scoffed at high-tech bankers. They chided
Robertson, calling him ``Buck Rogers,'' after the comic strip space
adventurer. The few Wall Street bankers who ventured West stayed
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. The anti-technology bias on Wall Street has vanished
faster than you can say www-dot-com. Today, high-tech financing is
the largest and fastest growing sector in investment banking, with
brawny Wall Street bankers dominating mergers and acquisitions as
well as initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment banks have awakened to the opportunities in
technology financing,'' said Paul Chamberlain, managing director at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and co-head of the company's West Coast
technology group. ``We're bringing a lot of wealth and experience
to bear on the sector.''
</P>
<P>
   As technology enjoys its golden age, several New York investment
banks have strutted into Silicon Valley to get in on the lucrative
business.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs opened a large office in Menlo
Park on Sand Hill Road, ``ground zero'' for venture capital. During
the mid-1990s, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and other investment houses also strengthened their
outposts in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or 10 years ago, the major New York banks saw the tech
sector as a niche market,'' said Brad Koenig, co-head of Goldman
Sach's global technology group. ``Today, Wall Street firms are
making technology their highest priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Their sheer size and range of investment services have eclipsed
two of the mightiest technology underwriters in San Francisco:
Montgomery Securities, founded by Weisel; and Robertson Stephens,
started by Robertson. A third San Francisco-based investment house,
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, still funds high-tech startups.
</P>
<P>
   The financial firepower of the larger Wall Street investment
companies has propelled the nation's high-tech economy. Last year,
the deal makers churned out a record $419 billion in technology and
telecommunications mergers, according to Forbes magazine. That
amount far surpassed other business sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The pace didn't slow in the first half of 1999, with technology
deals ruling the financial headlines. Whether in Wall Street
corporate offices or over breakfast at Buck's in Woodside, bankers
and their clients signed off on a record 617 Internet-related
mergers worth $43 billion, according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data. That figure does not include any
telecommunications deals.
</P>
<P>
   According to Koenig, the high-tech sector has 1,200 publicly
traded companies with a combined market value of $500 billion. Any
Wall Street investment company would be foolish to ignore that
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth is staggering,'' Koenig said. ``If you want to be a
leading global investment bank, you've got to be a leader in the
tech market.''
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &UR;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the technology market brings in 5 percent to 25
percent of a Wall Street bank's revenues, according to Chamberlain.
Not surprisingly, competition is fierce among the top investment
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our name carries its own weight and cachet,'' said Scott
Ryles, a 20-year Wall Street veteran and the head of Merrill
Lynch's technology group in Palo Alto. ``We have market scale,
market savvy and market power _ all the services a client may
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars are spent courting clients who may run the
next Netscape or Amazon.com. Last month, for instance, Merrill
Lynch flew in hundreds of clients to the Beaver Creek Hyatt resort
near Vail, Colo., for several days of dining, golfing and fishing.
Other banks sponsor similar gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   In February, when Goldman Sachs moved to the same Menlo Park
office complex as its rival, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the Morgan
Stanley bankers sent over a big fruit basket as a gift. A welcome
note read: ``There goes the neighborhood!''
</P>
<P>
   The new style of Silicon Valley banking is worlds apart from
Wall Street's traditions. Bankers here don casual attire that
mirrors the laid-back entrepreneurs of the Valley. Hot summer days
in August are spent working on mergers and public offerings, not
vacationing in the Hamptons on Long Island or at Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of dealmaking and strategizing has quickened. While
old-style merger talks might drag on for months, high-tech deals
get sealed within weeks, even days. Internet and other technology
products grow, wilt and bloom again so rapidly that business
strategies are constantly being revised.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best-known players are at Morgan Stanley: veteran
technology analyst Charles Phillips and Internet analyst Mary
Meeker.
</P>
<P>
   High-caliber analysts are in such demand that they command
signing bonuses of $500,000 to $1 million and annual cash
compensation of $2 million to $5 million. To keep them from jumping
to rival outfits, brokerages also may offer sweet stock option
packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research analysts are the new elite of the tech sector,'' said
John Wilson, an executive recruiter at Korn/Ferry International in
San Francisco. ``Their reputations bring in business and give a
firm credibility in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech startups hunting for capital crave the prestige and
investment clout of Wall Street investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it's still old-fashioned banking,'' said
Chamberlain, 35, who earned a master's degree in business
administration from Harvard and who has worked on more than 100
high-tech deals over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Not all is utopia for the Wall Street investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The big players have been criticized for charging high
underwriting fees of up to 7 percent on initial public stock
offerings. The Justice Department is looking into allegations that
several Wall Street bankers have colluded on the fees. In addition,
small retail investors and day stock traders accuse the big
brokerages of favoring large institutional clients, who scoop up 80
percent to 90 percent of the shares of companies going public.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say the Wall Street bankers price these shares far
below market value to ensure that the stock spikes upward on its
first day of trading. That practice makes large investors happy,
since they buy initial shares early at the offering price, then
sell as the stock hits its peak. But, these critics say, startup
companies lose billions of dollars in potential capital through
such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Most startups, though, still want to hook up with the Wall
Street giants. With their arsenal of services, the Wall Street
investment banks can guide a young company through an initial
public offering, talk up its stock or advise executives on future
mergers with competitors.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Overlooking Thimphu, Bhutan's capital and the closest thing it
has to a city, is a 9,000-foot hill called Sangyegang. At the top
of it, where the long, thin, spear-tipped prayer flags never stop
rippling _ and you can serenely take in the full valley, if not the
whole epic impermanent cosmicness of it all _ a red carpet adorned
with loose elaborate patterns of dyed rice has been rolled to the
door of a modest one-story structure.
 &HT;    There, from behind a wood lectern, Queen Ashi Tshering Pem
Wangchuck, the second oldest of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck's four
wives _ all sisters _ steps up to address an audience of A-list
monks, ministers and dignitaries.
 &HT;    This afternoon's ceremony in June falls in the middle of a
weeklong celebration of King Wangchuck's silver jubilee, and the
queen begins by recapping the milestones of her husband's reign.
 &HT;    In the last 25 years, Bhutan has added its first system of paved
roads and telephones, an airport and a two-plane airline and enough
hospitals and clinics to extend the average citizen's life span by
two decades, to 66.
 &HT;    And the day before, in a ceremony presided over by the oldest
queen, the country went on line.
 &HT;    But now this last and most willfully isolationist of the
Buddhist Himalayan kingdoms, which through cunning, diplomacy and
blind geographic luck has somehow avoided getting overrun by
history, is bracing itself for the most pitiless invader ever
loosed upon this world: television.
 &HT;    In two hours, a consultant from Hong Kong will throw a switch in
the little studio behind the queen, and Bhutan will begin bouncing
one-kilowatt broadcast signals off its age-old hills.
 &HT;    The Bhutanese have long brought up the rear in the global race
toward modernity. Serfdom didn't become illegal here until 1958 _
and 10 miles outside Thimphu you're still practically in the Middle
Ages.
 &HT;    On the two-hour drive from the airport at Paro, you pass through
scenes of astonishing scale and emptiness. A couple sit on a mound
staring wordlessly at the mute hills. A woman of indeterminate age,
stooped under an unidentifiable burden, walks through a landscape
so desolate there is no inkling of where she might have taken up
her load or hopes to put it down.
 &HT;    The novice traveler might conclude from such scenes that a
little television could hardly do these folks much harm. At least
they could sit and stare at something that moves faster than plate
tectonics.
 &HT;    But despite its poverty _ the average annual income is $550 _
Bhutan has never viewed the preservation of its culture as an
indulgence, and has expended considerable resources in its defense.
 &HT;    In the late '70s, the king coined the phrase ``Gross National
Happiness'' to emphasize that unlike other developing nations,
Bhutan would not be bullied into measuring its progress purely in
material terms. He established commissions to maintain the
country's 2,000 active monasteries, introduced ``driglam namsha,''
the ancient code of conduct, into the school curriculum and
eschewed the easy money of tourism.
 &HT;    Last year Bhutan, which doesn't maintain an embassy in America,
admitted only 6,000 visitors, while Nepal, its neighbor to the
west, took in 500,000.
 &HT;    As today's tradition-steeped ceremony suggests, Bhutan is
determined to access the latest technologies without losing its
distinct national self, to cut some kind of unique deal between the
old and the new and travel what an official planning document calls
``the Middle Path.''
 &HT;    In fact, the country's tortured decision to set up its own TV
network _ called the Bhutan Broadcasting Service, or BBS _ has not
been made as a concession to Western culture but as an attempt to
thwart it. For now at least, the BBS will be broadcast only in
Thimphu, be limited to a few hours a day and will consist entirely
of national news and documentaries about the Bhutanese.
 &HT;    The hope is that television will remind the ancient people of
the Dragon Kingdom who they are, not who they aren't.
 &HT;    Keeping Pandora's box only halfway open won't be easy. Even
before the country's ban on satellite dishes was unofficially
lifted just in time for last year's World Cup, 2,000 were already
despoiling the landscape and the less affluent satisfied their
Hollywood (and Bollywood) requirements through imported videos.
 &HT;    Even if the initial content is a snooze, now that a broadcast
infrastructure is in place, it seems as if it's only a matter of
time before another ancient culture fades to black.
 &HT;    And now, set up on a small wood table beside the red carpet is a
21-inch Malaysian-made Sony. With a pair of rabbit ears
spread-eagled atop it like a crown, it seems far more regal than
the queen. She concludes her remarks, unties the white ribbon at
the threshold of the studio, then turns toward the television. It's
like watching a bloodless coup.
 &HT;    Acknowledging the transfer of power, the screen blooms forth
with that universal symbol of hope and desire: the color bars.
 &HT;    I'm not the only Western reporter privileged to observe this
curious moment in our planet's cultural history. About 30 of us are
standing behind a waist-high rope just to the left of the queen.
Among those chasing the same droll scoop are a magazine writer from
Hamburg, a Reuters reporter from London, TV crews from Paris and
Copenhagen and a phalanx of journalists from India, which borders
Bhutan to the south.
 &HT;    One Indian radio reporter bends down in front of the set and
holds her microphone up to its speaker to record for posterity the
exact instant of Bhutan's capitulation.
 &HT;    Clearly, television moving into virgin territory holds a dark
fascination to the already vanquished. Perhaps it's a chance to
observe in a kind of controlled experiment just how pernicious the
medium really is.
 &HT;    But it's hard to believe we can bring much objectivity to this
morbid rubbernecking. It's like ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers''
being chronicled by people who are already one of ``them.''
 &HT;    Recent data from other previously unexposed pockets of the world
are contradictory. An analysis of the effect of television on young
children on St. Helena, a small South Atlantic island 1,000 miles
off the coast of Angola that began broadcasting television in 1995,
indicates that the behavior of its children actually improved after
two years of watching the tube. The researchers pointed to an
explanation by noting that on St. Helena, TV watching is a
collective family activity.
 &HT;    This news is offset by darker findings on Fiji. Researchers
claim that since the arrival of Heather Locklear on that South
Pacific island _ where ``You've gained weight'' is a traditional
compliment _ formerly content Gauguin-esque teen-age girls are
suffering from alarming rates of bulimia and low self-esteem.
 &HT;    Television's impact in Bhutan is sure to be equally scrutinized,
for it is one of the very last countries on the planet to get
plugged in. Aside from anarchic Somalia and a few laggards such as
Malawi and the Comoro islands, broadcast television has pretty much
conquered the globe.
 &HT;    That said, there is something embarrassing about the size and
single-mindedness of the press in Bhutan this week. To high-ranking
officials, the start of television is no more than a footnote in
Bhutan's decades-long success story, and so at first they are
surprised and delighted that the world seems to have so much
interest in the celebration of ``His Majesty's 25 Years of
Enthronement.''
 &HT;    Upon arrival, each visiting journalist receives a stack of
beautifully inscribed invitations to some half-dozen ceremonies and
parties staged with great flair at temples and other historic
sites.
 &HT;    But almost invariably, the press blows them off if they aren't
directly connected to the tube. We have come to write about
ourselves, not them. As soon as the ceremony ends, each journalist
and his assigned press liaison officer race to their waiting cars
and drivers to hustle back down into Thimphu in time to catch the
first TV broadcast at the home of a ``real'' Bhutanese family.
 &HT;    All of us are looking for a scene with just that right degree of
incongruity to frame this clash of ancient and modern cultures.
 &HT;    In a part of Thimphu called the Lower Market, I am staying in a
traditional three-story house with the first floor a kind of barn
and the top floor an open-air shed for drying yak. The second,
reached by steep outdoor stairs with railings as worn as an old
subway turnstile, is reserved for eating, sleeping _ and now TV.
 &HT;    By the time I barge in, three generations of the Tshering
family, as well as assorted neighbors and cousins, are seated on
the polished wood floor looking expectantly at the Sony in the
corner, from which a 30-foot blue wire has been rigged to run from
the set, across the room, through another room and out a window to
an antenna bolted to the roof.
 &HT;    The broadcast starts about 15 minutes late, just as the audience
is starting to get restless. At first the picture is terrible, but
after a neighbor adjusts the dials, it comes in as clean as
Manhattan cable.
 &HT;    The broadcast features King Wangchuck's speech that morning to
about 15,000 Bhutanese packed into the stone bleachers overlooking
the Changlingmithang sports stadium. He speaks briefly and modestly
about the progress the country has made, and then walks out onto
the stadium's grassy field, with essentially no security, to greet
his guests.
 &HT;    After visiting the bleachers to say hello to his people, the
tall, elegant 43-year-old king - wearing a yellow kiltlike ``gho''
and ceremonial boots _ goes to the center of the field to lead a
performance of the ``tshilebey,'' which traditionally ends major
Bhutanese celebrations. This chain dance, in which everyone in line
performs a couple of very simple slow steps, is somewhere between a
hora and the sun dance at Club Med.
 &HT;    With its supple editing and lighting, the TV production is
surprisingly professional, and most of the people in the Tsherings'
house sit rapt throughout. The 67-year-old family patriarch, whose
large shaved head has the ferocious mien of a marauding hun, and
his 74-year-old wife, who has the severely stooped shoulders of a
longtime farmer, have never seen a TV show before and don't seem
quite sure if they should respond to it as official ceremony or
routine entertainment. So they take it in with respectful silence.
 &HT;    On the other hand, their daughter, Chenko, spends most of the
broadcast chatting, barely paying attention. She has friends with
satellite dishes _ and today's program strikes her as pretty slow
going.
 &HT;    The show signs off with a soothing Buddhist prayer. Just before
this final fade-out, however, I notice how much air time has been
snagged by a huge balloon hanging over the field bearing
congratulations for the king from Penden Cement. It is the first
brilliant media buy of Bhutan's TV age.
 &HT;    Most likely, the BBS won't be filling Bhutan's airwaves with
jiggly music videos any time soon, but the network is open to
home-grown programming. The person most likely to create Bhutan's
first regular TV show is one of the country's very few
up-from-the-streets entrepreneurs: Ugyen Dorji.
 &HT;    His story, with its Horatio Alger trajectory, feels more
American than Bhutanese. He started out in Thimphu selling
vegetables, then bicycles, then toys, then clothes. At his garment
shop he played music and then began to sell it, and it became the
only place in town where people could buy cassettes.
 &HT;    In the early '90s, he sold the shop, and in '95 built a
recording studio from which he has already produced half a dozen
CDs, including the local pop hit ``Hey, Girl.''
 &HT;    Soon after this, Ugyen dispatched an employee to India for a
three-month crash course in video filming. When he returned, Ugyen
produced Bhutan's first hit feature, ``Not Afraid to Die,'' a
tear-jerker about a woman who falls in love with a handsome guy
with a defective heart.
 &HT;    He recouped the film's expenses _ and then some _ by showing it
for two weeks at the Lugar theater in town and then buying some
generators and taking it on the road.
 &HT;    Ugyen has three more films in the pipeline, including one based
on the real story of some picnicking schoolchildren who died after
getting lost in the mountains. He hopes to show it on BBS. He has
also talked to BBS officials about developing a TV series about a
Thimphu detective.
 &HT;    If you start with a Bhutanese version of the nightly news and
PBS, then jump almost instantly to a sort of ``Columbo'' and
Tragedy Movie of the Week, can a home-grown ``Regis and Kathie
Lee'' be far behind? To an outsider, it's obvious where all this is
heading.
 &HT;    But Bhutan's leaders cling to the notion that they can negotiate
with pop culture. In the ceremony for the initiation of
``Druknet,'' Bhutan's official Web site, the oldest queen, Ashi
Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck, cheerfully announced that Bhutan would
offer 10 days of free (snail) mail service to prevent E-mails from
wiping out the art of letter writing.
 &HT;    Then, evoking an image as vividly art-directed and patently
false as one of IBM's ``Solutions for a Small Planet'' ads, she
said, ``Bhutan's dream for the Internet is that its people will
gain access to the whole world without ever having to leave the
tranquility of their tiny remote rural villages.''
 &HT;    Yet how many Bhutanese will want to stay put in their cozy
villages once they've glimpsed the hubbub beyond? History strongly
suggests that few people will choose to spend eight hours a day
knee deep in mud behind an ox if there's an alternative.
 &HT;    In the end, the only way to slow modernization is to control it
by force. That's what ultimately makes Bhutan's willed
provincialism less than charming. Here, in the name of preserving
tradition, the most basic details of your fate, from who gets
educated and what you do for a living, is decided from on high.
This a country with a national dress code.
 &HT;    The day television arrived in Bhutan, the country's chairman of
the Council of Ministers said the decision to create a broadcast
network was made because it was determined ``that our people had
reached the level of intellectual development that was necessary.''
 &HT;    How much longer will the people of Bhutan _ 43 percent of whom
are 15 or under _ be happy to turn all these matters over to their
wise elders?
 &HT;    Even with the Himalayas at Bhutan's back and a beloved monarch
at the helm, there's no stopping the translucent ooze of Western
culture. Maybe the Bhutanese can last five years. Maybe 10. And by
then, at least, maybe they'll have cable.

 By PETER de JONGE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Overlooking Thimphu, Bhutan's capital and the closest thing it
has to a city, is a 9,000-foot hill called Sangyegang. At the top
of it, where the long, thin, spear-tipped prayer flags never stop
rippling _ and you can serenely take in the full valley, if not the
whole epic impermanent cosmicness of it all _ a red carpet adorned
with loose elaborate patterns of dyed rice has been rolled to the
door of a modest one-story structure.
 &HT;    There, from behind a wood lectern, Queen Ashi Tshering Pem
Wangchuck, the second oldest of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck's four
wives _ all sisters _ steps up to address an audience of A-list
monks, ministers and dignitaries.
 &HT;    This afternoon's ceremony in June falls in the middle of a
weeklong celebration of King Wangchuck's silver jubilee, and the
queen begins by recapping the milestones of her husband's reign.
 &HT;    In the last 25 years, Bhutan has added its first system of paved
roads and telephones, an airport and a two-plane airline and enough
hospitals and clinics to extend the average citizen's life span by
two decades, to 66.
 &HT;    And the day before, in a ceremony presided over by the oldest
queen, the country went on line.
 &HT;    But now this last and most willfully isolationist of the
Buddhist Himalayan kingdoms, which through cunning, diplomacy and
blind geographic luck has somehow avoided getting overrun by
history, is bracing itself for the most pitiless invader ever
loosed upon this world: television.
 &HT;    In two hours, a consultant from Hong Kong will throw a switch in
the little studio behind the queen, and Bhutan will begin bouncing
one-kilowatt broadcast signals off its age-old hills.
 &HT;    The Bhutanese have long brought up the rear in the global race
toward modernity. Serfdom didn't become illegal here until 1958 _
and 10 miles outside Thimphu you're still practically in the Middle
Ages.
 &HT;    On the two-hour drive from the airport at Paro, you pass through
scenes of astonishing scale and emptiness. A couple sit on a mound
staring wordlessly at the mute hills. A woman of indeterminate age,
stooped under an unidentifiable burden, walks through a landscape
so desolate there is no inkling of where she might have taken up
her load or hopes to put it down.
 &HT;    The novice traveler might conclude from such scenes that a
little television could hardly do these folks much harm. At least
they could sit and stare at something that moves faster than plate
tectonics.
 &HT;    But despite its poverty _ the average annual income is $550 _
Bhutan has never viewed the preservation of its culture as an
indulgence, and has expended considerable resources in its defense.
 &HT;    In the late '70s, the king coined the phrase ``Gross National
Happiness'' to emphasize that unlike other developing nations,
Bhutan would not be bullied into measuring its progress purely in
material terms. He established commissions to maintain the
country's 2,000 active monasteries, introduced ``driglam namsha,''
the ancient code of conduct, into the school curriculum and
eschewed the easy money of tourism.
 &HT;    Last year Bhutan, which doesn't maintain an embassy in America,
admitted only 6,000 visitors, while Nepal, its neighbor to the
west, took in 500,000.
 &HT;    As today's tradition-steeped ceremony suggests, Bhutan is
determined to access the latest technologies without losing its
distinct national self, to cut some kind of unique deal between the
old and the new and travel what an official planning document calls
``the Middle Path.''
 &HT;    In fact, the country's tortured decision to set up its own TV
network _ called the Bhutan Broadcasting Service, or BBS _ has not
been made as a concession to Western culture but as an attempt to
thwart it. For now at least, the BBS will be broadcast only in
Thimphu, be limited to a few hours a day and will consist entirely
of national news and documentaries about the Bhutanese.
 &HT;    The hope is that television will remind the ancient people of
the Dragon Kingdom who they are, not who they aren't.

Ecevit had announced his support for large investments to combat

other for sex on the Internet before, this is the first big cluster

is using the Internet to track them down. In addition, some of the

Sun Country Airlines, a small charter airline that started flying

   What a stupid year this has been for American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic was launched this spring when Minnesota elected
former wrestler and professional bigmouth Jesse Ventura to the
governor's chair _ thus rendering Garrison Keillor impotent as a
satirist.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to chuckle about cute little Lake What's-It's-Name
when the real citizens of the region are being captained by a
chrome-domed trash-talker in a fringe jacket?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more ridiculous than the election of Ventura was
the reaction from the media. Sure, a cartoon character winning a
gubernatorial slot in a big cold empty state made for an
interesting feature story _ but the press acted as if Batman had
been elected president of the free world. I mean, how much power
does the governor of Minnesota wield, even in Minnesota?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the tone was set for '99. Nothing was too silly to
be taken seriously. When Ventura's former adversary, the aging and
frighteningly oily-trunked Hulk Hogan, made noises about running
for president, he garnered an inordinate amount of attention _ as
if the guy could actually wrestle the electoral college majority
away from George W. Bush or an Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another wrestling match has been dominating headlines
for weeks _ make that months. Even though the residents of at least
49 states couldn't care less about the Senate race in New York _
which is still more than a year away _ the Time and Newsweek
magazines and ``Hardballs'' of the world have been breathlessly
covering the Rudy Giuliani-Hillary Clinton matchup as if it were
the ultimate in Wrestlemania excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Both potential candidates have been acting like goofs _ Hillary
with her Yankees cap and her coy interviews and her pompous
``listening tour,'' Giuliani with his grandstanding campaign jaunt
to Arkansas and his acerbic remarks about the first lady. Gosh, New
Yorkers will be lucky to have either of these dignified greats
representing them in Washington, won't they?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the press is dying for this fight to happen. The
talking heads keep telling us that if Giuliani and Clinton do
square off, it'll be the most fascinating political race in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that Kennedy squeaker over Nixon in 1960 didn't contain
any drama or change the course of world events or anything.
</P>
<P>
   If the above follies aren't stupidity enough for one year,
consider that Jerry Springer's name was floated as a potential
candidate for the Senate in Ohio _ until Springer's office issued
an official denial last week.
</P>
<P>
   Could I be dreaming, or did I actually hear Springer say: ``Of
course I won't be running. I've spent the better part of this
decade overseeing the worst carnival freak show this country has
ever known, and I'm too ashamed of myself to take a walk in public,
let alone run for office. What's wrong with you people!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe imagining things. Just kidding. What Springer
actually said was that it was ``impractical if not impossible for
me to make a run for the Senate at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't count me out in the future, America.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Springer was issuing his denial, the media was
working itself into a lather over the possibility of Warren Beatty
running for president _ perhaps the stupidest of all the stupid
stories of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I love Warren Beatty's work as a Hollywood hyphenate. When
not seducing just about anyone worth seducing in the 213 and 310
area codes, he has produced an incredibly versatile and compelling
body of work, from ``Shampoo'' to ``Heaven Can Wait'' to ``Reds''
and ``Bulworth.'' But have you seen this man try to communicate
without a script? He's about as articulate as a bag of potato
chips. This guy couldn't win a debate with a mime.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty reportedly won't make a final decision until next month.
If he does decide to throw his charm into the ring, it'll be
interesting to see how he responds to the ``Have you ever used
cocaine?'' question the New York Daily News has thrown at all the
candidates. (George W. Bush refused to answer. Everyone else has
replied in the negative.) One imagines the elliptical Beatty
replying, ``For what purpose?''
</P>
<P>
   Topping off all this nonsense: the always-irrelevant Iowa straw
poll, a non-binding popularity contest in which candidates can
legally wine and dine their supporters and then either embrace the
poll as proof of their momentum or dismiss it as a fund-raising
gimmick, depending on how they finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa straw poll is like a strip club _ whoever spends the
most money gets the most attention from the regulars. But it's also
like a strip club in that you'd have to be a fool to interpret that
affection as genuine.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to believe we've had our fill of stupid political
stories for 1999 _ but we're only two-thirds of the way through the
year, and Matt Drudge, your favorite mainstream-media basher, is
reporting that another famous politician might have been caught on
tape cooing to his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make one long for the days of Ford vs.
Carter, when the biggest question was who was more boring.

PUBLICAN'S CORE SALES RELY ON FERMENTED CIDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEBASTOPOL, Calif. _ Marilyn Renna tilts a pint glass under the
tap, pulls back the tap handle, fills the glass to the brim with an
amber liquid topped off by a slightly foamy head and slides the
pint across the bar to a parched customer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene repeated endlessly in bars and restaurants
everywhere, but this pint at the Ace in the Hole pub is different:
It's brimming not with beer but with fermented, hard cider made on
the premises. Proprietor Jeffrey House touts Ace in the Hole as the
first cider pub in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   House, an entrepreneurial Englishman who moved to the United
States in 1977, says the new pub, which opened July 29, is designed
``to be a showcase for the Ace brand.'' Ace features a line of
smooth, carbonated apple ciders with 5 to 6 percent alcohol that
House has been making since 1994. It is distributed to liquor
stores and supermarkets in the Western states and served in bars
and restaurants in several cities.
</P>
<P>
   House says he envisions Ace in the Hole, the latest venture of
the privately held California Cider Company Inc., as a tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see Japanese tour buses,'' he says of the pub,
located outside of downtown Sebastopol in the heart of Sonoma
County wine country.
</P>
<P>
   A spacious place boasting a pleasant patio with picnic tables,
picture windows, an interior fireplace and handsome bar made of
wood from a vintage water tower, the pub is quiet on a recent
Monday, though House says it is doing well on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A former advertising executive with Ogilvy &AMP; Mather in London,
House has ambitious promotional ideas for the pub. ``We plan to
have concierges from the San Francisco hotels come up for an event.
We will be inviting wholesalers and bartenders and working with
this area's tourist promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem sacrilegious to speak of cider as a tourist
draw in prime wine country, Sonoma County was apple territory for
generations before the grape became so popular. It still produces
fine apples for eating, food processing and commercial
cider-making.
</P>
<P>
   Ace uses Granny Smiths, Gravensteins and ``a melange of others''
to make cider, House said. Most of the apples are grown in Sonoma
County.
</P>
<P>
   Through another company House owns, Thames America, he exports
California wines and imports European craft beers and speciality
ales to the United States. But House has taken a fancy to cider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider is refreshing,'' House says. ``It is less bitter than
beer and has less calories. And it has a lower alcoholic content
than wine.''
</P>
<P>
   House's competitors in the bottled fermented cider business
include Gallo Wine, which markets cider under the Hornsby brand,
Boston Beer's Hard Core, Vermont-based Woodchuck and a Canadian
cider called Whyter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House describes fermented cider as a small but growing niche in
the huge beverages market. In the United Kingdom, he says, cider
holds 10 percent of the market for alcoholic drinks, and is served
in most pubs.
</P>
<P>
   But fermented cider is such a small, new category in this
country, Beverage Industry News publisher Dave Page says his
national trade magazine does not track the drink in detail.
</P>
<P>
   At Celebrator Beer News, a bimonthly national magazine that
mainly covers the microbrew and craft beer industry, publisher Tom
Dalldorf estimates there are maybe two dozen fermented cider
operations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of little cideries popping up everywhere,
wherever wonderful apples are grown: upstate New York, New England.
If it ever gets to be half the size here that it is in England,
it'll be huge. There, if you go into a bar and order a cider, no
one thinks you're weird,'' Dalldorf says.

   EGGPLANT (Undated) _ In the eastern Mediterranean, the eggplant
is a beloved staple. It replaces meat in stews; it is sliced thin,
grilled and drizzled with fruity olive oil; it is charred, peeled
and blended into a silky, garlicky puree; it is layered with
tomatoes, onions and oil and baked until it is creamy and
caramelized. Eggplants are even cooked in sugar syrup and eaten as
a sweet. Such potential has not quite been realized in American
kitchens. And yet we now have more varieties than ever. Chefs use
all of them regularly _ especially this month and next when
eggplant are at the height of their season. By Amanda Hesser.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Editor's note: If you don't have time to read the in-depth story
about Cliffs Notes, a shortened, a la Cliffs Note, version is
provided. 
 
By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, students everywhere have depended on Cliffs Notes _
the popular yellow- and black-striped ``condensed classics'' _ to
get through English class. Started in 1958 by Cliff Hillegass, the
Cliffs Notes publishing house is in Lincoln, Neb. But changes are
brewing. In December, Cliffs Notes was bought by IDG Books
Worldwide, maker of the ``For Dummies'' books, which plans to
expand the Cliffs Notes line into such areas as personal finance
while continuing production of the literary guides. The guides _
280 titles, from classics to contemporary works _ draw mixed
feelings from teachers. Some say students use Cliffs Notes to
cheat. Others fear they prevent students from thinking
independently. Still others say Cliffs Notes are OK as long as
they're used properly. Here's a surprise: Cliffs Notes are written
by English teachers, who view them as a way to earn extra money
while doing what they love _ dissecting good literature.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 80s and retired, Hillegass has never condensed a
classic in his life. But he did invent the official Cliffs Notes
mantra: The Notes are no substitute for the book.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Down the street from the Nebraska State
Penitentiary, across from Midwest Turf and Irrigation, stands a
corrugated-tin building, the kind found in industrial parks across
America. Drab and tan. Utterly utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   That is, except for the vivid black and yellow stripes on the
awning out front, the bumble-bee motif that has evoked Pavlovian
responses of relief in generations of students baffled by
``Beowulf,'' stumped by Steinbeck, flummoxed by Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't guess it, but this building is ground zero for a
phenomenon that has thrown countless teachers into fits of apoplexy
and sent innumerable students running, hearts racing, to the
nearest bookstore, to racks near the back, to the oeuvre of a man
whom they've never met but who promises to deliver them from that
quagmire known as English class. A man said not only to know but
also to willingly divulge the meaning of the white whale, the
secret of the red letter, the reason why the caged bird sings.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Cliff, whose stock shoots up when school bells start
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this the author room,'' says Greg Tubach, acquisitions
editor for Cliffs Notes, who's leading a tour of the birthplace of
that consummate oxymoron, the ``condensed classic.'' The author
room doubles as the smoking room; a faint whiff of tobacco hangs in
the air. All along the walls are stenciled authors' names:
Shakespeare, Wolfe, Chaucer, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to call the kitchen the novel room,'' says Tubach.
</P>
<P>
   Here the stencils list book titles: ``The Grapes of Wrath,''
``As I Lay Dying,'' ``Wuthering Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Cliffs Notes Country, all right. The kitchen is yellow.
The chairs in the smoking room are yellow. The hard hats in the
warehouse are yellow. Oversized yellow wristwatches hang on the
walls. So do posters urging you to ``Get the Cliffs Notes Edge!''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what legions of students do every year, especially
around finals. Competitors exist, sure, but it's Cliffs Notes that
has slipped into the American lingo, Cliffs Notes that has become
as generic as Kleenex or Coke, Cliffs Notes that works as a handy
shorthand for any act undertaken in haste or half-measures (``I was
pressed for time, so I did it the Cliffs Notes way'').
</P>
<P>
   And now, as the 21st century dawns, Cliff stands poised to move
beyond the windy domains of William Shakespeare, John Milton and
James Joyce into the post-college realm of mortgage-hunting and
resume-writing. Cliffs Notes Inc., founded 41 years ago by a
bookstore rep named Cliff (that's him) Hillegass, was purchased in
December for $14 million by California-based IDG Books Worldwide,
maker of those ubiquitous ``For Dummies'' self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   Under IDG, Cliffs Notes will continue to produce the popular
``literary study guides,'' test-prep manuals and reference books,
but that's not all. Soon to come: yellow-and-black primers on
everything from getting out of debt to playing the stock market.
And that's just a start. IDG honchos say Cliffs Notes will venture
deeper into the ``university of life,'' offering quickie treatments
on everything from self-help to pet care to spirituality. (``Yes,
you too can learn Buddhism in your spare time!'')
</P>
<P>
   After that, IDG plans to take Cliffs Notes to foreign lands,
anywhere students puzzle over the ghost in ``Hamlet'' or the role
of the journey in ``Song of Solomon.'' We're talking total Cliffs
Notes world domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, absolutely,'' says bigwig Roland Elgey, confirming IDG's
plans to turn the homey little Lincoln outfit into an international
publishing juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   So as we stand on this precipice _ this cliff, if you will _ the
time seems ripe to visit this slice of Americana. To parse its
themes, explore its roots, before it's sucked forever into the
corporate maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   First, the party line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, Cliffs Notes are a supplement for when a kid is
having a hard time understanding the novel,'' Tubach says.
``They're used in tandem with the novel. A student will read a
chapter in the novel, go to that chapter in the Note, and so on,
back and forth. It's almost a symbiotic relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Tubach and his co-workers at the Lincoln office to admit
to Cliffs Notes' near-sacred status as a convenient cheat sheet _
as a way to slink through sophomore English without ever cracking a
spine _ is close to impossible. Wink all you want. You encounter a
great Cliffs Notes Wall of Denial.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they sort of admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be students who use (Notes) as cheat sheets, but
they're most likely D students,'' says Tubach. ``It might help them
pass the course, but it won't get them a good grade. Students who
use them the right way tend to be the A and B students.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the official Cliffs Notes mantra: The Notes are no
substitute for the book. That's how founder Hillegass (a retired
octogenarian who, incidentally, has never condensed a classic in
his life) intended it. A stern disclaimer at the start of every
Cliffs Notes states as much.
</P>
<P>
   As for all those fuming English teachers who resent Cliffs
Notes, viewing them as roadblocks to true learning, as leeches that
suck the lifeblood from literature _ well, that's a myth, Tubach
says. Every year, Cliffs Notes staffs a booth at the National
Convention for Teachers of English, and the reception is invariably
warm. ``Ironically, teachers are often more willing, more
comfortable teaching a novel if they know there's a Note (on it)
out there,'' Tubach says. ``They, too, view it as a helping hand, a
supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers began to chill out in the '80s, he claims, when Cliffs
Notes changed its emphasis from ``summary'' (what happens) to
``commentary'' (what it means). Cliffs Notes differ some in
structure, but all have common features: a life of the author,
historical context, character analysis, synopsis, commentary and
sample essay questions, sometimes maps, genealogies and glossaries.
All address such English-teacher topics as theme, symbolism and
character.
</P>
<P>
   Tubach, 34, holds an almost-doctorate in English from Texas A&AMP;M
University (all he lacks is his dissertation). He has written two
Notes: ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' and ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame,'' which joined the Cliffs Notes canon of 280 titles ranging
from the hoary (``The Iliad'') to the contemporary (``A Raisin in
the Sun'').
</P>
<P>
   Before IDG bought the company, he worked with a stable of about
15 writers scattered across the country, helping them shorten
literature into ``literary guides.'' That function has moved to
IDG's editing house in Indianapolis. These days, Tubach focuses on
selecting which books will get ``noted'' _ a process that involves
poring over catalogs and asking teachers what they plan to teach,
since only those tomes get noted _ and finding new people to churn
out Notes.
</P>
<P>
   These people turn out to be _ apostasy! _ English teachers. They
view writing Cliffs Notes not as an act of betrayal but as a way to
earn extra money doing what they love: pulling apart the dense,
delicious threads of good literature. People such as Durthy A.
Washington, a part-time English teacher at the University of
Colorado at Colorado Springs who did the Cliffs Notes job on ``Song
of Solomon,'' Toni Morrison's mythic tale about cultural identity.
The booklets serve as ``road maps'' for befuddled readers,
Washington says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soul and texture is in the novel, of course, never in the
Cliffs Notes,'' says Washington, who shrank Morrison's 337-page
opus to a breezy 112 pages. ``The trouble comes when they're used
the wrong way. But there will always be students who look for
shortcuts. I can't control that.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wasowski, a high school English teacher in Mansfield,
Ohio, wrote the Cliffs Notes for David Guterson's ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' which he teaches in an honors English class. Sure, Cliffs
Notes can be abused. But there's worth in them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students use them to get additional ideas or to find
thought-provoking questions,'' Wasowski says. ``Any type of
resource that teaches students more about the author, more about
what's in there, is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he occasionally receives essays bearing the obvious marks
of Cliffs Notes plagiarism, but they're few and easy to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was paid $3,500 for her shrinking act. (Most writers
get $2,500-$4,000 to abridge a work, depending on its complexity
and length, says Tubach.) What she didn't get was input from
Morrison, despite her efforts. Living authors don't take kindly to
being shrunk, it seems. (Note Amy Tan's famous reply upon learning
that ``The Joy Luck Club'' had been Cliff Noted: ``But I'm not dead
yet!'') Washington attended a college-campus lecture at which
Morrison spoke and afterward tried to approach her to schmooze
about her efforts with ``Solomon.'' The literary lioness gave her a
frosty brushoff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed,'' Washington says, still sounding
crestfallen. ``I can understand it, though. If I had put my
lifeblood into a novel and then had someone come along and try to
dissect it, I guess I would be a little hesitant.''
</P>
<P>
   We pause here for the Cliffs Notes history.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry: It's the condensed version.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when Cliff Hillegass, native son of Rising City,
Neb., became head of the wholesale division of the Nebraska Book
Co. He traveled across the country, getting to know
college-bookstore owners everywhere. One day he was chatting with
his buddy and business associate, bookstore owner Jack Cole, who
had introduced a line of condensed classics in Canada called Cole's
Notes. Why don't you try to make it fly in the United States? Cole
asked Hillegass.
</P>
<P>
   Hillegass tapped into his network of bookstore owners and took a
temperature reading: Would something like Cliffs Notes sell in the
United States? Could be, they said. So, in 1958, he got busy. On a
handshake deal with a Lincoln printing company, he put out 2,000
copies of Notes on each of the 16 major plays of Shakespeare, with
1,000 extra copies of the Notes on ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, critics have decried Cliffs Notes as literary
butchery. They note, for example, that Herman Melville's ``Moby
Dick'' is 595 pages; the Cliffs Notes version totals 96. Cliffs
Notes dispatch Chapter 1 in two paragraphs; it takes Melville that
long to introduce his main character, Ishmael.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Pennsylvania's Villanova University went so
far as to ban Cliffs Notes from its bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that in their birthplace, at least, Cliffs Notes
would get a little respect. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't carry them, and if we did, I wouldn't tell a
soul,'' says Paul, a reference librarian at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln who doesn't want to give his last name. This is a
scholarly place, he says; there's no room for Notes. He punches in
the computer coordinates for the Bennett Martin Public Library and
finds that, yes indeed, you can find Cliffs Notes there, 254
titles, everything from Tan's ``The Joy Luck Club'' to the New
Testament. (``Ooh, don't tell me how it ends!'' Paul jokes.)
</P>
<P>
   One sector where Cliffs Notes get plenty of respect is among
students in this Midwestern college town, where Cornhusker football
reigns, the airport boasts four gates and everyone has a sturdy,
corn-fed, vaguely Nordic look. At the college bookstore, employee
Joyce Jensen has seen plenty of panic in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Students) come running in here all desperate,'' Jensen says.
``They get all disappointed when they find we've sold out of a
certain (Cliffs Notes). And they think there's a Cliffs Notes for
every single book ever published. There's not.''
</P>
<P>
   (Tubach assures such students that almost any title can be
downloaded for $6 off the Internet at www.cliffs.com. Regular Notes
cost between $3 and $5.)
</P>
<P>
   The use of the primers seems to have increased in recent times,
says Jensen. ``Sad to say, kids aren't reading as much,'' she says.
``I think maybe they have too many activities, too many things
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, things are quiet in the Lincoln office.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who have worked here 15, 20 years are being ``transitioned
out,'' as Bob Covolik puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Covolik has been around since the beginning. A friend of
Hillegass' sons, he started out in the basement 36 years ago,
stuffing Cliffs Notes into boxes, driving them to the post office.
He has fond memories of working with the old man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd get in there himself and pitch in,'' says Covolik.
(Hillegass was a big art collector; the hallways of the Lincoln
office are lined with furniture-showroom-quality art.) It was all
about customer service, says Covolik, 55, who worked his way up
from part-time errand boy to president. Over the years, the company
expanded from college bookstores to regular bookstores to bookstore
mega-chains to grocery stores. He's always loved his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up to me and smile and say, `I couldn't have
gotten through school without you,''' Covolik says. Everyone who
works for Cliffs Notes has a story like that.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed over time.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with spelling. Cliffs Notes originally had the correct
possessive apostrophe in its name (Cliff's), but people never used
it, so 10 years ago the company took it out.
</P>
<P>
   Sales took a dramatic dive in the '60s, says Covolik, when
``those flower people, do-your-own-thing types,'' tossed
establishment constraints such as plot and theme out the window.
Sales took a strong upswing in the '90s, when the literary canon
exploded and teachers broadened their scope beyond the DWM (or Dead
White Male) perimeters.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change. The top-selling Cliffs Notes have
always been ``The Scarlet Letter,'' except for 1984, when teachers
everywhere taught (you guessed it) George Orwell's 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But now things are really changing. The Cliffs Notes operation
is moving to Indianapolis and California, except for a small
educational division in Lincoln. Covolik will stay on as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for how long,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the warehouse, Charlie Lehl has overseen Cliffs Notes
shipping for 20 years. A big, burly Grizzly Adams of a man with a
pack of smokes in his pocket, he thought he'd work here forever.
Now it's back into the job pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they say,'' he says, grinning sheepishly. ``The
big guys eat the little guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A classic theme.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Today isn't a plain school-clothes day, Lottie decides. It's a
Princess Dress day. Mom doesn't think so, and the two get into a
familiar row involving accusations such as, ``You can't wear that''
and ``We're going to be late.'' So begins Lottie's ``Princess
Dress'' (Dial, $15.99) by Doris Dorrie with illustrations by Julia
Kaergel. The picture book was published originally in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A determined Lottie puts on her gold princess dress, brushes her
teeth and polishes her crown. She's ready.
</P>
<P>
   But something is wrong. Mom looks, well, boring. Lottie
convinces Mom that if today is a Princess Dress day, it is also a
Queen Mom day. ``Today is special,'' Lottie exclaims, ``and you
will look like a beautiful queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom, with reluctance, puts on her red and gold party dress and a
crown.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody they pass on the way to school and to work smiles and
says, ``Today must be a very special day,'' which, when a daughter
and her mom are wearing royal dresses and crowns, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Dorrie's delightful grin-inducing book reminds us that
unconventional daughters and flexible moms can make every day
special. Matching crowns help.
</P>
<P>
   Lottie's story is only one of a wheelbarrow full of delightful
new children's books that can help ease the angst of bidding
another speedy summer goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving wacky but cool fathers equal time is Benedicte
Guiettier's ``The Father Who Had 10 Children`` (Dial, $15.99),
recommended for 3- to 4-year-olds and for all fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Primitive, boldly colored drawings add solidity to the father
who every morning before work makes 10 breakfasts and every evening
after work prepares 10 fried eggs, 10 bowls of spaghetti, 20
meatballs, 50 broccoli spears and 100 raspberries with whipped
cream.
</P>
<P>
   He is one pooped papa. One day he leaves his 10 children with
their grandmother and sets sail for a vacation of maybe 10 days,
maybe 10 months. The second morning he gets out 10 cups and
realizes something is missing.
</P>
<P>
   What does he do? You're right. Gotta love this dad. There's a
bit of the father in all parents, even those who don't have 10
children but who have felt a similar pull between the desire for
serenity and the need to be in the midst of their children.
</P>
<P>
   The book brims over with sweet feelings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Red-Eyed Tree Frog'' (Scholastic, $16.95), with story by Joy
Cowley and photography by Nic Bishop, will turn tiny children into
instant crusaders to save rain-forest homes of these 2-inch-long
Central American frogs.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding photos show a bigger-than-life frog looking for a
meal, escaping danger, taking little naps. With big red eyes that
help him see in the dark, a bright green body and tiny suckered
toes, this buddy stars in his own simple, clear and informative
story. He's cuter than anything Disney could have dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Eric Rohmann's ``The Cinder-Eyed Cats'' (Crown, $17) is
reminiscent of the wonderful ``Dream Child'' by David McPhail. With
few words and magical art, Rohmann takes a small lad in a flying
boat to a faraway land where ``cats like velvet shadows move.'' The
rest of the world sleeps. But not the boy and his world of dancing
fish and gentle tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut your eyes, go to sleep, you have nothing to fear,''
Rohmann tells his young readers. His soft colors and sweetly
creative paintings continue the comfort, wrapping the youngster in
a cozy security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``William Shakespeare &AMP; the Globe'' (HarperCollins, $15.95)
Aliki leads children on a tour of Shakespeare's life and times. No
Gwyneth Paltrow or Joseph Fiennes, but everybody keeps their
clothes on, and Aliki sticks closer to fact that did ``Shakespeare
in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   She tells the story as a play, mixing narrative with pictures
that could pass for peopled sets. The story is a circle, beginning
with the Bard and the theater for which he wrote his plays. Then it
eases into the present-day reconstruction of the theater. The
author lives near the Globe theater in London.
</P>
<P>
   The book is so lively and enticing that children won't mind the
history and literature lessons.
</P>
<P>
   But they'll still mind the fact that summer is over.

RECRUITERS HAVE A MESSAGE FOR OFFICERS LEAVING THE MILITARY:

   SAN ANTONIO _ ``Let's try it again,'' said Jon Petrucelli,
leaning toward the U.S. Air Force officer sitting across from him
on the sofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is the answer to a question _ the old ``tell me about
yourself'' that comes up 40 to 50 percent of the time in job
interviews, and it's a real stumper if you're not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ruben Silva looked a bit ill at ease and stared back at
his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' he said, and took a deep breath, launching into a
halting five-minute monologue, starting with his birthplace in
Brownsville, Texas, and ending with his current job as special
assistant to the jet maintenance academy commandant at Lackland Air
Force Base in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' said Petrucelli, who was leading this mock job
interview in a suite at the Sheraton Hotel. ``You need to lock it
up, trim it up and make it smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrucelli is a recruiter who, like the Marines, is looking for
a few good men and women. But unlike the Marines, his recruits are
already in uniform. He works for Bradley-Morris, a company that
serves as a middleman linking employers with former military
officers and enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Petrucelli's job is to find junior military officers and line
them up with employers who need operations, logistics and
engineering experts. Other recruiters in his company focus on
finding jobs for enlisted personnel, especially electricians,
mechanics, machinists and electronic technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Companies always have hired former military officers and
enlisted men and women. But only in recent years have companies
popped up that recruit exclusively from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling their growth is a tight labor market, a strong desire
among an underpaid officer corps to find a better life for
themselves and their families, and the growing recognition among
corporate leaders that the military produces some excellent
managers.
</P>
<P>
   The former soldiers, sailors and airmen bring to the table
leadership experience and rigorous training that most recently
minted college graduates don't have, said Amy Zimmerman, operations
manager of Orion International in Austin, Texas, another company
specializing in recruiting from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Like many who work for these specialized recruiting companies,
Zimmerman is a former military officer, a graduate of the U.S.
Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One employer that is finding its best managers from among the
ranks of the military is Banta Corp. It recently hired two former
soldiers and is considering a third.
</P>
<P>
   The military is a great source of committed, disciplined workers
who can focus well on goals, said Rob Michel, corporate director of
human resources for the Wisconsin book, magazine and catalog
printer. Banta is launching a Houston office to assemble computer
hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Michel, however, is a little reluctant to talk about his
new-found source for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep it a secret,'' he said. ``It's like
fishing. You don't tell anyone your hot spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite how good he has found his new labor source to be, Michel
has encountered some trepidation at Banta.
</P>
<P>
   Michel said there was some resistance from supervisors because
they expect the former military officers to have a ``management by
yelling'' philosophy. They're also worried the former officers
won't be able to adapt quickly, that they'll be stuck in a rut. But
the company's recent military hires have put those stereotypes
largely to rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The perception that military officers get things done by
ordering others around is a hurdle to hiring, said Shaun Bradley,
president of Atlanta-based Bradley-Morris and a graduate of the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's an outdated image. Today's military focuses on
coaching, mentoring and training _ all management buzzwords of the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use `please and thank you,''' Bradley said. ``Very few
situations require an on-the-spot order except maybe getting shot
at.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co., credited with being the first major
company to foresee the benefits of hiring former military
personnel, began recruiting three years ago _ mostly as an
experiment _ at the behest of Jack Welch, GE's chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment went well, and today GE has more than 1,000
former junior military officers on its payroll, said Jennifer
Whiting, spokeswoman for GE in Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   When news leaked out that Welch, well-respected by other CEOs,
was hiring junior military officers, other companies followed suit,
making the field more competitive. To compete with other employers,
GE tries to get its offer on the table first, Whiting said.
</P>
<P>
   That approach fits with Petrucelli's experience. At a recent job
fair in Chicago, GE made a job offer to one candidate in less than
four days. He doesn't usually see that kind of speed.
</P>
<P>
   It's Petrucelli's job to make sure the recruits look and sound
as good as they can when they interview for jobs. So, he starts
working with them a year or two before they plan to leave the
military, helping them write a resume and learn to answer interview
questions.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, he spent an afternoon in a hotel suite
individually coaching a group of officers who have done well in
their military careers but want something more from the private
sector. Sixty-five percent of the clients had graduated from
military academies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you separating from the military?'' Petrucelli asked
Air Force Capt. Phil White, a young officer wearing a uniform so
starched it looked like it could stand up by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My core values and the military's core values don't match,''
White shot back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petrucelli frowned and shook his head during the mock interview:
``Never give a negative answer.'' Sugarcoat it a bit, he suggested:
``I completed my commitment, re-evaluated my life after five years
and now am seeking more of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Petrucelli speculated that White _ a graduate of the U.S.
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. _ will be much in
demand when he lands on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a super stud. I'll probably put him in front of McKinsey
and Andersen,'' said Petrucelli, referring to the blue chip
management consulting firms McKinsey &AMP; Co. and Arthur Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   All this coaching is designed to make the officers look
irresistible to employers during The Conference. That's the roving
job fair Bradley-Morris sponsors every few weeks that tries to
match soon-to-be former military officers with employers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rigorous two-day experience. On the first day, the
candidates attend briefings to tell them everything they'll need to
know about the employers to get through a half-hour interview. Then
they go through a series of mock interviews, to really polish their
``tell me about yourself'' answers.
</P>
<P>
   The second day is crammed with interviews. Some candidates, who
are advised to dress in navy pinstripe suits with red power ties,
interview with as many as 10 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Silva is a little nervous about going into an interview with
just a briefing to back him up.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, Petrucelli assures him. The first interview is all
about you. ``Dell won't ask,'' he says, ``what do you think about
our computers?''
</P>
<P>
   For the recruits, getting in front of a company such as Round
Rock, Texas-based Dell Computer Corp. is what they hope will be
their ticket out of what is becoming an increasingly difficult
lifestyle that doesn't allow much room for a family.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Keith Hughes said he is scheduled to spend three of the
next five years aboard a Navy ship, but the naval flight officer
doesn't want to be gone for six months at a time because his wife
is pregnant with their first child.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said his last departure affected him deeply when he saw
another officer say goodbye to his 2-week-old infant before
boarding for a six-month journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible to see,'' said Hughes, who is thinking of
resigning next year. ``It's a life for some but not for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Others want to move ahead faster than the military will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stafford, a 1978 graduate of the Citadel in Charleston,
S.C., decided to leave the Army in 1986 after serving seven years,
because of the frustration of not getting ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Your promotions aren't totally tied to merit, he said. If your
performance is good, you'll be promoted along with your peer group,
but not before.
</P>
<P>
   So, Stafford spent a year researching possible employers and
narrowed them down to a list of 10 for their advancement potential,
training assistance and challenge. He ended up taking a sales
representative job with &UR;  &LR; Pfizer, one of his target companies. He is
now regional accounts manager in Houston for the pharmaceuticals
company.
</P>
<P>
   Low pay is another issue that is pushing some officers out the
door. Similar jobs in the private sector pay two to three times as
much as they do in the military, estimated Lt. Col. Cornell T.
McGhee, commander of U.S. Army recruiting in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in pay has widened in the past six years because
the economy is doing so well, he said. To fight the brain drain and
loss of experience, military employees will receive a 4.8 percent
raise in January. Six months later, another raise will boost wages
an average of 5.5 percent, depending on years of service and grade.
</P>
<P>
   Petrucelli understands why people want to leave the military. He
graduated from West Point in 1994 and left active duty two years
later, he said, because he had done what he set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been a platoon leader,'' he said. ``I knew I didn't want
to stay in for 10 years and be a commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers are a hot commodity and recruiters such as Petrucelli,
who are paid strictly on commission, try to lure the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Navy nukes'' _ they're the top guys to place, he said,
referring to the people who work on Navy submarines. ``We get them
very good offers.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the best job candidates, Petrucelli hosts a ``seminar''
every few weeks in a hotel conference room near a military base.
It's a low-key affair _ no fancy hors d'oeuvres, just pitchers of
ice water and small bowls of hard candy. It's part sales talk and
part pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   The offers are coming, Petrucelli tells the eight men sitting
around the conference table, recalling the recent conference in
Chicago that produced the job offer from GE.
</P>
<P>
   They all nod appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Applied Materials will be at the next conference in
Austin, Petrucelli tells them. The officers all nod their heads
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money can I expect to make?'' asks one of the
officers who has come to listen to Petrucelli at the suggestion of
a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   It depends, of course, on location and interviewing skills,
Petrucelli said, but candidates can expect to start at between
$50,000 and $80,000. Again, the officers nod.
</P>
<P>
   A few, however, are still worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we really that desirable?'' one asks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, Petrucelli said soothingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all into goals, and corporate America loves goal-driven
people,'' he said, warming up to his closing. ``Four hundred and
fifty companies come to us for leaders. The best thing you can do
is work with me.''

HUMMINGBIRD BUSH IS A COMMON NAME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I have a hummingbird bush that was given to me, but
a friend has a different bush that she calls a hummingbird bush. I
only have a patio, so will mine grow in a large pot?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not unusual for a common name to be shared by more than
one plant. The clipping from your hummingbird was considerably
damaged in the mail, brown and broken, but appears to be from a
``Hamelia patens,'' a sun-loving shrubby perennial that produces
red-orange tubular blooms. The foliage has a red coloring.
</P>
<P>
   It should be fine in a large pot filled with a well-draining
soil. You will likely need to transplant to a larger pot in the
future. Protect the plant during freezing weather. The top growth
will freeze, but a thick layer of mulch will help ensure that new
growth emerges from the roots in spring.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thanks to such a mild winter, hamelias are giant
10-foot billows. Given freezing weather, they may obtain a height
in the 6-foot range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anisacanthus wrightii,'' a small shrub native to Texas, is
another plant commonly called hummingbird bush. It produces 2-inch
orange blooms summer and fall, has glossy 2-inch leaves and matures
to a height of about 3 feet. It is a good container plant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When is the best time to prune 10-year-old live oak trees
around the bottom of the branches? When is the best time to prune
crape myrtles and wisteria?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not sure I know what you mean by ``around the bottom of
the branches.'' Perhaps you are referring to the idea that leaving
small limbs close to the ground on young live oaks (as with pecans)
encourages the trunks to thicken at a faster rate. The general rule
of thumb is to leave such limbs until the tree has gained some
height, then the lowest branches are removed.
</P>
<P>
   The optimum time to prune a live oak, many experts say, is late
winter to early spring, although I see pruning done at other times
of the year. I always turn to a professional arborist for major
pruning as well as health checks.
</P>
<P>
   Prune crape myrtles while dormant. If I don't get around to
pruning in January, I do so the first half of February. Prune
wisteria after it has bloomed in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been fighting Virginia buttonweed in my lawn. I have
not had much success with broadleaf weedkillers. Consequently, I
have tried other methods of control: pulling the weeds and growing
shade trees.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, one corner of the lawn was severely infested, and
I laboriously pulled every one by the roots. Last year I found no
buttonweeds in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Last year I attempted to pull every weed that was mature enough
to blossom. This year I have pulled seedlings just beginning to
grow. In April, I collected about 100 with at least part of the
root system. Every few days following, I pulled 10 to 50 weeds. In
July, I found that I had missed some that had branched under the
leaves of the grass. I hope that I will have few weeds next year.
</P>
<P>
   I observe that buttonweeds do not grow in shady areas, so for
long-term control I have planted two elms that should give open
shade in areas that now get full sun.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a pre-emergent that can be used in a St. Augustine
lawn?
</P>
<P>
   A: I, too, pull buttonweed. I think it's the most effective
control for this warm-season perennial that begins to show growth
in early spring. Virginia buttonweed spreads by seeds, rhizomes and
rooting stems. You do have to search for the weed among the blades
of the grass to catch it before it flowers, then seeds. The
leathery, dark-green leaves can be difficult to detect in St.
Augustine. If you see the star-shaped white flowers, grab and pull
before these become rows of green seedpods. If you mow the weeds,
they'll simply grow back. Since it is a perennial that can produce
an extensive system of rhizomes, you have to get this underground
network for your hard work to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   I've found that this weed particularly likes moist soil.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your lawn thick and healthy to discourage this pest. This
means proper mowing, fertilization and aeration. I do not know of a
pre-emergent that will do you any good. A post-emergent that
contains dicamba, such as Image, may help. But get ready to apply
more than once in spring and summer. And, as you know, it's most
important to follow instructions as St. Augustine and herbicides
don't always mix.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My bay leaf tree has bugs. Can you identify them? What can I
do for my fig? This year it shed its leaves, and the figs cracked
open before they could ripen.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your bay tree has scale. You can treat with a horticultural
oil. Ask your nurseryman about such products. You can also attempt
control by dabbing on rubbing alcohol, but this can be tedious. If
you're not squeamish, you can actually slide your thumbnail across
the pests. If they flake off easily, they're already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Scales attach themselves to leaves and stems, drinking sap from
the plant. Some ladybugs and parasitic wasps are natural predators.
</P>
<P>
   Figs need a great deal of water during the summer and a thick
layer of mulch. They also need abundant sun, a well-draining,
organically enriched soil, and little or no pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My aunt gave me a plant 45 years ago. Can you identify it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The plant you have appears to be a rockrose, or ``Pavonia
lasiopetal,'' a tough native that may range in height from 2 to 5
feet. It produces its 2-inch pink blooms late spring to frost.
Rockrose is a member of the mallow family, a hibiscus relative, as
you can see from the flowers. The blooms open in the morning and
close in the afternoon. Plants that receive afternoon shade hold
their blossoms open longer. Rockrose is almost evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   This pretty little native likes sun or partial sun and a
well-draining soil. Prune for legginess.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a weed that has begun to overrun my garden. It grows
on top of pine needle mulch, on bare ground and in unused flower
pots. Do you know of a way to get rid of it beyond pulling it out
by the roots? I have tried broadleaf weedkillers to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   A: The weed you sent appears to be one that goes by the
unfortunate common name annual jewgrass, or ``Microstegium
vimineum.'' This is a summer annual that is mostly prostrate and
runs along the top of the ground seeking shade. I pull it from
beneath azaleas and large perennials in an attempt to nab it before
it seeds. Because it's so shallow-rooted, it's not difficult to
pull, and because it grows near desired plants I do not use a
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   This pest is a grassy weed rather than a broadleaf type.
</P>
<P>
   You might check the herbicide labels at a garden center to see
if there is one that targets this grassy weed. Be aware that many
herbicides cannot be used on St. Augustine.

GOODWILL TRAVEL GESTURES STILL EXIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over u in Cancun and a udiaeresis, or two
dots, needed over u in Kitzbuhel) 
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The morning mail was taking on an all-too-familiar tone.
</P>
<P>
   One reader, who had eagerly anticipated a vacation with his wife
and quadriplegic son, related his dismay at the tour packager's
failure to fulfill a promise of providing wheelchair-accessible
facilities at Florida lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   A second letter focused on itinerary ``diversions and delays''
during a youth group's trip to Cancun. Another derided ``price
gouging'' for millennium promotions. Still others reported
frustrations over flight delays, excessive rental-car charges and
hotel discomforts.
</P>
<P>
   I read each missive with empathy and wished anew that I could
push some magic button to right all wrongs. Have travel-service
providers forgotten, I wondered, that we invest our time and money
in vacations to get away from problems and pressures, not to
compound them? What happened to basic human compassion and
understanding?
</P>
<P>
   Then I opened Houstonian Jo Anne Courtney's letter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HANDLING ADVERSITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She had called a couple of days earlier to tell me about her
experience this summer at the Kona Village Resort on the Big Island
of Hawaii. As she talked, I asked if she would put her thoughts in
writing so I could share them with fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Selfishly, I knew she would cheer me up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To celebrate our 47th wedding anniversary,'' her handwritten
letter began, ``my husband and I took our teen-age grandchildren
with us on a very special vacation _ to a resort with no air
conditioning, no telephones, no television and no clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to describe some of the resort's appeals: spacious
cottages built on stilts, with thatched roofs; winds sweeping
through the property; meals included in the basic room rate;
children's activities; a full recreational program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just one thing wrong with this plan,'' she wrote.
``I didn't get to do it. Two hours after arrival, my clogged
arteries decided to quit working. The classic pains in my left
shoulder radiating to my arm, jaw and chest let me know that I
needed the manager, fast!''
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance was called to take her to the nearest hospital, 45
minutes away. Jack Terry, the resort's resident manager, ``held my
hand and comforted me until it came,'' she wrote, ``and he said
that he would bring me home when I was released.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE THOUGHTFULNESS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After tests, Courtney was flown by air ambulance to a hospital
in Honolulu for further treatment. As she was about to be released,
a business trip took Terry to the state capital, and, the letter
continued, ``This kind man met me at my hospital room, drove me to
the airport, got a wheelchair for me and arranged for a taxi to
meet me at the Kona airport. He had even bought my airline ticket
and had it waiting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving back at the resort, the dining room was closed,
but a feast had been arranged for Courtney and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thoughtfulness didn't stop there,'' she wrote. ``The
resort took $200 a night off the room/meal rate for the nights when
I wasn't there. They have since written to find out how I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I received that letter, a colleague told me of her
experience during a recent Holland America cruise in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call in the middle of the night brought word that
her mother was seriously ill back home. She was advised to return
as soon as possible. Still at sea, the ship's staff set to work,
and by the time the vessel docked in Seward shortly after dawn,
flights home had been arranged _ no routine matter in such a small
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really appreciative,'' the colleague said.
</P>
<P>
   Even small gestures of goodwill can nourish us for years. I
remember a vacation in Kitzbuhel, Austria, in the dead of winter,
when my wife took ill and a housekeeper secured an extra blanket
and wrapped it around her, then set up a makeshift bed in front of
a warm fireplace. Just this summer in Australia, when I tarried too
long at the new Olympics complex 12 miles from downtown Sydney and
missed the last scheduled public transportation, a tour-bus driver
whose daily rotation had just ended sensed my predicament, said
``Hop aboard,'' and detoured four miles to a taxi stand. When I
offered a monetary thank-you, he refused.
</P>
<P>
   These people didn't know me. They had no idea what I do for a
living. They were just being nice.
</P>
<P>
   I never take it lightly when readers express their frustrations
at travel ills. I can only hope that next time they'll encounter a
Jack Terry in Kona, a concerned housekeeper in Kitzbuhel or a
gracious bus driver in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Good Samaritans do still exist all over the world.

NASA LOOKS TO NEXT GENERATION OF SPACE EXPLORERS: ROBOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A swarm of cunning robots _ some only several
inches wide _ soon may swarm, float, walk, swim, fly, creep, burrow
and hop across the alien worlds of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago, the world was enthralled by the
skateboard-sized Mars robot, Sojourner, venturing like an excited
puppy around the Red Planet, examining the soil and bumping into
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Sojourner looks like a lazy pooch compared to the futuristic
robo-critters being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A four-legged robot the size of a cigar box that will hop
around an asteroid like a grasshopper.
</P>
<P>
   _ A snakelike tube that will drill thousands of feet into the
Martian crust, seeking subsurface water and, perhaps, microbes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A two-legged walking robot under development at NASA's Ames
Research Center in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   _ A hot-air balloon with television cameras that would bob
through the atmosphere of the giant planet Jupiter. It would pass
above and survey multicolored mega-hurricanes bigger than Earth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiny helicopter-like robots able to maneuver through the
Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   _ A robotic submarine that would plunge into an icy ocean on
Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and seek life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the robots would be far smaller than today's space
probes. The drive toward smaller robotic probes is part of NASA
Administrator Daniel Goldin's push for ``smaller, cheaper, faster''
missions. The lighter the payload, the lower the cost of launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass reduction is very important because of the cost of the
launch vehicle,'' said Brian Wilcox, supervisor of the robot
vehicles group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, such cost-saving micro-gadgetry is potentially
threatened by proposed reductions in the NASA budget. The cuts to
robotic research and other space science projects ``would be
devastating,'' said Peter Norvig, who runs the computational
science division overseeing robotic development at the Ames
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   If the robotic program survives the budget cuts, a new breed of
explorers will soar skyward in the next decade or two. Because of
their diminutive size, they have been dubbed nanorobots or
``nanobots.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, NASA could cram numerous nanobots aboard a single
launch vehicle, then send them to Mars or another world.
</P>
<P>
   There, they would disembark and form a ``robot colony,'' said
Ames systems engineer Hamid Berenji. The colony could scout out in
different directions to survey the entire planet. Such fleets would
be mechanical versions of the great human terrestrial exploring
teams of the past, such as Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   At Ames, Berenji and biomechanical-electronics engineer Ron
Jacobs are developing a two-legged robot that walks with a normal
walking motion. It could navigate over rough terrain, such as the
rock-strewn, crater-scarred surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Berenji and Jacobs work for a NASA contractor, Intelligent
Inference Systems Corp. of Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   Ames researchers are developing a spherical robot that can float
aboard a spaceship and fly around using small propellers. Its
purpose is to allow a busy astronaut to check on an experiment in
another lab, or a potentially dangerous situation _ say, a gas leak
_ without getting directly in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Norvig said, it was called the Personal Satellite
Assistant, ``but no one liked that name.'' So it was renamed the
Spacecraft Micro-Robot, although some Ames researchers have
nicknamed it ``S2D2,'' or Space Shuttle Digital Droid.

   In a revealing interview in 1979, Jorge Luis Borges said that
``every writer leaves behind him two works: one, the written; the
other, the image that is left of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in the long run, the man's image erases the work.
</P>
<P>
   For today's readers, it is hard to read Borges without thinking
of the image of the man: the wise and blind old scholar who had an
answer for all the world's questions and who wandered through the
maze of his favorite library shelves, even though the books were
closed to his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When I started to read Borges, in my adolescence, what really
impressed me were the stories he told, the boundless variations of
his characters' identities and the infinite recreations of his
repertoire of facts.
</P>
<P>
   I felt that, for the first time since the Golden Century, the
Castilian tongue had found, in Borges' austere texts, the greatness
which had been dissipated by the minor regional writers. I felt
that, through Borges, the Argentinean language had acquired a
solidity and an intensity capable of expressing all the Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Once, during a Greek class, the professor found me reading ``The
Death and the Compass,'' and he reprimanded me in front of
everybody: ``Why do you spend your time reading an Argentinean
writer instead of Thucydides?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens that this one is better,'' I replied, fully
convinced my words were true.
</P>
<P>
   For adolescents of the '50s, Borges was, besides, a little-known
writer, a cult writer. We believed that even one of his short
stories or poems _ ``The Poem of the Gifts,'' for example, or the
moving ``Limits'' _ were worth all of the literature yet created.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, a professor at Rutgers University, who had
read only one of Borges' short stories _ ``The Search of
Averroes,'' translated into English _ told me that those few pages
were enough to make him worthy of the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   To read Borges, I thought, and not have the pleasure of his
masterpieces colored in any way by knowledge of the man, is an
enviable achievement now all but impossible for us Argentineans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, soon after he received the Formentor Award, Borges was
asked to select those texts which, in his opinion, best represented
him. The resulting slim volume, of less than 200 pages, was
published that same year by Editorial Sur, ``Personal Anthology.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prologue, Borges says, with a certain emphasis: ``My
preferences have dictated this book. I want to be judged by it,
justified or reproved by it.'' The order he chose was not
chronological, but based _ as Borges defined it _ on
``congenialities and differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the obvious short stories are there: ``The Death
and the Compass,'' ``The South,'' ``Funes the Mindful,'' ``The
Aleph,'' ``The Search of Averroes,'' ``The Circular Ruins'' and
``The End,'' even though at least three, equally worthy, are
missing: ``Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,'' ``Tloen, Uqbar,
Orbis Tertius'' and ``The Garden of the Paths that Bifurcate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the poems, one wonders at the absence of ``Mythological
Foundation of Buenos Aires'' whose ``apocryphal local color''
Borges once said he ``couldn't remember without blushing.''
</P>
<P>
   A second personal anthology, entrusted by him to Emece press,
did cover those voluntary omissions.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Borges many times in the '60s _ sometimes accompanying him
a couple of blocks and helping him cross the street _ and over the
next 20 years or so, I added a few texts to his ``Personal
Anthology'' of 1961 _ stories I deemed invaluable: ``The
Intruder,'' ``The Gospel, According to Mark,'' ``The Book of
Sand,'' ``Juan Lopez and John Ward,'' and his seminars about
blindness and the Kabbala, which are included in the ``Seven
Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, for four months, the only book I had with me was his ``The
Book of Sand,'' and those seven short stories were my only teacher.
I think in those few pages, and in his personal anthologies of 1961
and 1968, it's possible to find everything Borges was and always
will be.
</P>
<P>
   The last two times I saw Borges before he died in 1986, he no
longer was Borges, but his glory. The first time was in Venezuela.
He arrived silently, modestly, at the Ateneo of Caracas, and when
the lights were on him, overwhelming him, the public crowned him
with a 10-minute ovation.
</P>
<P>
   A Venezuelan writer standing by my side touched me with his
elbow and said: ``Look hard. He is Homer, he is Dante, he is all of
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later I found him again at George Mason University,
in Virginia, where thousands of silent, devoted students heard him
speak. I heard him say then that he dictated prologues and poems
when he was flying on airplanes, and that the applause of men is an
undeserved form of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   On those two occasions I was worried by the fact, which I later
confirmed, that many of those who applauded Borges had never read
Borges. Some guessed he had written ``Ulysses'' and had learned his
elegant English at Trinity College, in Dublin. Others, closer to
the mark, thought he was Cervantes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best homage to Borges in this centenary of his birth
is to forget the articles he wrote for newspaper deadlines and the
books he wrote in his youth _ which he later excluded from his
complete works _ and to read again the texts he asked to be
remembered by.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the works of every writer only a few pages remain: some
images, an indispensable stanza, an argument that is often repeated
by others who don't know they didn't create it. Borges exists
forever in his own immortal lines and not in the all-too-mortal
character which has been built by the years.

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
Seventy-two years ago, on Aug. 23, 1927, Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed in Massachusetts for a crime they
probably did not commit. The two Italian immigrants were hard
working men _ Sacco worked in a shoe factory, Vanzetti sold fish on
the docks. Neither men had a criminal record, nor were they
Communists. They were, however, pacifists and anarchists and had
avoided the draft during World War I.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those three elements convicted them of the murder of a paymaster
and a payroll guard in South Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Despite contradictory evidence, the two were found guilty in
July, 1921 and sentenced to death. An appeal was denied, even
though new evidence implicated other men. In his book ``An Almanac
of Liberty,'' former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas
wrote: ``They were convicted on the flimsiest evidence ... a
reading of the record years later leaves the impression that Sacco
and Vanzetti, charged with murder, were convicted because they were
pacifists, draft dodgers and radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1920s, the nation was convulsed with a fear of
Communist infiltrators. The federal government arrested and
deported thousands of immigrants who had come to our shores from
Europe because they were suspected of being in sympathy with
communism and Russia. The hysteria swept through communities and
states where newly arrived immigrants had taken jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard in this nation, Sacco and Vanzetti did not get a
fair trial. Unfortunately at that time, the Supreme Judicial Court
of Massachusetts had very limited powers of review. The court could
only review questions of law, not the weight of the evidence. It
could not consider the whole record of the case in order to weigh
whether an appeal was necessary. The court could not order a new
trial even when it felt that an injustice had been done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Sacco-Vanzetti case, that changed 12 years
later, after the hysteria against ``foreigners'' had abated. The
power of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was greatly
expanded in capital cases. According to Douglas, ``By an Act passed
in ((Aug. 25,)) 1939 it was granted review of the whole case _ of
the law and the evidence; and it was given the power to order a new
trial, if satisfied that justice required it. No longer was the
trial judge absolute master; no longer could his prejudice or
partisanship determine the fate of men.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here to consider. In the past decade, the U.S.
Supreme Court has consistently narrowed the right of a death row
inmate to appeal in federal courts _ whether or not new evidence
points to someone else as the murderer. This stricter limit on
appeals must inevitably lead to the execution of those who are
innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted and sentenced
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting appeals in capital punishment cases speeds up the
process from conviction to execution _ but often it is the very
length of time an inmate spends on death row that raises the odds
of a successful appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976 when the high court reinstated the death penalty, 82
death row inmates have been freed, but 566 were executed. How many
more were innocent?
</P>
<P>
   There are currently more than 3,500 men and women on death row
in this nation. How many are innocent?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt,
dissenting in the decision to allow Thomas Thompson to be executed
in California, wrote: ``In closing, I would observe that the
miscarriage of justice that is about to occur is the product of the
federal judiciary's elevation of procedure over justice, of speed
and efficiency over fairness and due process. I regret that we have
chosen that course in recent years, and believe that in doing so,
we have severely tarnished our nation's justice system.'' Thompson
was executed on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Dworkin, professor of law and philosophy at New York
University wrote in the Los Angeles Times, July 11 edition: ``The
Supreme Court has become impatient, and `super due process' has
turned into `due process-lite.' Its impatience is understandable,
but it is also unacceptable. If Americans insist on the death
penalty, they must accept the moral consequences of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges must listen, with painstaking and patient attention, to
every argument for life that is not plainly frivolous. If they find
any actual mistake in the process that has condemned a human being
to death, they must repeat that process and give him another chance
for life. These are inescapable moral demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we cannot meet these demands? What if we cannot
tolerate all the stays and appeals and retrials that a decent
respect for human life requires without making the law seem foolish
and without subverting the point of a death sentence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we must abandon capital punishment, even if we think it
right in principle, because then we cannot have it, even if it is
right, without cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 years in Illinois, 12 men have been executed
while 12 others on death row were exonerated. Illinois could take
pride in its judicial system regarding capital punishment, if those
12 inmates were freed by an appeals system that was working well.
However, that wasn't the situation in most of the successful
appeals; it was pure luck that saved the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Darby Tillis and Perry Cobb were convicted of robbing and
murdering two people at a hot dog stand in 1977. Years later, a
young lawyer who read a news story about their case, realized he
had worked with the state's star witness against Tillis and Cobb.
He remembered, too, that she had told him she and her boyfriend had
planned to rob the restaurant but the plan went awry and someone
was shot. In a new trial in 1987, Tillis and Cobb were found not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   David Protess, professor of journalism at Northwestern
University, and a few of his students helped free four men
convicted of gang rape and a double murder. Two of the men were on
death row; two were given life sentences. They had already spent 18
years behind bars. Protess and his students unearthed new evidence
and caused the witnesses to change their stories. Later three other
men confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Protess and his students also helped free a man who was only two
days away from execution after 17 years behind bars. Anthony Porter
had been convicted of a double murder. Protess and his team of
students gathered evidence that proved that Porter was innocent.
Key witnesses changed their testimony. And a Milwaukee man
confessed to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism professors aren't part of the judicial system. We
cannot count on the help of those outside the system to exonerate
those wrongfully convicted. Without Protess and his students, there
is little doubt that Anthony Porter would have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of realizing innocent people might have been
executed, Illinois _ with 156 inmates on death row _ has
temporarily put a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the Sacco-Vanzetti case is pivotal _ appeals
cannot and should not be arbitrarily limited. Streamling the
judicial process for capital punishment irrevocably streamlines
death for the innocent. And that price is too high, morally.

   EGGPLANT (Undated) _ In the eastern Mediterranean, the eggplant
is a beloved staple. It replaces meat in stews; it is sliced thin,
grilled and drizzled with fruity olive oil; it is charred, peeled
and blended into a silky, garlicky puree; it is layered with
tomatoes, onions and oil and baked until it is creamy and
caramelized. Eggplants are even cooked in sugar syrup and eaten as
a sweet. Such potential has not quite been realized in American
kitchens. And yet we now have more varieties than ever. Chefs use
all of them regularly _ especially this month and next when
eggplant are at the height of their season. By Amanda Hesser.

THE HOMER DERBY DETRACTS FROM THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Two good things can come from this season's
Sosa-McGwire sequel.
</P>
<P>
   One is variety: Sammy Sosa wins the home-run title this time,
toppling Goliath, tying or breaking Mark McGwire's record of 70.
</P>
<P>
   The other is monotony. The two sluggers make the public numb.
</P>
<P>
   Like a child gorged on cotton-candy, we lose our taste for the
home-run chase. We start to notice that all those dingers haven't
done much for the Cubs and Cardinals in the wins column. We still
like Sammy and Mac, but we start to look around at the other boys
of summer, and we notice something more interesting, more important
to the long-term well-being of the game.
</P>
<P>
   We notice the Oakland A's, aka The Team That Traded Mark McGwire
The Year Before He Broke Roger Maris' Home Run Record. They are
playoff contenders who look remarkably like baseball's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, it was Sammy and Mac to the rescue. They pulled so
many baseball expatriates back into the stands, back in front of
the televisions, back to the newspaper box scores. But the season
ended with a fizzle, a World Series sweep by the Yankees, a
franchise with a payroll bigger than McGwire's biceps.
</P>
<P>
   The little guy, it was clear, didn't have a chance. Rupert
Murdoch's minions dropped his millions on Kevin Brown at the winter
meetings, and baseball had three staggering record numbers for the
year: 70 for McGwire, 66 for Sosa, $105 million for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are the antidote to Murdoch's excesses. Their entire
team makes $22 million. Fewer people come to their games than show
up early for McGwire's batting practice. They aren't an attraction.
They are just a team, a winning team. They are, whether they
realize it or not, pushing aside Murdoch the way McGwire and Sosa
tracked down Maris. The difference is that Maris had a worthwhile
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   That is the story of this season: The pricey Dodgers stink.
</P>
<P>
   The bargain A's are amid the elite. So are the Cincinnati Reds,
another of baseball's discount squads.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that better, in the long run, than the individual glory of
a home-run record, especially one that may not hold up an entire
year? When they come and go so easily, records mean a whole lot
less. It's like caviar: If everyone could afford it, we'd just
spare the pretense and call the stuff fish eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a fair number of people are starting to agree that a
home-run fixation could hurt the game more than help it.
</P>
<P>
   I've argued this ever since Ken Griffey Jr. took so much flak
for vowing to skip the 1998 Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thought he was showing disrespect for the fans. I
thought he was showing respect for his sport.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's All-Star dunking competition started out as great fun,
just like the homer derby. After a while, it became the emblem of
everything wrong with the league. The NBA finally canned it. Too
many players had the style to dunk but not the substance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, everyone proclaimed baseball reborn, because of the
home run. I remembered the tedious playoff races and thought: Five
more years like this, and no one will ever want to watch baseball
again.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire were special last year. They could even be
special this year. But the A's and Reds' attack on free-spending
franchises is even better. If this happened every season, we would
never grow tired of it. In fact, we might become more entranced by
baseball than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the assumption is that free-agent spending dictates
success. At the beginning of the year, fans see white handkerchiefs
flying over small-market stadiums, and they turn off to the team
from the very beginning. The Giants helped counter that somewhat,
but even they have a generous payroll compared to the A's.
</P>
<P>
   If fans started to believe that every season, any team has a
chance to compete, there's more reason to start following any club
from spring training onward.
</P>
<P>
   And think of the lesson that an A's playoff appearance would
impart this season. A national television audience would hear how
this was the team that didn't have enough money to keep Mark
McGwire, traded the superstar and still found a way to become a
winner again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far better lesson than youngsters will glean from
watching how teams treat Sosa and McGwire these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't understand is why anyone's throwing them
strikes,'' said Matt Stairs, one of McGwire's former Oakland mates.
``Maybe it's just macho, the pitchers don't want to look like
they're backing down against them. But if I were up against them,
I'd throw in the dirt, four straight balls in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because he wants to win more than he wants to please a
stats-hungry crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker sounded like a rebel when he declared last weekend
that he would intentionally walk Sosa any time the Cubs slugger had
a chance to beat the Giants in this week's series at Wrigley Field.
He's not interested in being popular with the fans. He'll happily
walk McGwire, too.
</P>
<P>
   And the two sluggers have to know that Baker is showing them the
utmost respect with that approach. He fears their bats, and he
insists on treating them as ballplayers, not sideshow attractions
conducting glorified BP in the middle of a game.

THE REAL ENEMY IS HATRED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ One of my in-laws is a Chinese-American
postal worker in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   My sister said that when she saw television reports of shootings
at a Jewish child care center in north Los Angeles and the murder
of a ``non-white'' mailman, she immediately thought of our in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Our relative, of course, was not one of the victims in the
shootings that, according to the police, were proudly admitted by
neo-Nazi Buford O. Furrow Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, that moment of worry is part of a deeper emotional
response on my part, and perhaps on the part of many other
Americans who are not ``acceptable'' to the suspect and others who
think like him.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow reportedly told the authorities he saw Joseph Ileto, a
Filipino-American, as a ``target of opportunity'' because he was
``non-white'' and a federal government worker. Furrow, who has a
history of mental disturbances, is a white supremacist who despises
non-whites and government employees. He hates Jews. He stands
accused of killing Ileto for no other reason than Ileto's ethnic
background, and spraying shots inside the Jewish community center,
wounding an adult, a teen-ager and three children.
</P>
<P>
   My queasiness isn't just related to Furrow's madness. Other
recent hate crimes _ the arson fires of some Sacramento synagogues,
Benjamin Smith's shooting spree of African-Americans and
Asian-Americans in the Midwest _ weigh heavily on me too. They are
a reminder that no matter how American I may feel, there are some
Americans who will not see beyond my so-called ``non-white''
features. They see me, and others like me, and African-Americans,
and Latinos, and even ``white'' people who are Jews and ``white''
people who are gays and lesbians, as inferior or unworthy. They see
us as targets of opportunity _ to kill, to maim.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the vast majority of white Christian Americans _
i.e., the vast majority of Americans _ are not sick in the way that
Furrow is. But white supremacists do not believe in democratic
principles. In the aggregate, they may amount to a relatively
minuscule number, but as Furrow and Smith have shown, they strike
with deadly force, almost anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   That is what is so scary for a non-white American like me. At
one time, I thought that policy and legal responses such as gun
control could protect us. Furrow and Smith and others before them
used guns to express their inner demons.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are among the deadliest of weapons. So are bombs. Sure,
regulate them to the hilt, but there are so many guns in private
hands _ more than 200 million. And bombs are so easy to make
following step-by-step instructions off the Internet that reining
in these deadly weapons is not a practical solution to ridding
white supremacists of their hatreds.
</P>
<P>
   At some other point, I thought education would do the trick. But
what exactly does education mean to a Furrow or a Smith? They, and
others like them, got educated in ways that are completely foreign
to me.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, reason and logic hold no sway among white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a growing ``non-white'' population. Some
people naively trumpet our burgeoning multiculturalism as a
strength. If that is so, why then do Furrow and Smith, among
others, regard non-whites (and Jews and gays and lesbians) as ``mud
people'' to be exterminated?
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of rancid debate over identity politics
related to America's increasing multiculturalism, but most people
realize they are of multiple identities, whether related to race,
ethnicity, gender, age, generation, geography, work, etc. Furrow
and Smith are obsessed with a single identity _ as white Christian
extremists. That is more frightening, and more un-American, than
anything I have heard from people who celebrate multiculturalism.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Daughters' dads and bathroom stall tatics.
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, am I the only the only single father in America
who has to deal with this?
</P>
<P>
   I make sure my 6-year-old daughter goes before we leave the
house. We arrive at the theater, load up on popcorn, soda and
little candy bears. We find the two best seats in the house and
await the next Jim Henson spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when Miss Piggy is about to eat up a scene: ``Daddy,
I have to go!''
</P>
<P>
   We scramble out of the dark theater and race to the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The line to use the ladies' room snakes around the corner, but
that's not our destination. We rush into the men's room, find a
stall and ensure cleanliness, and then I leave her alone to
complete the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, such trips have drawn the ire and shock of some of the
men's room customers. Not the little boys, however _ they're too
busy concentrating on target management. It's adult men who are
freaking out.
</P>
<P>
   One man in his 40s said, ``Hey, this is a men's room.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking low enough so my daughter can't hear my selection of
juicy words, I proceed to tell the man of my fatherly
responsibility and question his desire to condemn my actions. After
a few minutes, he apologizes and admits he was wrong to question my
parental acumen.
</P>
<P>
   What did he think was going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a man would even think of something ``going
wrong,'' as one man said to me, is so perverse. What does he mean
by ``going wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter is a small child. She is blind to any sexual
overtones and there shouldn't be any in the bathroom anyway. The
little boys she quickly passes on the way to an unused stall are
not at all disturbed by her presence.
</P>
<P>
   Why are some men, and maybe some women, so put off by such a
simple action?
</P>
<P>
   We as a community don't even look twice when a mother takes her
6-year-old son into the ladies' room. Now, it's true that women
complete their missions behind closed doors, but why are they given
the benefit of the doubt as caretakers and dads aren't? My
intentions to care for my child are no different.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, it was true that friendly men and women
would help single parents by offering to usher the boys or girls to
their respective bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The sad reality is that in today's climate, when horrible acts
of cruelty are committed against children every day, I cannot risk
a stranger taking my child anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I once let a young woman take my daughter into the restroom of a
store. I waited just outside the door, listening for the slightest
sound of distress or trouble. It was the longest and most
nerve-racking four minutes of my life. Nothing happened, but if
something had occurred, I would have never forgiven myself.
</P>
<P>
   Should my need to protect my daughter subject me to suspicion
and condemnation? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   I know that my daughter soon will start seeking and be granted
total bathroom independence.
</P>
<P>
   We have discussed what to do if a stranger says or does
something she feels is not right almost as many times as I've read
Winnie the Pooh adventures to her at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   She'll fly solo very soon, and I won't have to deal with
uptight, nosy male jerks. But why did I ever have to?
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, we see commercials and newspapers ads every day in
this country that slam men for not taking an active role in their
children's lives. Do whatever it takes to protect and nurture your
child, the messages bellow.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what dads like me have been doing?

   We have discussed what to do if a stranger says or does
something she feels is not right almost as many times as I've read
Winnie the Pooh adventures to her at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   She'll fly solo very soon, and I won't have to deal with
uptight, nosy male jerks. But why did I ever have to?
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, we see commercials and newspapers ads every day in
this country that slam men for not taking an active role in their
children's lives. Do whatever it takes to protect and nurture your
child, the messages bellow.

<P>
   Isn't that what dads like me have been doing?

 &HT;    PARENTS THINK THEIR OWN CHILD'S SCHOOL IS SAFE
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's school shootings did not shake parents'
faith in the safety of their local schools, according to a national
Gallup poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming 92 percent of parents with children in their
local public schools and 84 percent of other adults described the
local learning environment as ``very'' or ``somewhat'' safe and
orderly.
</P>
<P>
   When parents were asked specifically about the public school
attended by their oldest child, only 7 percent said they were
sending their son or daughter to an unsafe school. Instead, 42
percent described it as ``very safe and orderly'' and 50 percent
called it ``somewhat safe and orderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Local pride in the overall quality of schools also remains
strong, according to the poll, the 31st annual public education
survey conducted for Phi Delta Kappa International, an
Indiana-based association of more than 100,000 professional
educators in 15 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Offered a chance to grade schools, 56 percent of the
public-school parents and 47 percent of the other adults gave an A
or B to their local schools. But only only 21 percent of the
parents and 26 percent of others awarded an A or B to schools ``in
the nation as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
occurred April 20. The poll of 1,103 adults, which had a sampling
error of plus or minus two percentage points, was conducted from
May 18 to June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there is nothing in this poll to suggest that there
was a significant change in public attitudes as a result of the
Columbine shootings,'' said the poll's director, Lowell Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents came to the schools right afterwards and
said, 'How are you ensuring the safety of our children?''' said Jim
Fogarty, a school official in Suffolk County, N.Y., who is the
incoming president of Phi Delta Kappa International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many visitors were reassured by what they saw of the safety
net features that were in place,'' he said. ``Some programs were
tightened up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the public wants schools to be even safer, said Jack
Jennings, executive director of the Washington-based Center for
Education Policy.
</P>
<P>
   That desire showed up in the answers to an open-ended question
in which the pollsters asked people to name ``the biggest problems
with which the public schools of your community must deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the top two concerns were lack of
discipline or need for more control (mentioned by 18 percent this
year and 14 percent last year) and fighting, violence or gangs (11
percent this year, 15 percent last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, people still want more discipline within the
schools,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters asked parents of public-school children and other
adults two multiple-choice questions on school safety.
</P>
<P>
   All were asked the first question: ``Thinking about the public
schools in your community, how would you describe the learning
environment?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers were ``Very safe and orderly,'' parents 30 percent;
others, 22; ``Somewhat safe and orderly, parents 62, others 62;
``Not very safe and orderly,'' parents 5, others 8; ``Not at all
safe and orderly,'' parents 2, others 3; ``Don't know,'' parents,
1; others, 5.
</P>
<P>
   The one-third of the respondents who had children in public
schools then were asked: ``How about the learning environment in
the public school your oldest child attends?''
</P>
<P>
   The percentages were ``very'' (42 percent), ``somewhat'' (50),
``not very'' (5), ``not at all'' (2) and ``don't know'' (1).
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the poll can be viewed on the Web site of Phi
Delta Kappa International (http://www.pdkintl.org).

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay Area's own Richard North Patterson once
again proves that he is at the top of his game. His latest richly
textured legal thriller, ``Dark Lady'' (Random House, $25.95, 371
pages), begins with the bizarre deaths of two of Steelton's most
prominent men _ ``the drug dealers' lawyer of choice,'' Jack Novak,
and Tommy Fielding, the general manager of the firm building a
baseball stadium for the Steelton Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding had been found naked in his bedroom, next to a black
prostitute. Both apparently died of drug overdoses. But Fielding's
mother insists that her son was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Novak had been found hanging from his closet door, wearing a
garter belt and stockings. It could have been a sex act that went
wrong, but Novak had been castrated, making it a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases will prove to be the ultimate test for Assistant
County Prosecutor Stella Marz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six years, she had won every case but one _ a hung
jury following the murder trial of a high school coach who had
gotten one of his students pregnant and who, devastated by Stella's
particularly ruthless cross-examination, had committed suicide. It
was this which had led a courtroom deputy to give Stella a nickname
which now enjoyed wide currency among the criminal defense bar: the
Dark Lady. But only recently had they become aware of her ambition,
long nurtured, to become the first woman elected prosecutor of Erie
County.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve her goal, she must help her boss, Arthur Bright, win
the mayoral race against the hugely popular Mayor Krajek. And to do
this, she must distance Bright from his ties to Novak _ his old
classmate, friend and campaign contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her investigation begins, an anonymous caller
tells a reporter that Stella had been Novak's lover. However, the
affair occurred 13 years before when Stella worked for Novak while
she was going to law school.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Stella plunges ahead with the cases. When one of
Stella's witnesses is killed, Stella is convinced that Fielding was
murdered and she begins an investigation of the money behind the
baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Stella's life will be threatened, her beloved cat killed, and
eventually she will begin to trust no one.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Patterson's character development is first rate. He
deftly defines the complexities of a declining city's politics and
the underhanded maneuvers in getting a stadium built. The plot is
well- paced, and the dialogue rings true.
</P>
<P>
   In his acknowledgements at the end of the book, Patterson says
``Steelton is not Cleveland _ it's what Cleveland might have become
had its people not decided otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard for the reader not to substitute Cleveland for
Steelton throughout the book because Patterson ``borrowed'' so much
of that city's history in creating Steelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Lady'' is sure to be a bestseller.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``High Time to Kill.'' By Raymond Benson. G.P. Putnam's Sons.
$23.95. 255 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Benson is no Ian Fleming, but he captures the spirit and pluck
of Fleming's OO7 in this high-flying spy thriller.
</P>
<P>
   While on vacation in the Bahamas with his latest lover, Bond
saves the life of the governor, who has been targeted by a new
terrorist group known as the Union.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret British lab, scientists are developing Skin 17, a
material for the frame of an airplane that will allow it to reach
previously unattainable airspeeds. A member of the British Secret
Service kills the head of the scientific team and gives the Union a
microdot containing the formula for Skin 17. MI6 learns that the
courier carrying the microdot was on a plane that crashed in the
Himalayas, and Bond is sent to recover the microdot.
</P>
<P>
   I started reading ``High Time to Kill'' just after seeing the
IMAX film ``Everest,'' and I'm sure that influenced the fun I had
reading the parts of the book that dealt with scaling a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Benson provides lots of blood and guts, sex and derring-do.
``High Time'' is a perfect read for a plane ride or an afternoon at
the beach.

<P>
   ``Cleopatra's Needle.'' By Steven Siebert. Forge. $23.95. 168

</P>
<P>
   Siebert's debut thriller could have been top-notch. But the
intriguing plot goes awry due to terrible construction.

   Archaeologist Dan Rawlins is doing research at New York's

McKay, who says he works for Sotheby's. McKay shows Rawlins a photo
of a damaged ankh and asks if the Met's collection has the other
half.
</P>
<P>
   Checking the museum's catalog, Rawlins finds a match to the
damaged ankh. But when McKay offers to buy the museum's half,
Rawlins knows McKay has a hidden agenda and brushes him off.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlins later sends his assistant, Marce, to retrieve the ankh.
The next day, Marce is found mutilated at the base of Cleopatra's
Needle in Central Park. Rawlins' father is found brutally murdered
near his beach house, and the younger Rawlins also is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, Mossad agent Jacinda El-Bahri has retrieved
the damaged half of the ankh from a terrorist group planning to use
the relic's legendary power to further its cause.
</P>
<P>
   After her hideout in Cairo is bombed, Jacinda flees to Port Said
and books passage on the first departing merchant ship. After a
brief nap, she awakens to find the ship dead in the water and only
one other person on board.
</P>
<P>
   Then the story moves back thousands of years to ancient Egypt to
tell the tale of the ankh. And after 119 pages, the story returns
to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother with ``Cleopatra's Needle.'' It's a mess.

A HOUSE IN THE WOODS WHERE BUSY PEOPLE DEVELOP `A LISTENING
HEART'

<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the Minnesota woods, there is an unusual little house-- a
place called the House of Prayer. It is, like thousands of other
such places, a church retreat center.
</P>
<P>
   Its unique mission, however, is to cultivate contemplative
prayer and help busy people develop ``a listening heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, I discovered the House of Prayer and was drawn
by its simplicity. Owned by the Episcopal Church and situated on
the grounds of St. John's Benedictine Abbey, the House of Prayer
sits at the juncture of farmland and woods 90 miles north of the
Twin Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Its peace served as a counterbalance in my life during a hectic
year of commuter-marriage. Since then, especially during stressful
times, I find myself thinking of the house in the woods and wishing
I were there.
</P>
<P>
   When business recently took me to Minnesota, I returned for an
afternoon at the House of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, there was a new addition to the little house: an
Oratory. An oratory is a small chapel devoted to personal prayer.
But this particular oratory was unlike any I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The outside looks like a tiny church and forms the shape of the
cross. But the cruciform is not obvious on the inside. Instead, the
oratory's main room is round. The ceiling is low around the edge of
the room and then soars in a teepee-shaped vault to skylights.
</P>
<P>
   The space is very plain-- only a few removable icons-- its
austerity relieved by texture, color and light. Traditional
Christian symbols are absent. Less traditional onesborrowed from
Buddhist and American Indian sacred traditions help furnish the
oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are unapologetically Christian in our life,'' says the Rev.
David Keller, director of the House of Prayer, ``but we welcome
others.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, the word ``oratory'' conjures images of
speech and speech-making. But in this place, I fell into hushed
silence knowing I had found sacred ground. I did not want to talk.
I wanted to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``An oratory is a place to speak and listen,'' explained Keller.
Here, speaking and listening to Godand the inner prompting of one's
soulthrough meditation is the goal. As Keller said, the building
``leads beyond itself into the heart of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oratory is grounded in a particular tradition-- that of
Benedictine spirituality. Although it originated fifteen hundred
years ago, many contemporary churchgoers have picked up Benedictine
ideals and found them helpful for modern spiritual concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Norris's best-selling books exude Benedictine
spirituality. Less well-known writers, such as Joan Chittester and
Esther deWaal, have found devoted audiences for their books on
practical Benedictine life.
</P>
<P>
   Popular author Thomas Moore described the Benedictine vision as
``profoundly contemplative and thoroughly communal.'' Perhaps the
balance between private meditation and life in the world is
precisely its appeal in its current revival.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Benedictine spirituality comes from the first word
in St. Benedict's Rule: ``Listen.'' Benedictine life assumes there
is a God who is speaking, a presence who wants human beings to
listen: ``What is more delightful than this voice of the Lord
calling us? See how the Lord in love shows us the way of life!''
</P>
<P>
   That Benedictine spirituality, with its emphasis on listening,
should be finding its way into American religion strikes me as
oddly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   It is odd, of course, because American religion has never been
particularly good at listening. Preaching, yes. Good deeds, yes.
Talking and doing have been the hallmarks of American piety.
Americans are quick to tell others what to believe and slow to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, and in the strangest places, we hear of listening.
Politicians are not making speeches. They conduct ``listening
tours.'' Some denominations have declared moratoriums on talking
about issues and have instead proclaimed ``Jubilee'' years to
listen to concerns in their midst. Management professionals urge
executives to spend up to a year listening to their employees
before implementing new policies.
</P>
<P>
   There's something spiritual in all this-- largely unnoticed, but
very real. Perhaps we have discovered that noise, the shouts of our
preachers, pundits, and politicians, have done nothing to solve our
deepest problems.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if we stop and listento God, to ourselves, to one
anotherwe can chart a new course for our society.
</P>
<P>
   We have discovered we do not need oratory as much as we need the
Oratory.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the Oratory, one of the carpenters on the
project remarked, ``I'm not looking forward to going back to
working on strip malls.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe when we finally listen, that is what we will all hear.
There is more to our work and our lives than strip malls.

<P>
   Look out, Judge Judy. Judge Othniel is in the house. And he's
not dealing in small claims.
</P>
<P>
   Othniel, fresh from the Old Testament's Book of Judges, is a
featured player on ``Twice in a Lifetime,'' a new Pax TV series
premiering Wednesday night at 8 on KWPX. In Othniel's courtroom,
supplicants on their way to the hereafter get a hearing to
determine if they deserve a second chance at life. Thus, a ``life
sentence'' from Othniel (played avuncularly by Al Waxman) is a good
thing, assuming the plaintiff isn't thrilled with the idea of being
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to each case is a ``caretaker of souls,'' a sort of
celestial public defender who argues on behalf of the plaintiff and
then, back on Earth, acts as a guide to help the person see where
he went astray. One such caretaker is young Mr. Jones, the main
facilitator on ``Twice in a Lifetime.'' Each week, in the manner of
a latter-day Mr. Roarke from ``Fantasy Island,'' he guides a new
character on a return trip to real life and a chance to get it
right the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   A syrupy combination of ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Quantum
Leap,'' ``Twice in a Lifetime'' moves more slowly than a line at
the DMV. If this is family viewing, America's families will have to
be treated for early-onset drowsiness on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's episode is about a woman (Gwyneth Walsh) who gave up
her first child for adoption when she was 16. Now 46 and an
alcoholic who's a rotteand mother, she gets a second chance
to confront her teenage decision. There's just one twist: She
doesn't go back as herself at 16; she goes back as an adoption
counselor, coming face to face with herself.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting contrivance, but not even a surprise ending
can keep ``Twice in a Lifefrom overcoming its own sluggish
pace. Walsh is pleasant enough as the first plaintiff in Othniel's
court, and Gordie Brown, who is a Las Vegas comedian when he's not
playing Mr. Jones, is youthful and charming as a world-wise
guardian angel. The writing isn't even particularly heinous. But in
its first incarnation, ``Twice in a Lifetime'' is just plain
boring, which is interesting in a way, because Pax TV rejected the
original pilot as being too dark.
</P>
<P>
   In that version, the judge was Jephthah, also played by Waxman,
but he was meaner and his court was a scary place. It also had a
nasty prosecutor who fought against a second chance for the
plaintiff (and in one instance succeeded in getting a person
dispatched to hell).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's not family viewing, but, trust me, it's a lot more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in a Lifetime. Hourlong anthology series about people
getting a second chance to shape their own destinies. Starring
Gordie Brown, with special guest performers each week. Season
premiere Wednesday night at 8, KWPX. Parental guideline rating:

 &HT;    TAX CUT PLAN COULD HAVE BROAD ECONOMIC EFFECT
 &HT;    840&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Democrats and Republicans battle over how much
to cut federal taxes, analysts disagree over whose plan is better
for the economy. But they do agree that the cuts could have a
tremendous long-term impact on the country.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns to work after Labor Day, Republicans plan
to send President Clinton their already-approved plan to cut taxes
by $792 billion over 10 years. It would trim income tax rates
across the board, as well as estate taxes, capital gains taxes, and
the ``marriage penalty'' that causes some couples to pay more tax
than if they filed as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly promised to veto the GOP plan. His own
proposal is for $320 billion in tax cuts aimed at low- and
middle-income workers. That would be partly offset by $70 billion
in new revenue from closing loopholes in the corporate tax code, a
strategy businesses call a tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   The president also wants to set aside $374 billion over 10 years
to shore up Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the
elderly, and to spend roughly $100 billion more on education,
worker training and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would tap $1 trillion in projected budget surpluses
over the next decade _ if they actually appear, which many experts
doubt _ while agreeing to save another $2 trillion in excess Social
Security and Medicare taxes for future spending on those programs.
</P>
<P>
   With the tax dispute coming to a head, advocates for each
approach are pointing to the potential economic benefits _ and
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the larger Republican plan is that ``tax cuts
do create, or do free up, capital and investment and spending in
ways that do stimulate the economy,'' said Glenn Yago, director of
capital studies at the Milken Institute, an economic research group
in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Economic stimulus, in turn, helps create jobs and raise incomes
across all socio-economic levels, Yago maintained.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent the economy needs better educated workers, he
said, private industry can do a better job than government, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that do require a higher level of
investment currently, particularly in the education area,'' said
Yago. ``The temptation (in Washington) is to fund it through the
enormously inefficient mechanisms of government, which would
squander that wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Others counter that the stimulus of a large tax cut might better
be applied in times of recession than in times of economic health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you would want to do a tax cut. This is
not one of them,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director for the
Concord Coalition, a Washington research and advocacy group
dedicated to reducing the national debt. ``The economy doesn't need
a tax cut right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another argument against big tax cuts is that they threaten to
scuttle debt reduction and force needed government programs onto a
deficit-era austerity diet, said Michael Calabrese, director of
domestic policy programs for the Center for National Policy, a
liberal-leaning research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall impact will be to starve government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the tax cut debate might have less effect on
the economy than on congressional and presidential politics next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even the larger Republican tax cuts, for example, would amount
to less than $5 billion when they start phasing in next year _ less
than one-tenth of 1 percent the size of a U.S. economy expected to
produce a gross domestic product (GDP) of $8.5 trillion in goods
and services this year.
</P>
<P>
   But ``by the time you get to the year 2008, you're looking at
cuts of $168 billion,'' said Henry Aaron, senior fellow for
economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
research group.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, ``it's a tax cut of a percent and a half of
GDP,'' said Aaron, ``which is a significant change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tax cut gets into really serious money _ $3
trillion, the Treasury Department estimates _ over the second
decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The current debate brings the Republican philosophy of lower
taxes and less government into direct conflict with Democratic
preferences for a higher level of government services.
</P>
<P>
   How the dispute is resolved could have a tremendous long-term
impact on the country's economic prospects, analysts from both
sides of the political spectrum agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate over the tax bill,'' said Aaron, ``is one of those
watershed debates on the direction in which budget policy will go
over the next decade or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar turning points in the past have had profound effects on
the economy. President Reagan's tax cuts and military spending
increases in the early 1980s are credited with providing a powerful
boost to the national economy _ and record federal budget deficits
a few years later. President Bush's unpopular tax increases in the
early 1990s are seen by many as setting the foundation for the
decade's long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes so high and the prospects so uncertain, many
analysts say neither Clinton's approach nor the Republicans' is all
that attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Simply holding the line on spending and taxes would do far more
for the country than either large spending hikes or sizable tax
cuts, said the Concord Coalition's Bixby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that there's so much partisan bitterness that they
won't be able to make a deal,'' said Bixby. ``They should dare to
do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   If taxes and spending are left largely unchanged, whatever
surplus does accrue in the years ahead would go mostly toward
reducing the $3.6 trillion the federal government now owes to banks
and other investors, the so-called public portion of the country's
$5.6 trillion debt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that if
Congress and the White House simply stick to the spending caps set
forth in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, and leave the tax
structure as it is, public debt would fall to $865 billion by the
year 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 40 percent of today's GDP, the public debt would fall
to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2009, the CBO figures.
</P>
<P>
   For a country that spent an entire generation racking up the
largest national debt in world history, that would mark a stunning
achievement. In addition to driving down the amount the government
pays in interest costs _ $229 billion this year alone _ many
economists contend it would substantially boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the reduction that is occurring in the federal
debt at this stage, as a consequence of the ongoing surplus, is an
extraordinarily effective force for good in this economy,'' Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told the House Banking
Committee in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a major factor in expansion of economic growth,''
said Greenspan, who went on to plead with the panel's members not
to do anything to impede the trajectory of the long-awaited deficit
relief. ``Let the surpluses run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming, of course, that the projected surpluses
actually materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no surplus that we can really count on,'' claims
Calabrese of the Center for National Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the projections of a $1 trillion surplus over 10 years,
not counting excess Social Security and Medicare taxes, depend on
three rather shaky assumptions:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, that the economy _ already eight years into one of the
largest peacetime expansions in the nation's history _ will
continue to grow at better than 2 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, that Congress and the White House will stick to the
spending caps set by the 1997 balanced budget deal. The Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and policy
group, estimates that holding to the caps would require $775
billion worth of spending cuts over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of $775 billion over 10 years in cuts is utterly
unreal,'' the center's executive director, Robert Greenstein said.
``Neither party has the stomach for deep cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, that Congress won't break the bank with bookkeeping
gimmicks such as so-called emergency spending _ like the $4 billion
Republicans have called for to pay for next year's national census.
</P>
<P>
   In short, history and political horse sense suggests that the
projected surpluses may not survive the budgeting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were telling me you were going to lose 20 pounds by
Christmas, and you were eating a banana split in front of me,''
explained Bixby, ``I might not believe you.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Everything's OK in Prague
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ The worst thing in the world is to
offend folks when you had no intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   So it has happened, all because of a story I wrote from the
capital of the Czech Republic a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the first few paragraphs to give you an idea:
</P>
<P>
   ``Prague is a city intoxicated on freedom, and that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to meet someone along the street smoking a
joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the finest restaurants in Prague is just a block from
an open drug market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be sitting in a restaurant and, instead of a waiter,
it's a drug dealer who comes to your table to ask what he can bring
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, so does the weather girl on TV, who appears totally
nude and then begins to dress herself accordingly for the next
day's weather. On occasion, it's an equally naked weather boy.''
</P>
<P>
   And it goes on from there.
</P>
<P>
   I have since received e-mail correspondence informing me I have
caused great consternation among a number of people, two or three
at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   The writer notes, ``I am not a reader of yours,'' which is as
good a way as any to get a writer's attention, ``but was sent one
of your opinions by my sisters ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Prague is by no means what you have described by your column.
... We have been living here for seven years and are very happy to
have joined this community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here have gone out of their way to assist us in
some of the worst times of our lives and we are thankful for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer goes on to ask that if I could clarify my earlier
comments, ``I and my fellow townspeople would appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not think your column is widely read,'' a further
attention-grabber, ``but you never can tell what gets around to
where.''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes on a conciliatory note: ``We host the Prague
Kolachi Festival every year the first weekend in May. You may want
to join us next May and become familiar with our people.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I say? I apologize to the writer, to her sisters and to
all the good people of Prague, Okla., for any misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   One other item from the mail. I had written about the little
hotel where I always try to stay when I'm in Paris, a delightful
spot on the Left Bank, just around the corner from the Pantheon, a
short way from the Sorbonne and an easy walk to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   With a bistro on most every corner, a bakery right across the
street and even a coin-operated laundromat in the next block, it's
very much a neighborhood in itself.
</P>
<P>
   What I forgot to include, and any number of readers have written
asking, was the name of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Hotel Claude Bernard, 43 rue des Ecoles. You can find
detailed information on the Claude Bernard and scores of other
small hotels in Fodor's ``Hotels of Character and Charm in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   I hasten to add, that's Paris, France, not Paris, Texas.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Oh, Genesis! Oh, evolution!

<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose every religion has its fundamentalists, although I've
never heard of a Buddhist one. Believe every word of it, they say,
while the rest of us interpret scripture to suit our convenience.
Holding firm keeps a lot of folks honest.
</P>
<P>
   Believing is a matter of purest faith for fundamentalists. If
the Bible says God created the world in seven days, that's the way
it happened, no changes, no slippery interpretations. That's where
fundamentalism runs smack into evolution, which holds that creation
took billions of years and has a lot of complications Genesis never
mentioned: Dinosaurs. Ice Age. Cave folk. Funny turtles. I think
God had larger things in mind, like how we should behave as
children of God.
</P>
<P>
   For myself, I've never had a problem holding both creation ideas
in mind. I think God, in Her wisdom, created evolution, which, from
tiniest nuclear particle to farthest space dust, is a more
glorious, elegant accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kansas Board of Education says kids there don't have to
hear about all those glories. The problem I have with
fundamentalists of all flavors is that they want the freedom to
believe, then want to fix it so that the rest us can't.

 &HT;    DUBLIN'S URBAN COWBOYS FIGHTING TO KEEP THEIR HORSES, WAY OF
LIFE
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ On a patch of green beside the dreary gray
Ballymun towers here, horse and rider leap effortlessly over an
obstacle fashioned from a discarded plank resting on two stacks of
old tires.
</P>
<P>
   Cairin McElligott, 15, rides Jasmine bareback with little effort
and much grace. He tugs the reins to turn Jasmine for another
attempt and taps her flanks with the sides of his sneakers. Again,
horse and rider are flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a large van parked on the road by the narrow grassy
strip enjoys a steady flow of people through its side door. It's a
mobile methadone clinic making a stop to serve the heroine addicts
among the vast government housing complex's 20,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people emerging from the van stop to take in the
free display of equestrian skills.
</P>
<P>
   It is a show whose days may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the poor people of Ballymun and other government
housing complexes around Dublin have had their horses. But growing
concern about the welfare of Dublin's urban horses has placed the
Ballymun riders on the road to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of owning a horse and keeping it in a play yard, a
football pitch or in the back garden are over,'' said Maurice
Byrne, the chief inspector for the Dublin Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ``There's no place for it in this
day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vicky McElligott, Cairin's mother, is vowing to fight to
keep the horses at Ballymun.
</P>
<P>
   McElligott admits that this bleak, litter-strewn place is less
than an ideal home for the horses, but she is equally aware of the
ugly realities represented by the methadone van.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses are a way a boy can raise his expectations,'' says
McElligott, the mother of nine. ``Maybe the horses don't keep them
from the selling or using of drugs, but they do give them a focus:
Taking care of an animal as big as a horse is a responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries that horse protection laws passed in recent years on
the national and local level soon will bring an end to ownership by
poor and working-class people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be just for the rich,'' she says.
``Multi-million pounds are spent on those horses. The manure from
those horses is worth more than our horses.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which date to 1996, require horse owners to license
their animals. They make it illegal for anyone under 16 to own a
horse, and authorities can impound horses not kept in stables.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that animal control officers will carry off their horses
at night, Ballymun residents keep vigilant watch over the horses
from the high-rise windows. About 120 horses live in and around
Ballymun, less than half the population of five years ago. Across
Dublin, there may be 3,000 urban horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're illegal, there's no denying that,'' McElligott says,
glancing at the half-dozen horses tethered to stakes in the green
patch. More horses graze on a nearby soccer field, and even more
are kept in a stand of trees near the towers.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the horses at Ballymun varies from well-fed
and groomed _ generally those kept at the stable _ to rangy and
unkempt. Some are shoeless.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The urban horses have received a good deal of attention in the
local and national media and have been portrayed _ some say
romanticized _ in the films ``The Commitments'' and ``Into the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unforgettable scenes in the latter featured a
horse, a small boy and, an erratic elevator servicing one of
Ballymun's towers. ``You're not bringing that in here,'' complains
one of the film's main characters to the boy standing with his
horse. ``The stairs would kill him,'' the boy replies indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   To McElligott, this struggle is more than a battle over the
right to ownership. She depicts it as a battle over culture and her
right to retain her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Horses long have had a special place in the Irish psyche, so it
is not surprising that people held on to them when they began
taking up residence in places such as Ballymun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you. Look at the tower blocks,'' she says. ``Irish
people were never meant to live in the sky. That's half the problem
here.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of staving off official action, the Ballymun residents
have organized the Ballymun Horse Owners Club. Members must
contribute a few pounds and attend meetings, and they board their
horses in a hastily converted pub that lay abandoned for years. The
club has shows and races in which it competes with clubs from other
housing projects. The races often generate kitties of more than
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the former pub, horses poke their heads out through holes
knocked through the cinderblock walls. A cat with a mouse in its
mouth hunts for privacy as chickens and ducks squabble in a corner.
A half-dozen kids between 11 and 15 clean the stall floors, which
are covered with straw and sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Barnes, 36, instructs 11-year-old Brian Boyle on the finer
points of cleaning mud from a shoed hoof. ``Mind the quick,''
Barnes says. ``That's it. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who loves to race his horses, says he's taught himself
how to care for the animals. ``The horse will teach you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, the DSPCA chief inspector, has no doubt that many people
in Ballymun love their horses and do their best for them. However,
he believes the horses in the stable are not representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are horses that are left tethered on a rope in the
football pitch in the open, even in winter,'' he says. ``The boys
ride them bareback, not realizing that this is very painful to the
horse, with the hard seams in their jeans. They will get up in the
morning and ride their horses have dinner and go and ride them
again like the hammers of hell. And then at night others will ride
them too. The horses are exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   McElligott acknowledges that there are problems, but she insists
that people who treat their horses well should not be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she knows that the situation as it is, cannot last.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could come in today and close us down and take the horses
away,'' she says, watching her son and his horse make one more
jump. ``They want to annihilate this way of life.''

   Mount Horrocks Clare Valley Late-Harvest Riesling 1998,
Southeast Australia. About $18.
</P>
<P>
   No one can resist a sweet dessert wine. I'm not talking about
some sugary plonk fortified with 20 percent alcohol; it's easier to
knock yourself out with a hammer. No, I'm referring to the viscous,
golden late-harvest wines made entirely from overripe grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The best are the sauvignon-semillion blends of Sauternes and the
rieslings of Germany, Alsace and Austria. American versions often
lack the acid needed to balance the sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   This riesling from Australia is the nearest thing I've come to a
great German beerenauslese, a rare late-harvest wine that usually
commands a high price. The winemaker, Stephanie Toole, achieves a
balance of high sugar and intense acid that they'd be proud of in
the Rheingau. A connoisseur's confection.

   This is the time of year for straightforward tomato dishes, ones
that take advantage of the fantastic spectrum making its way to
farm stands and produce markets in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the best of these dishes are barely cooked, or not cooked
at all. The less you cook a peak-of-summer tomato, the more you can
appreciate its marvelous, fruity flavor. A vivid yellow tomato
soup, simmered for just a few minutes, then pureed and chilled, is
a perfect example. The brief simmering helps the tomatoes release
their juices and meld the ingredients. But the flavors remain pure
and sweet, without that vague cold spaghetti sauce taste of many
tomato soups.
</P>
<P>
   While you can use any color of tomato for this soup, I like the
look of the yellow ones. They are also milder and less acidic than
their red cousins, and make a better match for herbs and spices.
But this soup is really about the tomatoes, so I use a light hand _
just a touch of toasted whole coriander and cumin.
</P>
<P>
   The coriander shows up again as an herb in the garnish _ a
relish inspired by Mexican salsa. The relish is uncooked, and it
brings a crunchy texture to the smooth soup. Bits of jalapeno are
like sparks on the tongue, contributing just enough heat to
accentuate the coolness of the soup. I use red tomatoes in the
relish, for their more assertive flavor, which stands up to the
jalapeno, and for a contrasting color.
</P>
<P>
   This soup couldn't be simpler to prepare. Since it's strained
after being cooked, you don't have to peel or seed or even core the
tomatoes _ just cut them into chunks and throw them into a pot. The
soup needs to be made several hours in advance so it can chill and
the flavors can develop. Prepare it in the morning, or even the day
before serving, but not any further ahead or it will lose its
freshness. The relish, too, can be made a few hours before serving,
but not more than three, or the tomatoes will turn flabby. Not a
fitting end for the tomato you've been waiting for all year.
</P>
<P>
   YELLOW TOMATO SOUP WITH CILANTRO-ONION RELISH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 4 hours' chilling
</P>
<P>
   For the soup:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   6 large yellow tomatoes, cut into rough cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon whole coriander seed
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon whole cumin seed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon freshly ground black pepper For the relish:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red tomato, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   { cup finely chopped red onion
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the soup, heat olive oil in a large pot over medium
heat. Add the onions and garlic, and saute until they are
translucent, about 5 minutes. Do not let them brown (if they start
to color, add a tablespoon of water). Add the tomatoes and saute
for 5 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, toast the coriander and cumin
over medium high heat until they are fragrant and lightly browned,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Add them to the tomatoes, along with 2 cups
water.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bring the tomato mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and
simmer for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn off the heat, and let the soup cool slightly. Puree with
an immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor. Strain,
and discard the solids. Chill the soup until cold, at least 4
hours. 5. When ready to serve, make the relish: in a small bowl,
mix together all the relish ingredients. Season the soup with lemon
juice, salt and pepper. Garnish with relish, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

`AMERICAN CULTURE, AMERICAN TASTES': WHEN LOWBROW BUMPS INTO
HIGHBROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Kammen is one of the better-known historians practicing
these days. His book ``People of Paradox'' won the Pulitzer Prize
in 1973; his later ``Mystic Chords of Memory,'' in which he teased
out the various uses and misuses of the American past, was greeted
with reverential reviews. Kammen, in other words, has the sort of
reputation that makes one expect something complex and strong from
his books, and this expectation certainly holds for his new one,
``American Culture, American Tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways a natural continuation of ``Mystic Chords of
Memory,'' the new book is an extended commentary on the fate of
culture in a modern democracy. As always with Kammen, it is
prodigiously researched and impressively erudite. Its main topic is
the transformation of American culture from the time when what
Kammen calls popular culture was dominant to the present ascendancy
of mass culture. It covers other matters as well: the relationship
between the ``high'' culture and the ``low,'' the way the two have
permeated each other, and how their intimate relationship has been
proclaimed and denounced by various historians and critics over the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kammen's learned treatment of a good topic, there is
something off about this new book, something vague and ungraspable
about its themes, beyond the requirements of serious scholarship.
Much of it, despite Kammen's frequent reminders about how
``complex'' things are, seems rather familiar.
</P>
<P>
   There is a great deal of rather solemn throat clearing in this
book, as if Kammen himself hesitated to get to the point. He so
laboriously cites what prior writers have said on his subjects that
whole chapters seem more compilations of researched tidbits than
fully developed arguments of his own.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Kammen's writing elsewhere has been praised for
its elegance, here it has a wordy, repetitive, glutinous quality
that makes it difficult to get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a fairly broad consensus, encompassing
people with otherwise divergent perspectives, that ever since
mid-century, and especially since the dominant role of television
became evident around 1960, cultural stratification and the
existence of distinct brow levels have become blurred where they
haven't been overtly blended,'' Kammen writes in a typically
cumbersome sentence. Ask yourself as you read it exactly what has
been ``blurred'' or ``overtly blended.'' You can guess what Kammen
means here, but it isn't what he has said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kammen treats culture in the broad sense as referring to all the
elements that go into a way of life: habits, customs and behavior
as well as art, music and literature. Culture is baseball as well
as Beethoven, the way you shop and the books you read. As he treats
this vast subject, he is at his best when he departs from concept
and delves into concrete example.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with an assertion that popular culture is not at all
the same thing as mass culture, and that ``definitional clarity''
(another fancy locution; ``clear definitions'' would be simpler and
more accurate) is essential. It is about 50 pages later that the
differences between these two categories begin to emerge, but when
they do, Kammen provides a bracing shock of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis here has to do with the elements that made up
American popular culture from about 1880 to 1940, when it was the
centerpiece of American culture in general. Kammen talks about the
Sears, Roebuck catalog, self-help books, minstrel shows, newspaper
comic strips and the emergence of supermarkets as artifacts of what
he calls proto mass culture, or ``PMC.'' Later he provides some
illustrative elements of ``MC,'' mass culture itself: not Sears but
McDonald's, not syndicated comic strips but MTV, not urban parks at
the end of trolley lines but Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, one of the most basic differences between popular
and mass culture hinges upon the more participatory and interactive
qualities of the former in contrast to the more spectatorial and
passive qualities of the latter,'' he writes. The supposedly active
popular culture versus the passive mass culture (in fact, later in
the book Kammen cites opinions that the most recent artifacts of
mass culture, like computer games, are not passive at all) is not
the only difference.
</P>
<P>
   He also cites the transformation from what he calls a
commercialized culture to a commodified one. In one, he writes,
companies find new ways to market goods that people actually need.
In the other, companies use advertising to create the need.
</P>
<P>
   The reader will find in these pages brief histories of cultural
criticism, of the growth of corporate power in creating the mass
culture and the near destruction of the boundaries between the
middlebrow culture and the highbrow one. There are also compelling
passages that trace the decline of traditional cultural authority,
a decline hastened by corporate power: ``The entrepreneurial power
of commerce totally crushed the recommendations of such cultural
authorities as John Crosby, Jack Gould and Gilbert Seldes _
prominent television critics who pleaded for diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not exactly new points, but they are elements in a
compelling and even thrilling American story: of the brilliant,
beleaguered popular culture and its partial eclipse by the rise of
the mass culture. Kammen tells that story topic by topic rather
than time period by time period, perhaps not the right approach.
</P>
<P>
   His presentation thereby loses narrative force and results in a
confusing overlapping of subjects and illustrations. Paradoxically,
this author's encyclopedic knowledge of his subject gets in the way
of the story he had to tell. Kammen seems compelled to put
everything in, when a more fully developed less might have been
more.
</P>
<P>
   What Kammen has done, in short, is reflect on the popular and
mass American cultures from a highbrow academic standpoint, but
highbrow in an unnecessarily eggheadish, inaccessible way. There is
marvelous information and interpretation here for those who have
the patience to dig it out, but patience will surely be needed.

   The time has come to give coconut milk a permanent place in your
pantry. One of the keys to the flavors of Southeast Asia, India and
much of the Caribbean, this no-frills liquid could hardly be easier
to use: just open and pour. Like canned tomatoes, it is the
foundation of some essential dishes. Like canned chicken stock, it
can turn a dry dish into a pleasantly saucy one in about two
minutes. Like both, its usefulness and versatility transcend the
stigma of canned food.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut milk is not the anemic fluid found inside a coconut;
that's coconut juice, which is drunk as if it were water in the
tropics. And it's not the thick and heavily sweetened mass also
sold in cans that is used to make pina coladas and other drinks;
that's cream of coconut, which is coconut milk laced with loads of
sugar. Instead, it is the essence of coconut meat made liquid, with
all of the flavor and none of the grittiness.
</P>
<P>
   Although coconut milk may be a new ingredient to many Americans,
it is common in everyday cooking throughout the tropics, in both
sweet and savory preparations. It is, for instance, a fast dessert
sauce in Vietnam and the basis for the Puerto Rican coconut pudding
called tembleque. It is also used in many Caribbean rice and bean
dishes and soups, as a luxurious finish in stews in parts of India
and as a major ingredient in many Thai soups and curries. In South
America, it is used like (or with) broth in lobster and chicken
stews.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut milk is also the backbone of dozens of ``creamy'' meat
dishes in countries where refrigeration is uncommon or where dairy
products are shunned for practical, traditional or religious
reasons. (It is not a dieter's substitute, though: coconut milk is
just as high in saturated fat and calories as coconut and coconut
oil. If this concerns you and you want to cut back on calories and
fat, just cut the coconut milk with water or chicken stock; the
flavor is so strong that it will still come through.)
</P>
<P>
   But coconut milk does more than add distinctive flavor. It acts
as a thickener as well. Stirred into simmering dishes in the last
few minutes of cooking, it has much the same effect as heavy cream,
as in the curry recipe here. Used as a substitute for water to cook
rice or rice pudding, it turns the ordinary into the sublime. It
has the same effect when fresh corn kernels are simmered in it. It
can even be used as wine or brandy is to deglaze a skillet, or to
finish cooking noodles; both of these techniques are used in the
stir-fried noodle recipe here.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, coconut milk needs only sugar to make one of the
world's greatest sorbets. Just thoroughly mix two cans (three to
four cups) with three-quarters of a cup of sugar (or more to
taste), plus a teaspoon of vanilla, and freeze in an ice cream
maker. This sorbet is best served the day it's made.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any supermarket carries coconut milk these days, in
either the Asian or the Hispanic section, but you can make your own
quite easily. Start with dried, unsweetened coconut flakes, sold in
bulk in natural-food stores. Place a couple of cups of coconut in a
blender with an equal amount of boiling water, and blend. (Do this
very carefully, since few things are worse than airborne boiling
water.) Let the mixture sit for a few minutes, then strain through
a sieve, pressing down to extract as much liquid as possible, and
you have coconut milk.
</P>
<P>
   You can make it thicker or thinner by varying the proportions.
(You can also start with a fresh coconut, but that is much more
complicated, since the coconut has to be roasted, shelled and
grated. The process is not much fun.)
</P>
<P>
   Twelve- to 18-ounce cans of coconut milk, usually from Southeast
Asia, are always cheap, about $1.50 each and sometimes less. Some
milks are thicker than others _ so thick that you may have to add
water to work with them _ and it's worth trying to find one of
those brands and sticking with it. Thicker is better because you
can thin the milk, which means you get more for your money. Often
the liquid will have a thick, almost clotted top, but it can just
be shaken to emulsify it.
</P>
<P>
   Most cans contain a single preservative, potassium
metabisulfite, which is generally considered harmless except for
those with sulfite allergies, especially asthmatics. Other than
that, the label should list no ingredients other than coconut and
water.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut milk is perishable. Once a can has been opened, it
should be refrigerated immediately and used within two days, or it
can be frozen indefinitely. In the cabinet, it's as shelf-stable as
tomatoes or broth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COCONUT RICE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 cans unsweetened coconut milk, 3 to 4 cups
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups rice, preferably jasmine
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine coconut milk and rice in a saucepan, and bring to a
boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add some salt, reduce
heat to low, and cover. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally
to make sure the rice does not stick or burn.
</P>
<P>
   2. Uncover, and continue to cook, stirring, over low heat until
rice is tender and mixture is creamy. If liquid evaporates before
rice is done, stir in water, about { cup at a time, and cook until
done.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: For coconut rice and beans: Stir 1 cup of moist
cooked kidney, pinto, pink or black beans into the rice about 5
minutes before it finishes cooking.
</P>
<P>
   For rice pudding: reduce rice to 1 cup; add } to 1 cup sugar.
(Start with the smaller amount.) Cook as above, leaving the mixture
very creamy. Serve warm or cold, with a little more coconut milk
stirred in; garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon.

<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   } pound linguine-style rice noodles, or Italian linguine
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons canola, corn or other neutral oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound minced or ground boneless pork or chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow or red bell pepper, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 eggplant, about { pound, cut into {-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 can (1{ to 2 cups) unsweetened coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   Nam pla (fish sauce), soy sauce or salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Minced cilantro for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. If using rice noodles, soak them in very hot water to cover
until ready to add to stir-fry in Step 4. If using linguine, bring
a large pot of water to a boil, salt it, and cook pasta until it is
nearly but not quite done. Drain, and rinse in cold water.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet
or wok; turn heat to high. A minute later, add meat, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove with
slotted spoon; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add another tablespoon of the oil to skillet, followed by
bell pepper and eggplant. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring
occasionally, until both are browned and tender, about 10 minutes.
Remove with slotted spoon; combine with meat.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add remaining tablespoon of oil, followed immediately by the
garlic and about 30 seconds later, the coconut milk. Cook over
medium-high heat, stirring and scraping with a wooden spoon, for
about a minute. Add drained noodles along with meat and vegetables,
and cook until noodles absorb most of the coconut milk, about 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Season with nam pla to taste, then add plenty of black
pepper. Garnish with cilantro, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   &UR; SHRIMP OR CHICKEN CURRY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola, corn or other neutral oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 can unsweetened coconut milk (1{ to 2 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds peeled shrimp or boneless chicken, cut into }- to
1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peeled, seeded and diced tomato (canned is fine; cut up
and drain before using)
</P>
<P>
   Chopped basil or mint for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place oil in a large skillet; turn heat to medium-high. A
minute later, add onions, along with a generous pinch of salt and
some pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very
soft and almost falling apart, 15 minutes or more. Stir in curry
powder, and cook, stirring, for another minute or so.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add coconut milk, and cook until it thickens, about 2
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add shrimp or chicken, and stir,
then cook until done, 3 to 6 minutes. (Shrimp cooks a little faster
than chicken; if you are in doubt about whether chicken is done,
cut into a piece.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Add tomato, and cook another minute; adjust seasonings as
necessary. Serve over rice, garnished with basil or mint.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; As Fast as Your Can Opener &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Combine canned coconut milk with canned Thai curry paste, and
you have the equivalent of Campbell's soup for the '90s: the sauce
that launched a thousand dishes. Add about a pound of cubed duck,
turkey or firm fish, lump crab meat, beef strips or whole shrimp to
a can of the milk, along with a couple of tablespoons or more of
the curry paste. Simmer, and serve over rice for a main course for
four.
</P>
<P>
   Simply mixed with equal parts coconut milk and broth, a canful
also makes a soup almost faster than Campbell's. The paste comes in
green or red versions, both hot from the chilies used to make them
and both good with anything from fish to potatoes. Four-ounce cans
sell for $1 or less at Asian markets.

   Every bartender, busboy, hostess or waiter has a collection of
horror stories from the front lines. Behind ``the customer is
always right'' and ``service with a smile'' lurks backlash of epic
proportion beyond the swinging doors.
</P>
<P>
   Just what does your waiter think of you? A handful of Web sites
catering to members of the service industry offer a hint,
cataloguing their peeves and posting information, anecdotes, advice
and the tipping habits of the rich and famously cheap. Some sites
are essentially cyber support groups; others offer advice for the
customer as well as the help. In either case, be forewarned: all of
them include language that isn't appropriate for the dinner table.

   If you're interested in celebrities and what they tip, the
Stained Apron (wso.net/apron) is the spot. According to postings on
the site, Kevin Costner, Johnny Depp and Bernadette Peters are
stellar tippers (20 to 50 percent), while Dan Quayle and Ice-T are
less generous (the rapper is said to have tipped less than 10
percent at a Sizzler).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the site is dedicated to venting, like the rant from the
waiter who had to pick through the trash to find a child's
retainer. Other sections include Why Tipping Properly Is So
Important (Bad Things May Happen) and Menu Manglings, which are
tales of customer confusion during ordering (a car-ah-fay of
shab-liss, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   The Waiter's Revenge (www.geocities.com/soho/1227) is an
extensive site organized like a menu with entrees including Stories
From Under the Table, yarns about customers like the man who
ordered fish baked in parchment, then ate the paper and complained
that the fish was tough and crunchy. There is also Your Dream
Revenge on Bad Tippers, a section for waiters' anxiety dreams, and
a selection of waiters' haiku: Flies found in my soup, Guarantee a
free dessert, Top with a cherry.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterwaitress (bitterwaitress.com) is a newer site along the
same lines. A large part of it is still under construction, and
there are plans to include gossip and rantings about restaurant
owners, which none of the other sites do. There are departments
like Celebrity Gossip and Industry Dirt. A glossary includes terms
like Discover Card, defined as a sure sign that a person is cheap,
a bad tipper and out of his league. The only celebrity tidbit is
from a server at Ocean Grill on New York's Upper West Side, who
reports Pierce Brosnan left 10 percent and a dollar for the coat
check.
</P>
<P>
   The Hostess Gripe Page (www.geocities.com/napavalley/8691) is a
spinoff of the Waitress Gripe Page, which is no longer up and
running. It opens with: ``This Web page was solely created to
enlighten people about what a hostess in a restaurant actually does
and what she has to go through.'' This consists of anecdotes under
the heading Hall of Stupid Customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Disgruntled Ex-Burger King Employees page
(www.geocities.com/capitolhill/lobby/2645) caters to an apparent
legion of former Burger King employees seeking solace. The site's
manifesto begins: ``My pain runs deep. My acne has never left my
face.'' It is large, somewhat frightening and has a message board
and mailing list, with sections like the Evil Customer. &QL;

   The very thought of preparing dim sum from scratch stops most
home cooks before they start. All that painstaking slicing,
chopping, wrapping, steaming and frying, just to produce six or
eight of these assorted Chinese dumplings and other tidbits, often
served for brunch, usually leads to one thing: opting to let a
restaurant cook these tasty morsels for you.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dim Sum: The Essential Kitchen'' by Vicki Liley (Periplus
Editions, $17.95) changed my mind. Once the marketing was done,
including a side trip to an Asian grocery for wonton, I was able to
whip up six dishes in about an hour. The payoff? An impressive and
delicious array of hot appetizers for four people.
</P>
<P>
   It did take planning, though. A pork fillet had to marinate
overnight in hoisin, garlic, five-spice powder, soy sauce and
sugar. It went into the oven first, and in the half-hour it took to
roast, I made a spinach stuffing for dumplings, assembled an oyster
sauce for blanched bok choy and simmered a black bean sauce for
steamed clams. When the pork was done, I tossed shiitake mushroom
caps in a soy and sesame marinade and broiled them. Then, I
stir-fried squid with garlic and chilies, and steamed the
dumplings. None of these tasks required a cooking school education,
just the ability to watch two pots at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The spinach and ginger dumplings were a breeze, with four
quickly stir-fried ingredients going into wonton wrappers sealed
with a quick twist at the top, without elaborate pleating. But the
instructions should have specified putting the spinach mixture in a
strainer first to drain off excess liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Liley's recipes, like deep-fried stuffed crab claws,
sauteed shrimp pancake rolls, and steamed lotus leaves filled with
sticky rice, chicken, shrimp, sausage and seasonings, present a
daunting list of ingredients and demand an afternoon's
concentration. Others, like salmon beggar's purses, are more
creative than what you may find on the carts in a dim sum palace.
</P>
<P>
   The book gives advice on serving dim sum and tea _ never serve
sugar and milk with the tea _ and on what place settings are best
with what dishes. Beautiful photographs accompany each recipe,
though the ones for shrimp balls and clams in black bean sauce were
reversed. But unfortunately the names of most of the dishes are
given only in English, not in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   You get much more help with Chinese names and pronunciations in
``Have Some Dim Sum'' by Evelyn Chau (Hushion House, $19.95). While
Ms. Liley's book is definitely for the home cook, this book is
meant for restaurant-goers. It provides the name of each dish in
Chinese _ with a guide to pronunciation _ and in English, and gives
a good description of each one, but has fewer photographs. It is
clearly organized, grouping steamed, fried and sweet dim sum
dishes, with a small section of specialties like tripe and congee,
a hot rice porridge.
</P>
<P>
   The history of dim sum, which is thought to date from the Tang
dynasty (A.D. 618 to 906), is explained, along with how the various
dishes are served, when to use dipping sauces and what you have to
know about the tea-drinking protocols. (Tipping the lid of the tea
pot alerts the server to refill it.)
</P>
<P>
   Recipes, many of which rely on chicken bouillon powder, a
shortcut ingredient, are included for only about a third of the
dishes. In general, the recipes here are not as appealing as those
in Ms. Liley's book. The steamed spare ribs in black bean sauce,
one of very few dishes that were in both books, were a bit gummy
and not as well seasoned as the ribs made according to the recipe
in ``Dim Sum: The Essential Kitchen.''

   OAKVILLE, Calif. _ Route 29 is the Yellow Brick Road of
California wine. Between the city of Napa and the town of
Calistoga, about 20 miles to the north, 29 is a dazzling display of
some of the most beautiful and prosperous wineries in the world.
From May to October, the road is packed with tourists who have come
to gape at these temples of the good life, with their manicured
vineyards and welcoming tasting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly any of the tourists bother to glance at the Napa Wine
Co. here as they drive by. It's not hard to understand why.
Compared with the sleek Opus One and Robert Mondavi wineries just
to the north, the Napa Wine Co. looks like a truck terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, many of the most sought-after cult wines _ the
wonderful, little-known labels sold through exclusive mailing lists
_ are made right here behind these unprepossessing walls.
</P>
<P>
   Pahlmeyer Vineyards, the Lamborn Family Wine Co., Fife
Vineyards, La Sirena, the Staglin Family Vineyard, Larkmead
Vineyards, Mason Cellars, the Bryant Family Winery, Anthology,
Azalea Springs, Buehler Vineyards, Broman and Stone Creek are a few
of the 50 or so wines made in this industrial-looking space. Larger
wineries like Domaine Chandon, Benziger and Mumm Napa Valley also
use the Napa Wine Co. from time to time for part of their
winemaking chores.
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Wine Co. is what is known in the trade as a
custom-crush operation. ``Custom crush'' means making wine in
someone else's winery. For a small winemaker, the economic benefits
of this are obvious. The capital investment in winemaking equipment
_ crushers, fermenters, bottling lines _ is considerable: hundreds
of thousands of dollars, whether the goal is to make 100 cases or
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee, the Napa Wine Co. can handle the entire winemaking
process from the time the grapes arrive at the winery door until,
two or three years later, the bottled, aged, labeled and packaged
wine heads off to customers or wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an unusually cool summer, the 1999 harvest is about
three weeks late, but the technicians at Napa Wine are busy
scheduling the arrival of grapes for dozens of growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we ask is 24 hours' notice,'' said Robert Lawson, Napa
Wine's general manager. ``Traffic can get heavy when the grapes
start coming in, and the growers tend to get nervous. We tell them
to be patient; that everyone will be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Napa Wine has three winemakers, including Lawson, plus several
dozen assistants, but each client must have its own consulting
winemaker. The consulting winemakers, who over the years have
included such stars as Tony Soter, Heidi Barrett, Helen Turley and
Cathy Corison, may take over most of the winemaking tasks or merely
direct them. They also return regularly to check on their wines as
they mature in barrels.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Napa Wine employees said, their relations
with the consulting winemakers are good but some can be arrogant
and, they say, unreasonable. ``Most of them hope one day to get
their own wineries,'' said one Napa Wine staff member. ``Some,
we're glad when they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Wine staff, most of whom have been working in Napa
Valley wineries all their lives, plot their winemaking schedule
with military precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what varieties will mature first and in what parts of
the region,'' Lawson said. ``Sauvignon blanc comes in first, then
Napa chardonnay, then up-valley zinfandel. Pinot noir should be
next, then Sonoma chardonnay, followed by Carneros chardonnay and
Sonoma Coast pinot noir. Finally, we get cabernet sauvignon, merlot
and cabernet franc.''
</P>
<P>
   By federal law, wine for commercial use must be made in a bonded
_ that is, licensed _ winery, and each of the small wineries that
use the place have their own bond number assigned by the federal
government. At harvest time, many wineries can be making wine at
the same time in a 24-hour-a day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When one of them is making wine in the plant, workers paint a
yellow line on the floor and that becomes that particular winery's
bonded quarters for as long as the job takes, even if it's only for
an hour or two. When the wine is moved into barrels for aging, the
storage area then becomes the bonded premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very popular way to make wine,'' said Stephanie
Grubbs, Napa Wine's sales and marketing director. ``We usually have
a waiting list of 10 to 15 prospective clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is owned by the Pelissa family, farmers and grape
growers in the Napa Valley for four generations. The present winery
was built in 1870 and had been owned by Heublein &AMP; Co., which used
it to make chardonnay for its Inglenook brand. The Pelissas, who
own some 650 acres of grapes in the Napa Valley, bought it in 1993
and turned it into a custom-crush business.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, catching on to a trend of their own making,
the Pelissas began to market their own wines under the Napa Wine
Co. label, a 1997 sauvignon blanc and '97 pinot blanc, and a 1996
cabernet sauvignon. With an eye on making top-quality wine, they
are now competing with their own customers.

   CHINA-SECT (Shanghai) _ Chinese authorities announced on Tuesday
that they are preparing to prosecute top leaders of Falun Gong, a
signal that China has reached the final stage of its broadest
political mobilization campaign in a decade. Falun Gong, a
spiritual movement of more than 20 million members that badly
spooked China's leaders with its ability to organize potent
anti-government protests, was banned last month as the Communist

   CONGO-ACCORD (Nairobi, Kenya) _ The peace process in Congo took
a major step forward on Tuesday when two rival rebel factions
agreed to sign a cease-fire document already approved by other
combatants in the yearlong civil war. But like almost everything
else about the war, the compromise between the two groups is
decidedly complex. Rather than have two or three rebel leaders sign
the peace document, as originally envisioned, the compromise calls

`CHICAGO HOPE': FALTERING DRAMA, HEAL THYSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the producers of the loopy comedy ``South
Park'' were to make a medical drama, it might go something like
this:
</P>
<P>
   An attractive female surgeon, heading to work on her first day
at a major hospital, cheerfully asks a woman on the street for
directions but is warned: ``Oh, I wouldn't go there. They'll kill
you there!'' Then the hospital's new president jogs into a staff
meeting and, in a scene that takes precisely 25 seconds, fires most
of the doctors. When they go to court to get their jobs back, the
judge angrily instructs their lawyer to tell his clients he's a
toad, then corrects himself, ``a big toad.'' Oh, and the nine-hour
operation to remove an inoperable brain tumor from a 9-week-old
baby is a success.
</P>
<P>
   This is not ``South Park.'' It is ``Chicago Hope,'' or rather,
the new ``Chicago Hope.'' That was the plot line of the last
episode of the spring, and it was, to put it mildly, a harbinger of
changes to come in the direction of a fairly traditional and slowly
dying one-hour drama that CBS is attempting to resurrect from last
year's ratings slump. It is a highly unusual gamble, not unlike
operating on an inoperable tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time television series are tinkered with all the time.
This fall, for instance, the British comic Eric Idle, a ``Monty
Python'' alumnus, is joining the cast of ``Suddenly Susan,''
Heather Locklear is coming to ``Spin City,'' and ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place'' is being renamed ``Two Guys'' and moved out of
its pizza parlor.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at CBS and the 20th-Century Fox studio, which
produces ``Chicago Hope,'' said that to the best of their
recollection no major prime-time drama had been reinvented so
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope'' is, in effect, being hit with a triple heart
bypass, electroshock therapy, multiple organ transplants and a
fashion makeover, in the form of new producers, a new writing
staff, the replacement of nearly half the cast _ among the incoming
actors are Barbara Hershey, Mandy Patinkin (who was on the show in
its first couple of seasons), Carla Gugino and Lauren Holly _ and a
new time slot, not to mention new opening titles and new theme
music.
</P>
<P>
   These are desperate times in network television; audiences and
profits have been dwindling rapidly. And the show's radical
overhaul reflects the depth of the anxieties rippling through the
industry. None of the major networks, CBS included, have produced a
hit one-hour drama recently. (The most Emmy nominations for a drama
this year were for ``The Sopranos,'' which is on HBO, a cable
channel.) But in CBS' view ``Chicago Hope'' has a few strong points
that make the experiment worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the show's audience has tumbled from a peak of an
11.9 rating and a 20 share in 1995-96 to a 7.5 rating and 13 share
last season, according to Nielsen Media Research. (Each rating
point represented 994,000 homes last season; share is the
percentage of homes watching television tuned to that show.) But
``Chicago Hope'' has been on the air since the fall of 1994, and it
is already being rerun on the Lifetime channel. Thus there is high
name recognition and at least a modest base of viewer interest to
build on, rather than starting from scratch in a glutted market in
which new shows have been doing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, ``Chicago Hope'' has a star who is
assuming a more active role: no, not one of the doctors in scrubs,
but the show's creator, David E. Kelley, who is the hottest writer
and producer in television. After Kelley started ``Chicago Hope''
in 1994 he moved on, as is common, and created his current
successes, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' This fall he has
two new shows, an edited-down half-hour version of the one-hour
``Ally,'' and a show about private detectives, ``Snoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing signs that ``Chicago Hope'' was headed toward
cancellation, Kelley approached people at CBS early last spring and
said he would become a hands-on producer again if they would give
the show another chance. The network was initially lukewarm but
finally agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation reflected another reality of network television:
producers can earn much more money creating new shows than sticking
with old ones. As an executive producer, a veteran can earn $1
million or so a year, but a producer who creates a new show that
catches on can earn tens of millions of dollars, not to mention a
multimillion-dollar deal with a studio to create more shows.
</P>
<P>
   The two executive producers who had run ``Chicago Hope'' for
several seasons, John Tinker and Bill D'Elia, said they had begun
to pull back from day-to-day involvement in the series last season
because they wanted to concentrate on developing new shows. They
said they were not unhappy about being replaced as executive
producers this year, because it allowed them to put all their
efforts into the three ideas they were pitching the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show needed some major changes, and we realized we weren't
the guys to do that again,'' said D'Elia. ``We had our development
deal, and that was what John and I wanted to focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley made the changes as he swept back in from the other shows
he had developed. He wrote the jolting season-ending episode as
well as a rather unconventional opening episode for this fall in
which a Roman Catholic priest's sex organ is bitten off during a
robbery then surgically reattached, and an elderly man dies in the
recovery room after liposuction while his surgeon trades stocks on
the Internet. Naturally the doctors also perform a near-miracle in
saving a boy on the operating table whose damaged heart is spewing
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``By design I wanted to send a wake-up call that the show will
be very different,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not planning to produce more scripts himself, he added,
but will supervise the writing and offer suggestions on future
scripts, giving ``Chicago Hope'' his continuing creative
imprimatur, a major incentive for the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the most important thing is his involvement,'' Leslie
Moonves, the president of CBS Television, said of Kelley's new
role. ``I'm aware he has a lot on his plate. But it's a little bit
of a promotional thing. If a talent like David Kelley comes in and
pitches you a hospital show, how do you say no?''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th-Century Fox Television, put
it more directly: ``If David Kelley were not in the mix and had not
pledged to do what he said he would do, this wouldn't have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, CBS has very modest expectations for the show. Moonves
made it clear that he was hoping for, at best, a slight jump in the
show's share of the market. In other words, the networks, with the
sharp declines in their share of the viewing audience, rarely
expect the kind of 20- and 30-share hits that used to be common.
They are now delighted with what in football terms would be called
``three yards and a cloud of dust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for a turnaround,'' Moonves said. ``We
specifically put it in a place where a 14 share will be good, very
good. Our expectations are not big. With a point or two increase in
share, we look great.'' He added, ``It's a new era.''

<P>
   The show is also going against a powerful trend of vying for a
young audience, generally the 18-to-34-year-old age group. None of
the changes this season are expected to focus on that fickle
audience, and the show's new time slot _ Thursday nights at 9,
starting on Sept. 23 _ puts it opposite NBC's blockbuster evening
of sitcoms, which attract young, largely male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our mandate is to attract more older viewers,'' said
Henry Bromell, one of the new executive producers for ``Chicago
Hope'' and the head of its writing team.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been star-crossed from its first broadcast, on
Sept. 18, 1994. It was scheduled that fall on Thursday nights
opposite another medical show, NBC's ``E.R.'' That was unfortunate
because ``E.R.'' went on to become one of the most celebrated and
successful dramas on television, leaving ``Chicago Hope'' deep in
its shadow.
</P>
<P>
   It then began a hapless peregrination around the CBS schedule.
At one point it found what seemed a solid home on Monday nights but
was bumped for a new drama, ``Brooklyn South,'' in 1997. When that
show failed, another new drama, ``L.A. Doctors,'' took the Monday
slot, leaving ``Chicago Hope'' on Wednesdays with no strong show in
front of it to bring in an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the show's plot lines began to drift in odd
directions. ``Chicago Hope'' had been conceived as a story of a
hospital: the last, best hope, in the words of Kelley. The focus
was intended to be the frontiers of medicine. But over the past
couple of seasons the doctors themselves and their tangled personal
lives took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kate Austin, played by Christine Lahti, wanted to become an
astronaut until she damaged her knee in an accident. Dr. Dennis
Hancock (Vondie Curtis-Hall) became a social activist and a
politician. Dr. Billy Kronk (Peter Berg) went to Africa to do
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost bordering on a soap opera,'' said Michael
Pressman, who directed the pilot episode in 1994 and has been
brought back as one of the executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those characters, and a few others, were summarily
let go in last spring's bloodletting, and Kelley said the show was
careering back essentially to what it had been originally. While
``Chicago Hope'' will still seek to create compelling characters
and stories, ``my focus is on the field of medicine,'' said Kelley.
``The hospital will be the biggest character on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromell said the doctors would rarely be seen out of their
scrubs. ``I want to see these characters only as they manifest
themselves at work,'' he said. ``The more you separate these
characters from the workplace, the less interesting they become,
not more.''
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin played the brilliant, abrasively egotistical Dr.
Jeffrey Geiger in the first several seasons before leaving to focus
on his family and singing career. Geiger is now the hospital's
president, the one who fired most of the old staff in last season's
closer, but Patinkin said he never would have considered coming
back were it not for Kelley's personal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to bring back the ensemble feeling to the
show,'' said Patinkin. ``Our old show got swept away. I feel like
we're getting back to where it was before that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remaining actors said they suffered from survivor's
guilt, as Adam Arkin, who plays the warmhearted Dr. Aaron Shutt,
put it. Hector Elizondo, who plays the hospital's chief of staff,
Dr. Phillip Watters, said he even considered quitting.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent afternoon the team was on the set, bantering
comfortably between shots and, Elizondo said, taking some comfort
in the fact that at least the crew was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a secure moment,'' said Pressman. ``It's a
complete unknown how this show will do.''

   Cutting the core out of a tomato is one of the more tedious
kitchen tasks, so I was intrigued by the claim made on the package
of the Tomato Core-It, which said the tool could ``bite'' the core
out. While this seemed a fairly vicious act to perform on the soft,
supple tomato, I had to give the Core-It a try.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Prince Castle Inc. in Carol Stream, Ill., the Tomato
Core-It looks a lot like a melon baller with teeth. It works
remarkably well, scooping out the core of a tomato in a single
circular motion. It can also hull strawberries and core halved
apples and pears.
</P>
<P>
   When you core a tomato with a paring knife, it is difficult to
cut in a smooth circle without the skin resisting the blade, and
often you cut too deeply into the flesh. The Core-It's short handle
makes it easy to control, allowing my hand to be very close to the
tomato. The teeth sawed right through the skin, and the ball shape
kept me from scooping too deeply. If biting is the way to describe
it, then the Core-It takes just a small mouthful.

 &HT;    Changing News Network: Kaplans take on CNN
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The view from Rick Kaplan's office, six stories above the CNN
Center atrium, is somewhat Godlike. From the window near his desk,
he can look down on the CNN newsroom (he spear-headed the redesign)
and the anchor desk (he booted some people out, elevated others).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's omnipresent,'' says morning anchor Daryn Kagan, one of
those who has flourished under Kaplan's reign. ``He's very
hands-on. It's not like some far-away executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, 52, has been president of CNN/US for two years, a tenure
that has seen the Operation Tailwind debacle, intensive coverage of
the Columbine High School shootings, the war in Yugoslavia and the
impeachment proceedings of President Clinton; the launch (and soon
the re-launch) of ``NewsStand''; and controversy, gossip and
sometimes division within the ranks of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's modification of CNN rolls on, with the biggest plans
still to come. On Sept. 13, the network will unveil a new version
of ``The World Today,'' a title it has already been using, as an 8
p.m. hourlong newscast it intends to be definitive. Larry King will
continue at 9 p.m. (the slot is essentially his as long as he wants
it), and then the revamped ``NewsStand'' will move back to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes for daytime hours, rolling out in September and
October, will turn the network more toward finanical and business
news, which Kaplan says have assumed a priority in viewers' minds
that the Cold War once had.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the changes Kaplan has wrought inside CNN _ the
corporate culture, the way it works _ have been more significant
than what appears on the air. Some longtime CNN veterans haven't
liked it; some acknowledge, grudgingly or enthusiastically, that he
has made the newsroom sharper. Executive producers have more power
(and pressure), anchors come in earlier and do more reporting, and
there's more centralized planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an organization that has conquered the world,'' says
Kaplan, an out-sized presence at 6-foot-7, ``and when you want to
change it, some people will get their back up and say `That's not
the way we do it.' I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I think I've gotten past the point where I need a
food-taster.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the concerns of CNN employees aren't necessarily
directed at Kaplan. The merger of CNN and Time Warner Inc., which
was finalized 10 months before Kaplan was hired, but which has had
fallout ever since, changed some of the ways CNN employees view
their workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Before, many CNN employees had the sense that they worked for
Ted Turner personally; one occasional refrain was that Turner ``may
be an s.o.b., but he's our s.o.b.'' Now, staffers who considered
themselves close to Turner note that he rarely just walks through
the newsroom any more to say hello. They feel as if they work for a
corporation headquartered in New York, which they do, rather than
one whose heart is in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan himself recognizes the issue, a combination of regional
pride and scrappiness; he refers to CNN as formerly being known as
``this Chicken Noodle Network down here in the South'' that ``beats
up regularly on those Yankees up North,'' meaning the network
competition. The irony is that Kaplan is a Yankee (a Chicago native
who worked for years in New York City) who came to CNN from ABC
News. The man who hired him, CNN News Group Chairman Tom Johnson,
is a Macon native and University of Georgia grad. In some ways,
Kaplan is a result of changes at CNN as much as he is the cause of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are being driven in large part by a need for stable
ratings, which means getting viewers to habitually tune in even
when there is no major news event. While other cable networks are
enjoying unprecedented ratings growth, CNN continues to be a
network of peaks (big news events) and valleys (the rest of the
time).
</P>
<P>
   Enormous graphs hang in hallways in the executive suites showing
CNN's ratings spikes for the Persian Gulf War, the O.J. Simpson
trial, etc., but those graphs don't hang in Kaplan's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually detest those graphs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fall is probably crucial, the major test,'' says Larry
Gerbrandt, a cable analyst for the media research firm Paul Kagan
and Associates. ``These are probably the biggest changes we've seen
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8 p.m. ``World Today,'' anchored by Wolf Blitzer (who's
first among equals), Joie Chen and Jim Moret will be what Kaplan is
calling ``our flagship program, the place where we expect CNN to
makes its statement about the news.'' The big guns are being
readied: Christiane Amanpour will appear, as often as possible,
from whatever international trouble spot she's in, and Jeff
Greenfield will offer analysis and finally find a home for his
tongue-in-cheek ``Looking Glass'' essays.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger change will be at 10 p.m., where ``NewsStand'' moves
to five nights a week. Instead of being anchored to a specific
magazine such as ``Fortune'' or ``Entertainment Weekly,'' the
newsmagazine will start off with breaking news and then run a mix
of magazine-style segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the news of the moment is going to take up the whole
hour of 'NewsStand,' and sometimes the news of the moment might
only take up the first couple of minutes,'' Kaplan says.
</P>
<P>
   The change was necessary because CNN was frequently having to
pre-empt ``NewsStand'' for breaking news, ranging from the war in
Yugoslavia to the death of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to look at Kaplan's first two years running
CNN/US is as a balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In his favor:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The news. Two years ago, most anchors were essentially
news-readers with little input; now they're more involved, and are
considered to be reporters (Kagan was first on the scene for CNN at
the Buckhead shootings in July, reporting via her cell phone).
Video footage was repeated frequently during the day; those repeats
have been cut back. When CNN isn't in what Kaplan calls ``rolling
coverage'' (such as the search for JFK Jr.'s plane), it usually
packs more news into 24 hours than it used to.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The newsroom. The $7.5 million re-built newsroom and anchor
set, unveiled last October, certainly gives CNN a much sleeker and
classier on-air look. It also alleviated the feeling journalists
had in the old newsroom of being ``15 pounds in a 10-pound bag,''
as Turner Properties project manager Chuck Burleson put it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jeff Greenfield. Kaplan, a former ABC News executive producer,
brought Greenfield from ABC to CNN, and both have benefitted.
Greenfield gets much more air time, and CNN has an analyst who is
thoughtful, fresh, and free of the easy, off-the-cuff soundbites
that are the life's blood of so many commentators on TV (including
CNN).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His temper. Or lack of it. At ABC, Kaplan was legendary for
being a rough taskmaster with a tendency to sometimes berate
others. He's still nobody's idea of a softie, but when the staff
gossips, it's not about Kaplan eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cash flow. CNN's cash flow (revenue minus certain costs, such
as interest) is climbing, according to analyst Gerbrandt. After
being flat in 1998 at $276 million, Gerbrandt says, CNN's cash flow
will rise this year to about $310 million and is projected to rise
in 2000 to about $363 million. ``If that's the scorecard for
Kaplan, he's definitely ahead,'' says Gerbrandt.
</P>
<P>
   And on the negative side of the Kaplan balance sheet:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Operation Tailwind. The blackest mark against CNN ever, this
story alleging U.S. soldiers used sarin nerve gas in Laos in 1970
led to a retraction, an apology and lawsuits for millions of
dollars that are still pending. Two producers were fired and one
executive resigned, but many staffers blamed Kaplan, because the
Tailwind story ran on the premiere of ``NewsStand,'' which he had
created and championed. At stormy meetings, CNN staffers vented
against Kaplan, and resentment still simmers among some that Kaplan
was never held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``NewsStand.'' Kaplan intended this newsmagazine to be
``appointment television,'' but it never has been. Although there
was some solid journalism, CNN kept having to pre-empt it. ``It's
my fault,'' Kaplan now says. ``I tell people unashamedly that I
learned a lot. When you have a news program that has to be
pre-empted for news, you have to sit back and say, 'There's
something wrong with the way we're set up here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Division in the newsroom. There is still a strong sense of
``ins'' and ``outs'' within CNN. Many long-time veterans are
particularly anti-Kaplan, and view him as someone who is too
ratings-oriented, who is making CNN too slick and packaged, too
much like ABC, CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nature of newsroom gossip has changed. Before Kaplan,
gossip tended to be personal: Who was in rehab, who was sleeping
with whom. Now it tends to be professional, sometimes with a
paranoid edge: Who's climbing the ladder, and who's fingers are
getting stepped on?
</P>
<P>
   CNN staffers in bureaus, such as New York, Los Angeles and
Washington, D.C., monitor the intense rumor level at CNN with some
bemusement. Greenfield, who's based in New York, allows that
journalists are perhaps worse gossips than some other professions,
but says he's seen it at other networks and in government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest on-again, off-again rumor at CNN has apparently
finally died. For a year after Operation Tailwind, Kaplan was
repeatedly rumored to be on the way out _ forced to resign or
fired. Then in June, Lou Dobbs _ longtime anchor, CNNfn president
and close friend of Ted Turner _ resigned suddenly after clashing
with Kaplan. Almost everyone inside CNN saw it as more than just a
victory for Kaplan _ that by vanquishing the well-connected Dobbs,
Kaplan's power base was more secure than anyone else's at the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I subscribe to Harry Chapin,'' Kaplan says, citing the '70s
singer-songwriter. ``It's the going, not the getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and CNN may still be going through some changes in the
future, but in terms of sealing his hold on the network's future,
he's gotten there.

 &HT;    `Too Deep': LL Cool J sings different tune as chilling druglord
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because an undercover cop secretly wears a badge, it
doesn't put him above the law. That's the crux of ``In Too Deep.''
If it doesn't bring anything new to the police-thriller genre, the
movie showcases sharp performances in its tale of an officer who
starts to identify a little too closely with his thuggish alter
ego.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Epps plays a detective known as Jeffrey Cole to his
colleagues, but as J. Reid on the Cincinnati streets where he poses
as a drug dealer fresh in from Akron. Little by little, Cole nears
his quarry, city crime lord Dwayne Gittens (LL Cool J), who goes by
the nickname God. That may be because Gittens has a knack for
controlling every aspect of his underlings' existence _ their
homes, their incomes, their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' shows how Cole wins Gittens' confidence,
ironically fabricating the sort of friendship that will put him
close enough to betray the mobster. We follow Cole as he's
initiated on the proving grounds of urban masculinity _ whether at
a neighborhood boxing ring or a bleak alley, where his loyalty is
tested with an order to shoot an enemy of Gittens.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucci plays Cole's commanding officer, Preston, who
understands the Jekyll/Hyde perils of undercover work, and urges
his subordinate to bury his own personal feelings behind the
made-up persona of J. Reid. As Cole puts it, ``What are you saying?
Act more?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Preston responds, ``care less.''
</P>
<P>
   While director Michael Rymer fills his movie with tense
confrontations in drug dens and a gruesome torture scene in a pool
hall, the movie hinges on the relationship between Epps and LL Cool
J's characters. Epps turns in a reliably vivid performance, but
it's the singer-turned-actor who's the revelation, presenting a
complete departure from his comic-relief role in ``Deep Blue Sea.''
He plays Gittens as the sort of fellow who makes sure every man and
child has a free meal on Thanksgiving, but doesn't hesitate to
brutalize the godfather of his own child at the first suspicion of
disloyalty. The actor offers us a monster whose charm makes him all
the scarier. He and Epps create a convincing, dangerous friendship
of such intensity you understand Cole's confusion when the time
comes to assert his genuine loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   The film's biggest disappointment is some wasted opportunities
for its actresses, trotting out Nia Long as Epps' partner in a
stale romantic subplot, and giving Pam Grier, as a surveillance
officer, too little to do. For the record, Atlanta music
producer/performer Jermaine Dupri has a small role as a fellow who
winds up in the bad graces of Gittens' gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps, LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R for strong sensuality and language and for some
violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next time you want to wow your dinner guests,
forget the Wedgwood, the sterling, the roses.
</P>
<P>
   Try a chandelier that's painted hot pink. A vine-shrouded arbor
that seats 10. A lush carpet of wheat grass. A gurgling fountain
for a centerpiece. Instead of candles, how about a fog generator to
create an air of mystery and romance? And the music? No need to
hire a musician _ just position a model in the center of the table
for live entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Sound far out? You bet. But those ideas are among the bag of
tricks used by 43 Atlanta designers who know how to send a table
over the top, especially when they're competing for the attention
of 600 dinner guests _ and especially when it's for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   The tables will be unveiled during Collection Rouge III: Dining
by Design, set for Monday at the Woodruff Arts Center to benefit
the Atlanta chapter of the nonprofit Design Industries Foundation
Fighting AIDS. Unlike other tabletop events, this one allows guests
to actually dine on the elaborate displays and mingle to check out
all the displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our favorite thing to do as far as charities go
because we get to be creative and do exactly what we want,''
interior designer Wendy Edwards said. ``It's so much fun to walk
around and see what everyone else has done, and that makes it not
stuffy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the creations by designers working in the
interiors, fashion, floral and hair industries will be two
tabletops by New York designers that are traveling to eight cities
where DIFFA chapters are sponsoring similar benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A new twist this year is 10 traveling champagne buckets
(Champagne Mumm is the national sponsor) that have been decorated
by or for national celebrities and will be raffled off at the end
of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Another 25 buckets will be filled with prizes by local artists,
designers and retailers and sold during a silent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsorships of tables as well as the $300 tickets to
the event, which sold out three months ago, benefit local AIDS
organizations. Last year, more than $150,000 was raised, said Carey
Carter, the 1999 chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For designers, the rules are simple: Their displays must fit a
72-inch round table, accommodate 10 guests and contain something
red, a color associated with the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a taste of what designers are planning:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Glorious gardens: The heat index may still be high, but guests
can enjoy the great outdoors inside the Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Long Flora Design is creating an intimate garden setting,
placed under an arbor in tribute to Madame Pompadour. ``Instead of
using a carpet, we're having a French carpet faux-painted on a
raised platform,'' Long said. Under the glasstop table, however,
the designer is ``planting'' wheat grass. And just for fun, Long's
attaching oversize pompadour wigs to the backs of the chairs.
``It'll look like you're sitting under a big hair dryer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary Events, caterers for the affair, is creating a garden
oasis amid the room's sea of red displays with an all-green table
placed in a vineyard setting. Strawberries will provide the dash of
red, designer Teresa Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing draws attention like the sound of water, and Atlanta
Water Gardens had guests gushing at last year's table with its
6-foot-tall copper fountain. This year, owner David Robinson plans
a modern encore, set in an Asian garden filled with tropicals and
with mist floating over the table.
</P>
<P>
   For a touch of whimsy, garden designer Brooks Garcia is up to
some monkey business under a tent filled with tropical fruits and
flowers and decorative monkeys dressed in red waistcoats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rooms totow: When table coordinator John Williams says
designers have gone over the top, he's not just talking about the
look of their displays. Many have requested ``vertical space'' for
creating entire rooms _ some under tents and canopies, others as
free-standing structures.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stewart has developed a 12-foot-high ``hot weather
pavilion'' with a beamed roof, columns and chandelier made of
branches, all painted hot pink.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zuber of Corporate Environments is moving his guests
into a living room set on a platform. ``We're passionately
recalling the 20th-century cocktail hour by camping it up with a
bar from the '50s and classic modern furniture such as Knoll,'' he
said. The room also will include television monitors showing
footage of '50s propaganda and films such as ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's.'' Guests are asked to dress as '50s stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saluting the centuries: Futuristic technology and time in
general are sure to factor heavily in this year's themes.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Miner secured permission to seat 12 at his table so that he
could create the face of a clock, with Roman numerals placed inside
each plate. A lamp, instead of flowers, will claim the centerpiece,
from which clock hands made of lightweight balsa wood will extend.
``It's kind of goofy but kind of different, too,'' Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Vantosh can identify. She and associate Patrick Delaney
have come up with a Y2K theme. Under each end of their table will
be metal restaurant-style shelves stocked ``with things you've been
hearing and reading you'll need during this outburst of fear
they're predicting _ flashlights, money, potatoes, powdered milk,
bottled water _ and, of course, plenty of champagne,'' Vantosh
said. ``We're really trying to keep it pretty simple.''
</P>
<P>
   At this event? Yeah, right.

 &HT;    A mystery crops up in `best garden ever'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Aug. 26.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like a fine professor for life, the garden never stops
teaching. Everlina R. Jackson grew one of the more surprising
lessons in her southwest Atlanta space.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, as in some 30 previous springs, Jackson planted
food, including pepper, corn, beans, cabbage, beets, squash,
cucumbers. And ``Irish'' potatoes. She bought the white eating
potatoes from the store, cut out the eyes and planted them _ one
per hill, or mound. ``I've done that before,'' she said recently,
referring to that pleasing practice of getting fresh vegetables or
fruits and finding ways to plant them.
</P>
<P>
   (I have enjoyed buying lemon grass from the farmers market and
putting the plant, bulb intact, in the ground _ where it grows
strap leaves lush and aromatic, recalling the incomparable taste of
a good Thai soup.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson planted the potato eyes in what she called her ``best
garden ever. One to remember.'' The potatoes ``bloomed so pretty,''
Jackson recalled. ``White blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, as she went out to dig up some of the potatoes,
``I saw those little things on them, looking like tomatoes, green
cherry tomatoes. I just couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange growth _ let's call it ``pomato'' _ puzzled
everybody, including friends, neighbors, her husband, Willie F.
Jackson, and her daughter, Notosha Wilson. During a visit to
Detroit, Jackson mentioned her surprising crop, and people there
were as amazed as Jackson was. As amazed as I was when I saw the
pictures and heard the description.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``Everybody I told about it said, `I didn't know
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   I got the same reaction _ until I told Wayne McLaurin, professor
of horticulture at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those aren't tomatoes,'' he said. ``They're seedpods.''
</P>
<P>
   Seedpods that go around fooling people into thinking they're
green tomatoes growing on potato vines are old fruit to McLaurin.
``I get a number of telephone calls about them every year,'' he
said, adding that, ``We have seen a number of these this year''
because the relatively cool spring was conducive to their growth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, when he was studying at Louisiana State
University, McLaurin became expert in the ways of potatoes, quickly
learning that the little round fruit tastes nothing like the
seductively sweet cherry tomato it imitates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a bitter taste to it,'' said McLaurin, explaining
that a poisonous alkaloid called solanine is concentrated in the
seedpods. Alas, yet another sweet surprise that turns out to be a
bitter disappointment. Eat enough of these pods, and you could get
sick, but, fortunately, the unpleasant taste would stop you _ if
you got past the green color.
</P>
<P>
   While the pods aren't edible, they are plantable. Cut them open,
and you'll find a lot of seeds, which can be sown in the early
spring. The resulting potatoes will be smaller, said McLaurin, but
beyond that there's no telling what you'll grow: ``You might get
whites and reds. Goodness only knows. It's like a Christmas
package.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be just fine with Jackson, who welcomed McLaurin's
analysis with calm interest. ``I had never seen it before, and I
had never heard of it,'' she said of the ``pomato,'' ``but if it
happens like that again, I'm going to plant those seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yet another lesson will grow in her garden.

 &HT;    Secrets to tackling a theme table
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Aug. 26.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the thought of developing a dinner party theme
seems as mind-boggling _ and expensive _ as buying your first home,
professional event planners have news for you: It doesn't have to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be different. Be daring,'' said Tony Conway of Legendary
Events, an Atlanta catering company.
</P>
<P>
   Once you allow your mind to reach beyond the predictable, beyond
the so-called rules of entertaining, you'll discover ideas that can
result in creative and inexpensive tabletops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to turn to yourself and see what you already have at
home,'' said David Tutera, a New York event designer who often
works in Atlanta. ``A lot of hosts have more than they think when
it comes to linens and fabrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Tutera and Conway, along with partner Teresa Day, are among
the designers creating tabletop displays for Monday's Collection
Rouge III: Dining by Design, a benefit for the Design Industries
Foundation Fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coming up with a theme, you need to think about it for a
few minutes, then step away from the idea and think of the most
unrelated things about it,'' Tutera said. ``Think of the least
obvious, go with the understated.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 tips shared by the pros:
</P>
<P>
   1. Clean up the garage: If you're looking for space for a large
dinner party and don't want to rent a hall, consider the garage.
``Clear it out and set up four or five tables with lots of
candles,'' Conway said. ``For any room that's boring, play up the
table and make it wow. Spend money on the table, not the decor.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Try unusual table sizes: Most homeowners have rectangular
tables. Conway suggests renting two 3-foot-by-6-foot tables and
placing them together to form a square, a shape more conducive to
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   3. Think beyond linens: Tablecloths are difficult to find for
large tables, so consider other coverings, such as inexpensive
12-inch-square ceramic tile placed over felt. Another option is to
cover a plywood tabletop with wallpaper or fabric, Day said.
</P>
<P>
   4. Edgy appeal: Instead of using table skirting, Day recommends
buying 54-inch-wide fabric that picks up the colors in the room and
attaching the fabric to the table's edge.
</P>
<P>
   5. Mix 'n' match fabrics: Don't be afraid to use more than one
fabric and pattern. Mix florals and checks that have common colors.
Old shawls and throws also can be used. Day crisscrosses linens to
add depth to a table and dresses up the corners by attaching
ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   6. Color wheels: Bring a balance to a riot of color on the table
by repeating one of the colors in the candles, napkins or plate
chargers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   7. Flower power: Flowers can be the table's greatest expense,
but they don't have to be. Homeowners often can collect cuttings
from their yard. ``Or you can go with a sleek look by using four or
five cylinder vases down the center of the table, all at one
height, and place one stem in each one,'' Tutera said.
</P>
<P>
   8. Lighting the way: Sometimes groups of candles can make a
centerpiece. Try small, inexpensive candles with lampshades, Day
suggests, or place an old lamp in the table's center.
</P>
<P>
   9. Collecting ideas: Use personal collections _ dolls,
figurines, old books _ to create a theme. If you don't have any,
raid the thrift stores and flea markets. ``Make a table eclectic by
using things that don't match,'' Tutera said. ``You can literally
buy 10 cheap place settings and make a table look like it was
designed that way.'' Glue pieces of inexpensive costume jewelry
onto napkin rings, which also make fun keepsakes for guests, Conway
said.
</P>
<P>
   10. Don't overdo it: Details make a theme and create
conversation. But while your imagination's running wild, don't
clutter a table. ``Maintain a few strong focal points,'' Day said,
``and stick to the theme.''

BERKELEY TEAM HAS NIGERIAN CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ There's already talk of a poster _ football
players in blue and gold posing under a banner reading: ``The
Nigerian Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably won't happen until these proud young men have
played in a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   This year's football team at the University of California at
Berkeley includes five new players _ four freshmen and one
sophomore transfer _ with deep roots in Nigeria. They join junior
starting cornerback Chidi Iwuoma in giving the Bears six
Nigerian-American players. Just two were born in Africa but all
were raised by Nigerian-born parents in a culture that values
education, family, religion and unity. Five are members of
Nigeria's Ibo ethnic group and one belongs to the Tiv ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The team runs from drill to drill at practice. Iwuoma will trot
over and say ``stay strong'' when he spots one of the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always told me that when you see another Ibo you
take care of them,'' Iwuoma said.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in speech, appearance or dress that sets the
Ibos or the lone Tiv, freshman running back Joe Igber of Honolulu,
apart from their teammates. They are typical young Americans,
distinguished by their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our family is, you always have to work really hard at
what you do,'' said freshman running back Joseph Echema of
Hawthorne, in Southern California. ``I try to live up to that
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen, to a man, were recruited by major football
programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman defensive tackle Daniel Nwangwu of Sugar Land, Texas,
chose UC-Berkeley over Colorado, Kansas, Baylor and Northwestern.
The decision delighted his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my dad being Nigerian, education is a very important
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Echema, his parents only wanted him to attend one of two
schools _ UC-Berkeley or Stanford University in Palo Alto _ because
of the academics.
</P>
<P>
   When freshman safety Nnamdi Asomugha of Harbor City, in Southern
California, began getting letters from football coaches, his mother
got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom values education so much that she sorted through the
mail,'' he said. She made two piles, schools with excellent
academic credentials and a second with all the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd throw in the football part,'' Asomugha said. ``She didn't
even look at football.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Asomugha has been through this before. An older brother,
Chijioke Asomugha, is a second-year cornerback at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Asomugha was considered a top prospect, a
blue-chipper, and his recruiting was followed across the country. A
sports Web site persuaded him to announce his decision over the
Internet, where he accepted UC-Berkeley's offer and turned down
Colorado, Michigan, Notre Dame and the University of Southern
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his mother's early involvement, Asomugha made the
decision alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She set the standard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nwangwu made the decision alone, with some strong guidelines
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to know the reasons why I did what I did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Bill Dutton remembers going to Texas to
recruit Nwangwu. He said the family met in the sitting area of his
hotel room, with the father sitting across from Dutton and four
children seated to his right in descending order of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask the recruit a question and he would look over at
his dad for acknowledgement. Only then would he speak,'' Dutton
said. ``I'm his dad now and he gives me that same total respect.
He's a beautiful kid to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said he wasn't concerned that Nwangwu might be too ``nice
and polite'' for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will he dig down and gut-bucket?'' Dutton said. ``Oh yeah,
darn right he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Igber and Echema were born in Nigeria. The others and the sixth
team member with Nigerian roots, senior starting defensive end
Mawuko Tugbenyoh, were born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Holmoe said the Nigerian connection occurred
``coincidentally'' and was not planned.
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledged that he was delighted with the strong
values the new players brought to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these guys there is a standard that is set,'' he said.

 SPALDEEN BRINGS BACK THE MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LOWELL COHN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This column is about a ball, the most special ball ever
invented. It's better than a baseball, basketball or a football.
It's better than any ball you can name. And although it's been gone
for 20 years, it's finally making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It is called a Spaldeen, which may not mean anything to you
unless you grew up on the East Coast, preferably New York, before
1979. I grew up in Brooklyn in the '50s and '60s, which means my
childhood memories are filled with Spaldeens.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some background. Starting in the 1920s, the Spalding Co.
manufactured tennis balls from its home base in Chicopee, Mass. But
there would be overruns, which means there wasn't enough of the
fuzzy stuff they attach to the outside of tennis balls. Some
anonymous genius _ and I use that word genius with reverence _ got
the bright idea to market the bright pink unused rubber cores as
the ``Spalding High-Bounce Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Because New York people don't talk so good, they pronounced
Spalding as Spaldeen _ ``Hey, Joey, you wanna play? I got a
Spaldeen.''
</P>
<P>
   Spalding would box the Spaldeens and ship them down to New York
where kids would buy them for a quarter apiece. And my God, when
you bought a brand new Spaldeen, the aroma alone would cause
ecstasy _ it was the smell of Bazooka bubble gum and summer and
childhood and joy and hope.
</P>
<P>
   And then you would go out and play. All those legendary New York
street games began and ended with Spaldeens. I'm talking about
games you've heard about but probably never played _ stickball,
punchball, stoopball, hit the penny and a million others. When it
came to inventing games with a Spaldeen, the only limit was your
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   You understand that we didn't have baseball fields or any other
kinds of fields. We played ball in playgrounds, really slabs of
concrete surrounded by a Cyclone fence, or we played in the street
using sewer covers as the bases.
</P>
<P>
   And the virtue of a Spaldeen, besides the fact that you could
whack it a mile, was it didn't break things. You hit Mrs. Samson's
Olds 88 with a Spaldeen, no big deal. No broken glass. No broken
mirror. No broken nothin'. Of course, Mrs. Samson would come
running down her steps screaming, ``I'm gonna tell your motha.''
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, I apologize, Mrs. Samson, wherever you
are.
</P>
<P>
   I mostly played in the park on the corner of Avenue L and East
18th Street. It was called the park but it never had a tree I ever
saw. And every kid would come to the park with a Spaldeen in his
back pocket. If someone had a stick, we'd play stickball. The stick
was an old broom handle or a dowel from the closet. We'd draw a box
on the wall and pitch to it, and if the batter hit it over the
fence it was a homer.
</P>
<P>
   We'd play handball with the Spaldeen, and sometimes we'd go to a
friend's house for stoopball. A kid would throw the ball at the
steps in front of someone's house, and as the ball sailed back
you'd try to catch it on a fly. If it bounced once it was a single,
twice a double, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But the king of Spaldeen games all over New York City was
punchball. You'd toss the ball over your head. You'd swing down
overhand as if you were serving a tennis ball. And then you'd punch
it with your closed fist. Guys could hit it 200 feet, long fly
balls that never came down. And there the puncher would be running
around the bases, actually painted squares on the park's grimy
concrete, while the outfielders ran like hell after the Spaldeen.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest punchball player I ever saw was Ronnie Salmonson,
who could punch the ball to Queens. At least it seemed he could. He
was a legend and now he's a dentist on Long Island, but he still
signs his e-mails, ``The punchball champion of Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spaldeen Era ended in 1979 when Spalding switched its
tennis-ball operation to Taiwan. An entire tradition wiped out just
like that. All those baby boomers forced to go cold turkey with
Spaldeen withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. The ball-playing public did not take this lying
down. It sent a constant flow of letters and e-mails to Spalding:
``Where can I get a Spaldeen? You're robbing me of my memories.''
</P>
<P>
   And get this, Spalding relented last January and began issuing
the Spaldeen as its own product, not as a byproduct of tennis
balls. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is so excited by this
development he's organized a stickball tournament throughout the
five boroughs, the finals to be played in front of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who's a cost-cutting guy, wanted to know how come a
Spaldeen now costs two bucks. ``Why isn't it still a quarter?'' he
asked Chris Waldeck of Spalding. To which Waldeck replied, ``Mr.
Mayor, why isn't the subway still a quarter?''
</P>
<P>
   Waldeck told me Spaldeens will be sold nationwide. In June, I
tried to buy one in Brooklyn. I took my son along and told him all
about Spaldeens while I lied about how far I could punch one. But
no store I went to had a Spaldeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're supposed to be reissuing Spaldeens,'' I said to one
shop owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I hoid about dat,'' he replied, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Waldeck assures me demand is outstripping production, but
Spalding will catch up soon. I hope so.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is said in the Middle East that a woman is not
ready to marry until she knows 1,000 ways to cook eggplant. That
may seem an unreasonable demand to American women, many of whom
marry before they know how to cook anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the saying is less about preparing women for marriage than
it is about the amazing versatility of the eggplant. In the eastern
Mediterranean, eggplant is a beloved staple. It replaces meat in
stews; it is sliced thin, grilled and drizzled with fruity olive
oil; it is charred, peeled and blended into a silky, garlicky
puree; it is layered with tomatoes, onions and oil, and baked until
it is creamy and caramelized. Eggplants are even cooked in sugar
syrup and eaten as a sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Such potential has not quite been realized in American kitchens.
And yet we now have more varieties than ever. Greenmarkets have
introduced us to long, slender purple eggplants; fat, round white
eggplants the size of grapefruit; plump, yellow wandlike eggplants,
and small green globes that look like uptight tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs use all of these regularly _ especially in August and
September, when eggplants are at the height of their season _ but
they rarely serve eggplant on its own. Instead, they prefer to keep
it a quiet, pivotal component to bring harmony to a dish.
</P>
<P>
   At Tabla, white, Asian and purple eggplants are incorporated
into a loosely defined ratatouille that lies between slices of lamb
and a black pepper mint sauce, absorbing some of the lamb juices
and softening the acidity of the sauce. In a green curry at Ubol's
Kitchen in Queens, Thai eggplants add a cooling element to a fiery
sauce. Smoky diced eggplants are mounded in the center of a plate
of tuna tartare at Palio. A tangy eggplant puree, flush with cumin,
is laid beneath grilled shrimp at Quilty's.
</P>
<P>
   The eggplant blends fluidly from one cuisine to another because
it is so idiosyncratic. It has a flavor all its own, a texture that
can range from meaty to creamy, and a gentle roundness that is
sensual. As useful as it may be, though, the eggplant, uncooked and
fresh from the vine, does much more to intimidate than to tempt.
</P>
<P>
   Eggplants are also unpredictable. One may be sweet, softening to
a luxurious pulp in the oven. Another may be dry and bitter, with
the texture of leather. That's why this fruit eaten as a vegetable
has challenged and charmed cooks for ages. But the challenge always
comes before the charm, which is why many people shy away from it.
It does not offer its riches unconditionally. You must work for
them.
</P>
<P>
   That work does not mean hours in the kitchen. It simply means
treating the eggplant with care, and responding to its quirks.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert, the author of ``Mediterranean Grains and Greens''
(HarperCollins, 1998), has the best advice: ``You have to start
with a good eggplant,'' she said. Like corn, eggplant that is old
is sorely disappointing. Unlike corn, bad eggplant can't really be
rescued. It will be bitter, pithy and, often, inedible.
</P>
<P>
   The many new varieties available, found at farmers' markets or
specialty markets, are usually dependably fresh because they tend
to be local. In the grocery store, it is more of a crap shoot. The
eggplants there are often oversize and old.
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant offers few clues to the buyer. It has almost no scent,
and bruises are often concealed. The best test for freshness is a
squeeze. The eggplant should be firm like a rubber ball. If it
gives like foam rubber, its flesh will be spongy and will soak up
more oil in the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   A good eggplant will also feel heavy for its size. Lift a few
and you will see the differences in weight. Once you buy one, use
it as soon as possible. If you leave it in the refrigerator for a
few days, it will soften and may become bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness, in fact, is the greatest mystery about eggplant. The
condition of the vegetable is the best indicator.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks like to argue over how to remove the bitterness as much as
chefs like to debate whether mayonnaise should be made in a blender
or by hand. The most common method is to salt it to draw out the
moisture, and thus the bitter juices. Simply cut or slice the
eggplant as you want it for cooking, and sprinkle the cut sides
with coarse salt, adding about as much salt as you would use to
season it. (Fine salt absorbs too quickly into the eggplant flesh.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, lay the pieces in a colander or shallow dish and place a
heavy object _ a plate or a saucepan _ on top, to weight them. I
usually let them sit for 30 minutes, less if the pieces are small.
While they sit, moisture is drawn out. After 30 minutes, a small
pool of water will have collected at the bottom of the dish.
Sometimes it is brown; these are the bitter juices. Rinse the
eggplant pieces with water, and pat them dry completely with a
towel.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is to brine them. In a bowl, mix water and salt
to the salinity of sea water _ one and a half tablespoons coarse
salt to one quart water _ then add the cut eggplant. Lay a bowl or
plate on top to keep it submerged, and let sit for 30 minutes.
Again, rinse the pieces and pat them dry before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The salt-water method works best with eggplant to be fried. The
brine adds moisture to the eggplant; when it hits the oil, the
water inside steams, preventing oil from entering the flesh and
giving the eggplant a puffy, softer texture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolfert, whose books on Mediterranean cooking are filled
with eggplant recipes, has another method. In a Spanish recipe for
fried eggplant in ``Mostly Mediterranean'' (Penguin, 1996), she
calls for salting the eggplant, then soaking it in milk. The milk
works like water, steaming and puffing the pieces as they fry, but
it also gives the flesh a noticeably creamier consistency, without
the taste of milk. It's a great trick, especially if the eggplant
is to be pureed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolfert has other tricks, too. To balance the bitterness _
even a good eggplant will have a trace of it _ she often sprinkles
on a little sugar before frying it or sometimes after cooking.
</P>
<P>
   As fussy as this vegetable can be, it does leave the cook some
latitude. It is better overcooked than undercooked. The longer it
cooks, the softer and more succulent it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Frying is perhaps the most common way to cook eggplant, and the
trickiest. There is nothing eggplant does better than soak up oil.
High heat is key. A nonstick skillet helps, too, because less oil
is needed. Heat the pan over high heat, add enough oil to thinly
coat the pan, then the eggplant, sauteing it just until it colors
on both sides. The idea is to cook the eggplant through before it
soaks up too much oil. (If you must add more oil, remove the
eggplant, add the oil and let it heat before replacing the
eggplant.)
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant fried without any coating soaks up the most oil. Using
flour is better, creating a wall between the oil and flesh. But
with a coating, you risk confounding the flavor of the eggplant. To
get an almost imperceptible layer of flour, make sure the eggplant
is dry, then dip it in the flour and toss the piece of eggplant
between your hands, shaking off as much excess as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs dust eggplant with all sorts of coatings _ cornmeal, Cream
of Wheat, Wondra, you name it. Wondra works especially well; it
creates a more solid layer than, say, cornmeal, and yet does not
clump like regular flour.
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant can also be fried in the oven. Jeanne Lemlin, the
author of ``Simple Vegetarian Pleasures'' (Harper Collins, 1999),
spreads slices of eggplant with a thin layer of mayonnaise and
coats them in fine bread crumbs before baking. The bread crumbs
create a kind of shell around the slices and the mayonnaise
provides the perfect amount of fat.
</P>
<P>
   The slices can also be tossed in a flavorful olive oil and
coated in bread crumbs or a mixture of bread crumbs and grated
Parmesan cheese before they are baked. You get a crispier coating
than flour and less oil in the eggplant, but the purity of the
flavor is compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Fried eggplant can be eaten as is, sprinkled with a great olive
oil and fresh herbs, or tossed with pasta. Many classic dishes,
like moussaka and gratins, call for frying slices of eggplant
before layering them with the other components.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer roasting eggplant, halved lengthwise or in slices. You
use less oil, and the oven heat tends to collapse the interior more
gently and caramelize the edges more deeply, underlining the
sweetness in eggplant. Some varieties, when roasted, turn almost
pudding-like in texture, one step away from a puree _ simply scoop
out the flesh and season it.
</P>
<P>
   Roast at a high temperature (400 degrees for half-inch-thick
slices and halves) to cook off as much moisture as possible, to
concentrate the eggplant's flavor and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant can also be charred, much like a pepper. Place the
whole eggplant directly over a gas flame or charcoal grill or under
the broiler, turning it slowly until the skin chars. This softens
the flesh and gives it a smoky flavor. Then, you can peel the
eggplant and drain the excess moisture _ and any bitter juices _
and puree it with anything from olive oil and salt to yogurt, cumin
and coriander, or tahini and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   At Molyvos, tomatoes, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and oregano
are stirred into the charred eggplant, and it is thinned and
lightened with seltzer water and eaten spread on flatbread.
</P>
<P>
   Eggplants come in a vast assortment of varieties beyond the
classic purple teardrop with tight waxy skin, especially with local
crops coming in at this time of year. Many have lyrical names like
Lilac Bride, Neon, Ghostbuster and Bambino that evoke their
differences in hue and size.
</P>
<P>
   There are fragrant white eggplants, and pale lavender ones, both
with flesh that softens but still holds together in cooking. There
are small Italian eggplants that need to be cooked much longer than
their size would suggest. There are long, thin Asian eggplants with
dense flesh that make a soft, velvety puree. They also work well in
a tian developed by Seen Lippert, formerly the chef at Across the
Street, now closed.
</P>
<P>
   Thai eggplants _ one varietal is called Kermit _ are small and
round, the size of a tangerine, and retain their shape and texture,
despite having a very thin skin. As they roast, they soften
slightly but still come out more like a pickled green tomato, with
a wet, almost crunchy texture, and with lots of seeds that pop in
your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   This is a complex family. Once you start cooking with eggplant,
recipes multiply quickly _ though 1,000 may take a few years to
accumulate. The more you work with the varieties, the more
difficult it will be to form generalizations. As Ms. Wolfert said,
``It's humbling.'' You must use your senses, experiment and give
this fruit your full attention. The mysterious, generous eggplant
seems to prefer it that way.

<P>
   TO EACH ACCORDING TO ITS TEXTURE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cooking, all eggplants are not created equal.
Some are best sauteed, others best after slow roasting.
</P>
<P>
   The standard large, heavy, deep purple eggplant is the
equivalent of an all-purpose potato, suitable for just about any
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Fragrant white eggplants have a tight flesh, which becomes
tender and buttery but does not fall apart like a large purple
eggplant when sauteed, or even like a pale lavender one. All three
when roasted cook to an almost pudding-like texture that makes them
perfect for purees.
</P>
<P>
   Small Italian eggplants are best cooked longer than other
varieties. Long, thin Asian eggplants are lovely roasted; they make
a soft, velvety puree. Bambinos are also nice for roasting,
emerging like a slow-roasted tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Kermit eggplants are small and round, and are best for simmering
in stews or sauces.

TV NOTES: FOR `MILLIONAIRE,' THE QUESTION IS WHAT NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' now in its
second week of broadcasts, is the talk of the television world this
summer. It has surpassed the status of mere hit to emerge as a
national phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The show on Sunday drew its largest audience yet, 15 million
viewers, more than for any other show on television in the last
weekly rating period.
</P>
<P>
   Now ABC executives are playing the role of contestants at their
own high-stakes game. What do they do with the show, which is
scheduled to end this week? The question has multiple-choice
answers and there is big, big money _ a lot more than $1 million _
riding on the right selection.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready, ABC? At a time when prime-time ratings are down
almost everywhere in broadcast television, you have a summer show
that has built on its audience every night for more than one week
straight. How best to capitalize on its potential?
</P>
<P>
   A) Make it a weekly show: throw it into prime time as quickly as
possible and guarantee yourself a new Top 10-rated series for this
television season.
</P>
<P>
   B) Keep it as an occasional, enormously promotable event: Maybe
bring it back every ratings-sweep month, three times a year for
two-week bursts at a time. That is the way it has been done in
Britain, where ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' originated, and it
has been bigger each time it has been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   C) Make it a three-or-four-times-a-week like NBC's ``Dateline''
or ABC's ``20/20'': that way you can take better advantage of the
suspense that builds when a contestant gets a roll going.
</P>
<P>
   D) Keep it as a summer show: that way it would face weaker
competition and can thrive as a steady source of ratings amid the
repeats.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the show's finale scheduled this Sunday at 8:30 p.m.,
ABC has to face that question. And to borrow another catchword from
the show, the network may look for a lifeline by conducting
research to see how an audience that supports the show would like
it to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a deceptively simple trivia quiz in which
contestants answer questions of escalating difficulty for rapidly
increasing amounts of money. Most critics have called the show's
concept intriguing, especially for its novel introduction of the
so-called lifelines, in which contestants can get help on answers.
Several critics have pointed out that the show has a style that
seems to have come straight from the 1950s, the last time game
shows were hits in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   That it will continue is now a given. Michael Davies, the
executive producer, said he had already been told to keep his staff
on the payroll. He is also on the hunt for a new studio, because,
he said, the current studio looks as if it will not be available
for an early comeback. ``I'd be shocked if it wasn't back on as
soon as the fall,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean a return in November, the season's first
ratings-sweep month, or, he said, ``We might be back as soon as
October.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Davies himself, who was so confident that the show would be a
hit that he quit his job as a vice president for alternative
programming at ABC to become the show's executive producer, said he
was torn about the choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back and forth from a position saying we should keep it
as an event to a position saying we should strike while the iron is
hot and go for something regular in prime time right away, maybe
like the `20/20' format, a few times a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davies pointed out that in Britain the show had adapted itself
to certain events, putting on special editions like a
movie-oriented version geared to the British version of the Oscars
and a sports version geared to the soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ABC owned the rights to the Oscar broadcast and to
the Super Bowl this year, making it an ideal year for specially
tailored editions of his game.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The show's host, Regis Philbin, who auditioned for the job
aggressively once he had seen the British version, said he was
totally committed to sticking with the show no matter what format
it followed in the future. But he added: ``I think we need to be on
successive nights. I don't think we should be a once-a-week show. I
think having at least a hour on Sunday night would be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies said there were elements he would tinker with whenever he
brought the show back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to simplify the phone-in format,'' he said of the
first round, in which contestants at home qualify by answering
questions over the phone. He said he also wanted to devise a fair
way to diversify the contestants. The show has featured mainly men;
only two female finalists have played the game on its first eight
editions and on several nights the entire roster of 10 potential
contestants were men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd also like to see more minority representation,'' Davies
said. The contestants have all been white. ``Maybe the skew of the
material has been geared to white males, I'm not sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate plan, Davies said: ``I want to be doing
this the rest of my life. There's no doubt about that.''

</P>
<P>
   Some couch potatoes showed that they were eager for the new
season to begin. On Monday night, UPN was the first broadcast
network out of the starting gate, kicking off its 1999-2000 season
and attracting, by UPN standards, quite a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The UPN season began with ``Moesha,'' the family comedy starring
Brandy, at 8 p.m. (moved from Tuesdays), followed by a new sitcom
starring Jaleel White, ``Grown-Ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is its fifth season, ``Moesha'' showed no sign of
fading in favor, at least on its opening night. The first episode,
in which Moesha takes an entry-level job at Vibe magazine instead
of going to college, earned a 4.4 overnight rating (a Nielsen
measure taken in the nation's larger cities; each rating point
equals 598,000 homes) and 7 share (percentage of homes watching
television tuned to that show), which was 10 percent better than
the numbers for last year's season premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown-Ups'' did even better, attracting a 4.9 overnight rating
and an 8 share, UPN's best overnight numbers since April 1998 and
virtually double the audience that UPN averaged for that time slot
(8:30 p.m. Mondays) in the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a veteran series to debut in a new time period on a new
night and improve, as `Moesha' did, is encouraging,'' said Tom
Nunan, UPN's entertainment president. ``For Jaleel White and
`Grown-Ups' to build on that number is even more encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Berman, who follows Nielsen ratings trends for Mediaweek
Online, said the overnight numbers would probably translate into a
low three rating when the total national numbers are in, which
would be nothing to brag about at ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC, but would
be better than UPN, perennially the sixth-place network, did on
most nights last season. _  &QR;

NEW POSTER WOMAN FOR LIBERATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Aug. 31)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we celebrate another anniversary of women getting the vote,
we mark a new triumph: that Hollywood has finally paired a
middle-aged heroine with a middle-aged hero and they have great
desktop sex.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder what Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the
other stalwarts might be thinking. ``All our work and now all you
want is to be a sex object at any age?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a big marker in the advances of women but it is a small
step for womankind that in the summertime hit ``The Thomas Crown
Affair,'' an adult woman gets the man instead of the man getting
the girl.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, with 47-year-old Pierce Bronsan and 45-year-old Rene
Russo, two people who in real life could have gone to high school
together, has sparked headlines such as ``Russo not ashamed to look
45!''
</P>
<P>
   This is equality, 1999 style.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Mary Ruthsdotter from the National Women's History
Project if the suffragists worried much about losing their sex
appeal and she chuckled. ``No, and I don't think they would have
used the term.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they were trying not to have their value tied to men.
When Stanton wanted to rent an assembly hall for a suffragists
meeting her husband had to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, our foremothers didn't march for the right to remain
sexy past the age of 40, or 50 and so on. They were passionate
about larger issues like getting property rights for women, equal
pay for equal work, and access to the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   They might not have foreseen, however, that as women continued
to push for equality, they'd meet a cultural backlash that said go
ahead and advance, but forget the black satin. As women slowly
began to enjoy advantages once held only by men, Hollywood cut a
secret deal. For having to share the perks of life in all other
arenas, men would be granted eternal hunkability. Women might
demonstrate their new-found status in movie roles which had them
being surgeons and scientists, but they wouldn't get to have sex
much past the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   Were Susan B. and the sisters to try to gauge the status of
American women today by how they're portrayed in film and
television, they might wonder what awful plague carried off the
mature women or turned them into background characters in aprons
and bad shoes.
</P>
<P>
   They might wonder why women of such obvious talent as Meryl
Streep and Jessica Lange ended up playing dying mothers and
shrewish spinsters. More important, they might ask the very good
question of why ordinary American women attach their self-esteem to
movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   But then, they wouldn't understand the power of the media today
to bend reality to fantasy and how, in many ways, the celluloid
ceiling has been as hard to crack as the glass one. If the
fantasy-makers say that women over a certain age are has-beens,
real life women take it personally.
</P>
<P>
   Younger has not always been hotter. By the time America
discovered Sarah Bernhardt when she was the world's greatest sex
symbol, she was in her 60s and had a wooden leg.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood is pretty good at propaganda, and for some time
now it's been making women, as Molly Haskell says, the designated
agers. Even highly acclaimed actresses have been getting dumped
just for hitting their 40s and 50s, even though their male
counterparts go on to score.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic roles dry up for women after 40, and Hollywood would
have us believe so do women in general. Real women know this is far
from the truth, just as the idea of the perpetual stud is more
about the Hollywood male ego than the average guy's. But some like
to pretend there's little romance between same-age couples. Sean
Connery enjoyed an enlightened pairing with Gena Rowlands in one
movie but by the next was dating someone's granddaughter. Susan
Sarandon at 51 played a woman with two men in love with her, but
they were both in their 70s. When Anne Bancroft played older woman
to Dustin Hoffman _ his girlfriend's mother _ in ``The Graduate,''
he was 30 and she was 36. We don't want to make too much of this,
of course. ``Thomas Crown'' is just a movie and Russo was not cast
in the role just to be fair to 45-year-olds but because she is a
beautiful and very fit 45-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still worth a whoop and a holler to see a brainy,
passionate on-screen woman whose dewy face could be the result of a
hot flash.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's more to the movie than the fact that Russo
bares her top and Bronsan his bottom and they're both amazingly
nimble. Her Catherine is every bit as devious, manipulative and
arrogant as his Thomas. I guess that's another kind of equality,
but I'm not sure those who led women to win the vote 79 years ago
had that in mind, either.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of heavy showers and some thunderstorms will swirl
around a low- pressure center as it meanders eastward through the
Ohio Valley. Weak high- level winds will encourage very slow-moving
showers in the southeastern Great Lakes and northern Ohio Valley,
resulting in areas of local flooding. In the wake of the
disturbance, very warm weather will cover most of the northern and
central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A moist flow from the Atlantic will promote clouds and showers
from the Carolinas to the interior Northeast. The steadiest rain is
expected near the Appalachians from Virginia to Pennsylvania where
the damp winds ascend the sloping terrain. Meanwhile, high pressure
east of New England will keep most of the Northeast coast dry for
much of the day, but clouds and showers will spread over the area
from the southwest at night.
</P>
<P>
   Some strong thunderstorms will develop in the sultry air ahead
of a front in the interior Southeast. Behind the front, drier air
will spread into the western Tennessee Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers from the remnants of Hurricane Bret will continue
to plague parts of the Rio Grande Valley. Farther north, the
interior West will stay warm with afternoon thunderstorms over the
central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Offshore winds will sponsor hot weather near the California
coast. Meanwhile, a few thunderstorms will erupt near the southern
Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Dennis will continue to intensify as it moves
toward the eastern Bahamas. The storm may threaten the Atlantic
seaboard late in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Houston Heat
</P>
<P>
   The mercury rose only to 91 degrees in Houston on Monday,
putting an end to the city's streak of 27 consecutive days with
readings of 95 degrees or higher. The 27-day streak ranks fourth on
Houston's all-time list, not far behind the first-place total of 41
consecutive days set in July and August of 1993. August marked the
peak of the heat, with the mercury reaching 100 degrees on seven
days, a total that ranks third on Houston's all-time list of hot
Augusts. Though this month will be remembered as one of Houston's
hottest and driest Augusts, June and July were very close to
average.

A SPECTACULAR MEETING OF SCULPTURE AND SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ The most impressive exhibition of contemporary
sculpture in a decade, or maybe more, is the show of Richard
Serra's ``Torqued Ellipses'' here at the Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   Serra and Frank Gehry, the museum's architect, are old friends
who don't just speak a related language; they have invented the
same sort of elastic, twisting volumes. And the placement of eight
of Serra's gigantic ellipses with his 174-ton, 104-foot-long
``Snake,'' which was already parked in the immense ground-floor
gallery of the museum, is like a declaration on the part of artist
and architect. It is as if they were saying: this is what
architecture, carried to a creative extreme, can do for an art that
is strong enough and sympathetic enough to deal with it, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's room, called the ``fish'' because its shape more or less
resembles the inside of a whale, is part of what is surely the most
spectacular museum since Wright's Guggenheim opened in New York 40
years ago. But the persistent question has been whether any art can
thrive in what is really a monumental sculpture. At 433 feet long,
a third again as long as a football field, the ``fish'' dwarfs the
most enormous works of art. The accomplishment of Serra's show is
not so much to match its size _ even these sculptures can't _ but
to make a public space into a series of private ones.
</P>
<P>
   An artist's job today seems to involve working around
architecture. Architecture is often the principal attraction. The
most memorable sights in the current Venice Biennale are the
renovated shipyard buildings in which one section of the show takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   This situation isn't entirely new. Artists stopped regarding the
white cube as a neutral receptacle, an ethically blank exhibition
space, in the '70s, and they became attuned to how galleries affect
the art. Architecture, liberated in the process from the
predictability of the modernist box, turned increasingly assertive.
Now the relationship between art and architecture is competitive,
with artists frequently left to cope with adversarial spaces.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible for any artist showing work at the Guggenheim
here to avoid dealing with its audacious design. Other artists,
unlike Serra in style but alert to the issues of manipulating
sculptural forms, might be able to turn Gehry's Guggenheim to their
advantage, too _ Matthew Barney, maybe, because he is innately
theatrical, or Richard Tuttle, despite the fact that his sculptures
are small, because he makes works to interact with the rooms they
occupy. But the list will be short.
</P>
<P>
   Serra has the advantage of having installed his ``Torqued
Ellipses'' elsewhere. Three of them were shown at the Dia Center
for the Arts in New York a couple of years ago, all eight in Los
Angeles after that.
</P>
<P>
   Being unlike other modern sculptures, they are difficult to
describe. Each one consists of multiple 40-ton, 16-foot steel
plates, bent and twisted at a shipyard and rolling mill in Maryland
that is one of the only places equipped to deal with plates so big
and shapes so odd. They describe free-standing oval enclosures.
Every enclosure has a cut, or opening, so that the sculpture can be
entered. Three of the eight sculptures are also double ellipses,
meaning that one enclosure is contained within another, like
Russian nesting dolls. The degree of torque, or twist, varies from
sculpture to sculpture. One ellipse has a cut at the long end of
the oval, another in the middle. One is twisted so that the walls
seem, from inside, to bellow. Another seems static. The forms run
the gamut. Altogether they make a series.
</P>
<P>
   Serra's inspiration was Baroque architecture. He had been
looking at Borromini. But he was also, it seems, revisiting ideas
from his own early rubber sculptures of the '60s, like ``Belts,''
trying to meld their fluid, draped forms to space-defining steel
works, like ``Circuit'' and ``Terminal,'' that he made in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of the ``Torqued Ellipses'' has a lot to do with the
fact that they are made of steel: steel treated like rubber seems
an impossibility, and the effect is to convey what Serra calls a
kind of ``gravitational pull.'' It's easy to picture concrete being
cast in eccentric forms, but steel, twisted unexpectedly, is
disorienting.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry and Serra clearly are soul mates in their formal and
technological ambitions. Gehry eschewed post-modern pastiche in the
'80s, sticking to industrial materials and new forms, which have
also been Serra's interests. The two of them look to invent
abstract shapes. They think on a vast scale. They're late
modernists pushing at the limits of machine technology and size,
but they also share a sense of the dance, which is to say, the art
of moving people through space.
</P>
<P>
   To grasp this show's particular choreography, bear in mind the
simple differences between a big space and a small space. Intimate
spaces invite repose. Large spaces are about movement; they ask to
be crossed. Walking suits certain kinds of art and not others.
Rodin, for example, might survive in Gehry's room, playing off a
common root in Baroque motion. But Giacometti would not do so well.
Oldenburg's ``Knife Ship,'' when it was here at the Guggenheim's
opening, looked absurd. It is the same close-up or far away. There
was no reason to walk to it. Scale being relative, it didn't even
look big, which it is meant to, in the context.

 BILBAO: the context.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serra's sculptures are about walking. They're meant to be
experienced on the move. No work appears the same from two
different points. They create pathways into and around the ellipses
and from one sculpture to another. Three of the eight ellipses are
placed at the front of the room, five at the back with ``Snake'' in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake'' is like the dash in a sentence, separating and setting
off one statement from another. Made of dissimilar S-shaped plates
standing on end, bunched, it forms canyonlike passageways that have
an effect akin to the interior of the double ellipses, but less
memorable. The tension of walking within the double walls of one of
the double ellipses, where the tight spaces become cramped and tilt
steeply, provokes alarm, then exhilaration. There's nothing close
to this feeling with ``Snake.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Snake'' matters very much to the pacing of the show,
breaking up Gehry's room into parts, varying its rhythm, activating
the giant central third of the gallery. Serra has found a way to
insure that the exhibition shapes the room, not the other way
around, a complicated problem that has to do with moving viewers
through spaces in ways determined by the orientation of the art.
</P>
<P>
   To activate all of the spaces around the sculptures, including
the ones between the sculptures and the walls, no ellipse was
placed farther than 13 feet from another _ a considerable feat of
planning: parts of the floor couldn't support the weight of a
sculpture, so placement was affected by load-bearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But all rooms set limits on the art they contain. At Dia, in the
building on West 22d Street in Manhattan that used to be the Arnulf
Rainer Museum, the ellipses rose nearly to the trusses of the
skylighted ceiling, a limitation of height that produced a feeling
of intimacy but also placed the sculpture and architecture in
tension.
</P>
<P>
   Here, beneath a vast ceiling that ought to diminish the
sculptures, with light pouring into the room, the ellipses look
even taller than they did at Dia. This sounds contradictory, but
seen from inside, the dark ellipses ``ground'' the room: they draw
a viewer's gaze first down to the floor, then up toward the light,
emphasizing verticality. One's eyes rise to the rim of the
sculpture, then higher, to the curved shapes of the ceiling, which
echo the curves of the ellipses in ways carefully calculated by
Serra when he was working with the Guggenheim's curators Carmen
Gimenez and Susan Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The result, you might say, is to reveal the room through the
sculpture. Art precedes architecture in this case, then does a jig
with it.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk at the Guggenheim about eventually splitting
Gehry's gallery into sections, putting up walls. He had originally
proposed this, but the museum's director, Tom Krens, an agoraphile,
said no. So far, against the odds, the museum has managed in most
cases to make Gehry's architecture work. A retrospective of the
Basque abstract sculptor Eduardo Chillida is also here at the
moment, installed in several galleries that are almost as
peculiarly shaped as the ``fish.'' It looks at home. The Serra
show, here though Oct. 17, is the strongest argument yet against
partitioning. But will anything else look as good?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the sculptor Richard Serra should not have been
surprised when he recently spied a woman who, thinking she was
alone, danced through one of his ``Torqued Ellipses'' at the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. His rounded, listing, walk-in
steel sculptures and the long arched gallery of the architect Frank
Gehry glide and curve together in a pas de deux of balletic grace.
Clearly she was inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The dance between Serra's sculpture and Gehry's architecture is
not simply serendipitous. ``Frank and I have been talking to each
other through our work for years,'' says Serra by telephone from
Nova Scotia. ``We find each other very useful. If I say to Frank,
`I have a space 30 feet by 30 feet by 30 feet,' we are both on the
same page; he understands the quality of the volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not that he looks at my work and I look at his, and
together we figure out how to make the next move. We bring each
other support and criticism. The influence is not direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago the worlds of art and architecture were very
separate; even the art-collecting architect Philip Johnson said in
the early 1980s that he never mixed art into the design of his
buildings. But in the '60s Gehry had already outraged his
colleagues by incorporating into his work ideas absorbed from the
artists he palled around with _ first in California and then in New
York. His own breakthrough house, in Santa Monica in 1979, was a
live-in art installation that first put him on Serra's radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an eye opener for everyone,'' says Serra. ``Frank
took the inside and threw it out the window. He really built the
new house around the old _ one continuous inside-outside house. And
he did it with all those raw materials, like cyclone fencing. I
thought, `Pretty good, Frank.'''
</P>
<P>
   The admiration was mutual. ``His sculpture was raw and powerful,
emotional and threatening _ and minimal,'' says Gehry by phone from
Los Angeles. ``Here was a guy who was pushing building-scale stuff
around, and he got the most effect with the fewest number of
moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Their brotherhood was also a defensive compact against
post-modernism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, for a while we were marginalized,''
says Serra. ``Back in the '70s and '80s, neither of us was part of
the pastiche, plagiarism and parody of post-modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 show, the two collaborated on a hypothetical bridge in
New York City connecting the Chrysler Building to the Twin Towers
of the World Trade Center, both ends tethered by pylons: Serra's
was a steel mast rising from the East River, Gehry's a fish
bounding from the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The skyscraper fish, complete with scales, was Gehry's coy
answer to post-modern historicism (``It's a much older form,'' he
says, deadpan), and Serra encouraged the exploration. ``If you
think of the fish as a fuselage, then you can see the form in
different ways _ a carp differs from a sturgeon. I was interested
in the variety of the curvilinear volumes; the fishiness of the
fish never got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Gehry designed the Fishdance Restaurant in Kobe, Japan,
and later several room-size fish installations with wooden ribs,
each tensed with twisting movement. Working with piscine shapes
gave him the confidence to build difficult compound curves. But
once he chopped off the head and tail and filleted the body, the
fish yielded abstract, sinuous planes that started to resemble the
curved steel plates that Serra had already been working on for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not possessive in terms of my work that way,'' says Serra.
``I don't think anybody can beat you at your own game. I don't
think anybody can beat Frank at his. Frank really understands the
history of art, particularly his own generation's, and he's
digested it, translated it, reinterpreted it, put it into his own
language. His work doesn't look like watered-down artistic
conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry recalls Serra's visit to the California Aerospace Museum
he designed in 1984 in Los Angeles, where a two-story faceted and
torqued shape leans out from the facade, as if straining under
liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard looked at those leaning walls and said, `That taught
me something about the feeling of being under a wall.' In his next
piece, he tilted the walls out.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 competition for a footbridge across the Thames in
London linking the area around St. Paul's Cathedral with the new
Tate Gallery on Bankside, the artist and architect again
collaborated, producing a lyrically curved and arched steel truss
poised on two spring points, which Serra believes neither
collaborator would have produced alone. Gehry says, ``Richard
really got into the design process as an architect would _ into the
reality of the handrails, the texture of the surfaces, the function
and engineering of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for an honesty that can be brutal, Serra didn't like the
front facade of one of Gehry's late designs for the Walt Disney
Hall in Los Angeles, a building that was being hailed as a
masterpiece. ``Richard came by and said I had to change it, and
when he left, I knew he was right,'' says Gehry. ``I solved it with
a curved form that looked a lot like one of Richard's pieces. Then
he saw the results and said that's his piece and asked if he could
do that wall. But, of course, I couldn't take a chunk of the
building out.''
</P>
<P>
   On another studio visit, Serra cut slots for windows in tubular
forms that the architect was composing into a house. ``I used his
idea because it was better than mine,'' says Gehry, ``and Richard
said the round forms excited him, so I was playing in an arena and
he got into it. While he was cutting these shapes, he started
thinking of the `Torqued Ellipses.'''
</P>
<P>
   M R. Serra credits a visit to San Carlo, a baroque church in
Rome by Borromini, as the direct inspiration for the ``Torqued
Ellipses.'' Serra wondered how walls would connect the elliptical
plan and ceiling if the ceiling were rotated 90 degrees, and Gehry
suggested that the sculptor consult about the elusive shapes with
Rick Smith, an aerospace computer expert working in ice on
the Bilbao Guggenheim. The computer program Catia was used to
develop the French Mirage jet. ``When I'm out in Los Angeles, I go
and work with Rick early in themornings when I can book computer
time,'' says Serra.
</P>
<P>
   Independently and jointly, both the artist and architect came to
work on irregular curves, but Catia enabled the two to invent ever
more complex, doubly curved geometries that have pushed their most
recent work into the esthetic complicity that has drawn 300,000
people over the last three months to out-of-the-way Bilbao. (The
show originated earlier this year at the more accessible Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where Richard Koshalek and Julia
Brown were the curators.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interconnection between the curvilinearity of
Frank's building and the obvious torquing of my pieces,'' says
Serra. ``So when you're in them, you kind of spin from the
architecture into the pieces and vice versa. The ellipses play off
the architecture and take on a new quality in Frank's building.''

   CHINA-SECT (Shanghai, China) _ Chinese authorities announce they
are preparing to prosecute top leaders of Falun Gong, a signal that
China has reached the final stage of its broadest political
mobilization campaign in a decade. Falun Gong, a spiritual movement
of more than 20 million members that badly spooked China's leaders
with its ability to organize potent anti-government protests, was
banned last month as the Communist Party galvanized its vast
apparatus in a sweeping crackdown aimed at snuffing out political
dissent. By Seth Faison.

   BERGER-PROFILE (Washington) _ Widely regarded as the president's
closest foreign policy aide, perhaps the most influential national
security adviser since Henry A. Kissinger, Sandy Berger he is at
bottom a political rather than strategic figure. Unlike the
professors, diplomats and military officers who have for the most
part preceded him in his job, he made his way to the White House by
way of the salons and back rooms of Democratic politics. By R.W.

   KAN-EVOLUTION (Topeka, Kan.) _ The decision by the Kansas Board
of Education to delete mention of evolution from the science
textbooks has, instead of settling the issue, reignited passions on
both sides. For some, the move finally opens the door to let them
teach their own beliefs in things like ``intelligent design,''
which means a leaf is so beautifully complex it must have been
planned by a high intelligence. For others, the move is meaningless
because it is not mandatory. Many, including many science teachers,
plan on ignoring the advice of the board and teaching evolution
anyhow. By Jacques Steinberg.

<P>
   CHAT-ROOM-SYPHILIS (San Francisco) _ In the first case where a
disease cluster has been traced to the Internet, public health
officials here have tracked an outbreak of syphilis to an America
Online chat room. Officials from the San Francisco Department of
Public Health said that six men who have contracted syphilis since
mid-June have traced their last sexual encounters to partners they
met through an America Online chat room called San Francisco Men 4
Men (SFM4M). The situation has posed a unique problem for health
officials, since some of the infected men know their multiple
partners only by their cyberspace nicknames, or ``handles.'' Since
America Online refused to divulge the identities of its chat room
users, the only way to contact all the men the syphilis-infected
men had sex with has been by posting warnings in the chat room. By

   ISRAEL-EXTRADITE (Washington) _ A Maryland teen-ager who has
been the subject of a 17-month extradition battle between the
United States and Israel has agreed to plead guilty to murder and
accept a 24-year prison sentence in Israel, state prosecutors in
Maryland announced on Tuesday. By Philip Shenon.

<P>
   FED-RATES (Washington) _ The Federal Reserve voted to raise
interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for the second
time in less than two months, saying the action would help avert
inflation while allowing the long economic expansion to continue.
The central bank said it would increase the main rate it controls,
the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, to
5.25 percent from 5 percent. It said it would raise its discount
rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4.75
percent from 4.5 percent. By Richard W. Stevenson.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last June, American architecture took a giant step
into the present with the announcement that Elizabeth Diller and
Ricardo Scofidio, two architects who practice together in New York,
had been awarded a fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation. This
is the first time that the coveted award has been presented to
architects.
</P>
<P>
   The award was beautifully timed. With only a few conventially
built projects to their credit, Ms. Diller and Scofidio are best
known for temporary, mixed-media installations, often commissioned
by museums and public art funds. In the last year, however, they
have expanded their practice beyond these elite venues. Earlier
this year, the pair completed a 100-unit apartment block in Gifu,
Japan. They are now working on large projects in San Francisco, at
Kennedy International Airport and Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Such projects represent a departure for these architects, at
least in terms of public recognition. They are already stars in
academia. Ms. Diller, 44, is an associate professor at Princeton
University's graduate school of architecture. Scofidio, 63, is a
professor at Cooper Union in New York. The two have published their
own projects in books like ``Flesh'' and ``Back to the Front'' and
been written about in highbrow journals like ANY and Assemblage.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the MacArthur Foundation chose to honor them
for developing their practice outside the usual commercial routes.
Even so, many who have followed their work have been hoping that
these two would get a bit more commercial. We'll be lining up this
October, when the first restaurant they have designed opens in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the basement of the Seagram Building, the new
Brasserie replaces a restaurant of the same name designed by Philip
Johnson in 1959. Johnson had just collaborated on the Seagram
Building with Mies van der Rohe, the chief architect. The
Brasserie, famous for its onion soup, 24-hour service and
conveyer-belt delivery, was intended as a cut-rate counterpoint to
the glittering Four Seasons upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diller and Scofidio's updated version offers a salient set
of variations on Miesian themes. This will be a snazzy place, with
illuminated glass walls, plastic fixtures and a lavish use of video
technology. But customers will also get a slice of history. Ms.
Diller and Scofidio specialize in projects that heighten our
awareness of our place in history. Their Brasserie throws a light
on the distance from Miess' time to our own.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other American architects in recent years, Ms. Diller
and Scofidio have been working to correct the clownish view of
history put forth by the post-modern movement and its callow
promoters. The clowns took a knock two years ago, with the opening
of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Frank Gehry's design
awakened many to the idea that buildings articulate their place in
time. Ms. Diller and Scofidio's work shows that historical
awareness can take many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Their temporary installations have typically revolved around
broad cultural themes, like tourism, gardening and real estate
development. Using video screens and projections, photographs,
printed text and a range of motley objects, these projects share no
single formal vocabulary. But they exhibit a common intellectual
approach. Far more than the formalist designs selected for the
Museum of Modern Arts' numbing ``Deconstructivist Architecture''
show in 1988, this work recalls the aggressive stance of Jacques
Derrida. Rigorously analytic, sometimes chilly, always playful,
they are intellectual comedies in a profession where intellect and
the comic sense are in notably short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Ms. Diller and Scofidio practice a form of
meta-architecture. Rather than produce buildings, they analyze the
cultural forces that produce buildings. They explore the ways
architecture itself functions in the postindustrial world.
Reckoning with their work requires a fresh critical vocabulary, one
that deals (like movie criticism) with content as well as form.
</P>
<P>
   Its apt that Ms. Diller and Scofidio's first large-scale New
York project is a restaurant interior, that icon of ephemeral
design. Fitting, too, that they were recommended for the job by
Phyllis Lambert, a Bronfman family member who proposed Mies for the
Seagram Building commission more than 40 years ago. Both choices
reflect a keen sense of the zeitgeist that have also colored the
shows she organized at the Canadian Center for Architecture for
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The new Brasserie design, for which Charles Renfrew is project
architect, retains a few elements from the old. As before, patrons
will enter the restaurant through a revolving door. A staircase, a
redesigned version of the most memorable feature in Johnson's
scheme, descends from street level to the main dining room. An
annex to the right of the entrance opens off the rear of the main
dining room. Otherwise, the place will be unrecognizable. And it
won't be open around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The main dining room will be set within a thin shell of molded
pear wood. One side will be lined with booths. The bar is directly
opposite. Above it, a row of video monitors will screen blurred
images of patrons as they come through the revolving door: an
electronic salute to the nightclub photographers of another day.
</P>
<P>
   Video imagery gets great play here. In the small entrance lobby,
a flat panel screen will display a manipulated real-time picture of
the 53d Street sidewalk just outside. A second panel will show
morphing images, perhaps of Ricky Martin transmuted into Carmen
Miranda. Cool!

 NEW YORK: Miranda. Cool!  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Table tops fashioned from thick slabs of translucent, pale green
resin. Bar stools cushioned with silicon seats of resilient,
buttock-shaped contours. Lots of glass: a honeycomb glass divider
between men's and women's restrooms; translucent glass treads and
risers on the entry stair; in the annex dining room, sloping panes
of glass that support cantilevered banquettes. In the same room, a
partition of thin pear wood veneer enclosing a circle of red light.
Hot!
</P>
<P>
   The new Brasserie's location may be East 53d Street, but its
context is the history of ideas. The architects accept as a given
that the Seagram Building is a key landmark in that history, a work
whose roots go back to the Industrial Revolution, the
Enlightenment, Renaissance classicism and beyond. Ms. Diller's and
Scofidio's design is a further offshoot of that history.
</P>
<P>
   They have described the Seagram basement as Mies' subconscious.
The space was not designed to be habitable. It is a maze of columns
and beams belied by the tower's crisp, rational facade. The new
Brasserie design brings this subterranean world into the
(artificial) light. It peers at the difference between Mies'
intentions and the results he achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For architects of Mies' generation, for example, glass held
symbolic connotations. It symbolized a modern society of clarity,
reason and integrity that they hoped their designs would encourage.
With Ms. Diller and Scofidio, glass becomes an instrument for
creating illusion and provoking voyeurism. Again, in the classic
Miesian tower, glass is draped over structure. In the Brasserie,
glass will be used structurally, to support banquettes in the
annex.
</P>
<P>
   The most important link to Mies' plan is the emphasis Ms. Diller
and Scofidio have placed on the relationship between interior and
exterior space. In the procession from the street, across the
plaza, into the elevator lobby on Park Avenue , Mies dramatized the
reduction of the Seagram Building's wall to a transparent membrane
and the erosion of the division between interior and exterior
space. Ms. Diller and Scofidio pick up the theme with an interplay
between openness and enclosure, evident in the spatial relationship
between the booths and the bar, and in the screening device of the
pear wood shell.
</P>
<P>
   The video gadgets elaborate the theme. In place of direct views
of the street, the design substitutes media renditions of the
sidewalk and entering patrons. This runs contrary to the Miesian
ideal of transparency. But, in fact, even with Mies' design, the
experience was mediated by the play of reflections, the pink tint
of the glass, the framing of views provided by columns and window
mullions: Structure and materials induced a clear separation
between inside and outside, turning each into a spectacle of
inclusion and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diller and Scofidio update these effects for a time when
mediated reality has partly displaced direct social contact. They
remind us that Mies, too, was a meta-architect, a man who reduced
building to the spare essentials of structure and space. ``Almost
nothing'' was the phrase Mies used to describe his work. He saw
himself as a zeitgeist channeler. His work was more about letting
it happen than about making it happen. As Mies put it, architecture
is the will of an epoch translated into space. In the basement of
his masterpiece, we will see that the epoch has changed more
swiftly than Mies could have known.

A SINGLE-SEX MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For me, taking sides in the gender wars is usually
a breeze. My sympathy is with my sex.
</P>
<P>
   Too many men still don't get it, after all these decades of
equal rights legislation and sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   As individuals, a lot of them are swell. I married one that is.
But collectively the male animal still tends to hog the best jobs,
resent affirmative action and stick women with the lion's share of
the child-rearing and household duties. It ain't fair.
</P>
<P>
   But a stunning example of feminism gone bananas turned up
recently and it's only fair to acknowledge that my side makes
mistakes too. This one's a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College brought it to our attention this summer by
forcing a tenured professor, Mary Daly, 70, into retirement. A
teacher of feminist ethics, Daly did not go gracefully. She is
angrily suing for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is that the college did not give her the boot sooner.
For more than two decades, she had refused to teach male students,
insisting on sharing her educational insights only with other
females. The college finally developed a spine when a male student
who was locked out of her classroom complained to the Center for
Individual Rights, an advocacy group in the nation's capital which
threatened to file a discrimination suit on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has a reputation as a radical feminist, well known for her
hardline defense of same-sex education and what she calls ``women
space.'' But her brand of feminism does women no favor. She was not
advancing the cause of women's rights; she was betraying it. Women
deserve equality, not favoritism that sets them apart.
</P>
<P>
   The professor thinks female students are so intimidated by the
opposite sex that they can't learn to stand up for themselves
properly if males are studying in the same room. ``Women in classes
with men ... have to be sexy and they can't really think,'' Daly
said on National Public Radio after her forced departure. This is
also the theory behind the few private schools in the country that
admit only women.
</P>
<P>
   But an artificial single-sex school setting is no preparation
for the real world, in which women work side-by-side with men, deal
with them socially and professionally and relate to them both
intellectually and emotionally. Delaying integration merely puts
off the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Segregation of the sexes in a classroom or anywhere else except
a boxing mat or a public toilet is stupid. In most cases it is also
morally, ethically and legally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, a Jesuit-run Catholic university, is a
coeducational institution that receives federal funds in the form
of research grants and various student assistance. Title IX of a
1972 civil rights law bars gender discrimination in programs and
services at schools that receive taxpayer funds. Women, you see,
pay taxes just as men do and therefore have a right to share the
resultant benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It was under this law that the courts forced the Virginia
Military Institute and ultimately the Citadel, famous bastions of
the male military establishment, to reluctantly admit female
recruits. If the women met the physical and intellectual
requirements, they could not be denied entry simply because of
their gender. Both schools have survived the change.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same principle that makes Daly's position impossible
to defend. Yet some feminists like Gloria Steinem can't accept this
rebuke of their friend and have echoed Daly's
women-are-repressed-and-need-special-help theme. They have also
suggested ominously that Daly's removal is part of a political
backlash against feminism and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point, but not the one they meant to make. A
backlash is usually generated by outrage over some policy or
philosophy that has exceeded rational bounds and lost broad popular
support. And outraged we are. Daly went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping male students at bay may have seemed like a bright idea
when Daly began ideologically thrashing the masculine power
structure long ago. The women's movement was still fragile and did
not pick up steam until the late 1970s. But we have come a long way
since then, men and women together, and continued progress in
rational interaction depends on cooperation rather than isolation.
</P>
<P>
   What Daly was doing is disturbing. She took advantage of her
control over her classroom to discriminate against male students
just as males in control of jobs and other economic opportunities
used to have free rein to discriminate against women. Turnabout is
not fair play. It is a violation of the Golden Rule: Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is a good one. Wars have been fought because rival
groups have not figured this out. Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanians are now persecuting the Serbs just as the Serbs recently
persecuted them, is a tragic, classic example.
</P>
<P>
   Daly doesn't belong in a college. She was sending her students
the wrong message.

ARTISTS TURN TO NEW FOUNDATION TO FILL VOID LEFT BY NEA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To judge by the experience of a new cultural support
foundation, many of the nation's artists are clamoring for
financial aid even in these prosperous times.
</P>
<P>
   By last week's deadline for the Creative Capital Foundation's
first round of grants, applications from 1,810 visual, performing
and media artists had flooded into the Greenwich Village office of
the new group. The foundation was formed to fill the gap created
when the National Endowment for the Arts ended most grants to
individuals in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That is 50 percent to 80 percent more than the 1,000 to 1,200
submissions expected by Creative Capital, which was started in May
to finance artists whose innovative, often difficult work
challenges society's conventions. So far, Creative Capital has
raised over $5 million from two dozen foundations and
philanthropists, including the Andy Warhol Foundation for the
Visual Arts, the Lily Auchincloss Foundation and the Thomas S.
Kenan Institute for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The applications, including about 600 that arrived on the final
day, came from artists in 46 states, the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico. The largest number by far, 720 or 40 percent,
originated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Lerner, Creative Capital's executive director, was elated
by the geographic spread. ``This says a lot about the need that is
out there, about the pent-up demand,'' she said, ``because we made
it clear that we were not talking about huge sums of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The grants will range from $5,000 to $20,000 and in this round
will go to 60 artists, or 3.3 percent of those who applied.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the late 1980s, the National Endowment awarded as
much as $10.5 million a year to more than 750 individuals, and in
fiscal year 1995, the last full year of grants, it received 9,036
applications and gave $7.1 million to 616 artists. Congress, after
years of controversy over grants to artists whose works dealt with
provocative themes, ordered it to halt most individual grants
(leaving only a few for literary, jazz and folk artists).
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital will disperse only about $1 million this year,
though that may increase if the organization realizes its hope of
raising $40 million. A small portion of Creative Capital's kitty is
also expected to come from artists who win grants, who must then
agree to return a small portion of any proceeds from their projects
to Creative Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,810 submissions, 30 percent came from visual artists,
26.4 percent from performing artists, 22 percent from artists in
emerging fields like computer and installation art and 21.6 percent
from film or video artists. The awards will be split equally among
the four areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, California came in second, with 285 submissions,
followed by Pennsylvania, with 67, and Texas, Illinois and
Massachusetts, with 55, 53 and 52 respectively. There were no
submissions from Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota or Utah. At first
glance, Ms. Lerner estimated that nearly three-quarters of the
applications came from emerging artists and only 1 or 2 percent
from established artists.
</P>
<P>
   The applications will now go to outside evaluators, who are to
choose about 200 finalists. They will be asked to submit detailed
plans, budgets, time frames and work samples. The awards should
come soon thereafter. ``I am determined to be able to say `Merry
Christmas' to 60 artists,'' Ms. Lerner said.

`THE SOURCE': THE SPIRIT OF THE BEATS, FROM COOL TO NONE TOO HIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Source,'' a stirring, kaleidescopic documentary about the
Beat generation and its legacy, spans from the exultant 1940s photo
of the young friends Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William
Burroughs to the ``Jeopardy'' show on which contestants could win
money by asking, ``Who were the Beats?'' (``Allen Ginsberg, Jack
Kerouac and Lawrence Ferlinghetti were part of this group of
writers.'')
</P>
<P>
   And it moves beyond, to the point of becoming a ghost story.
``It's eternity all the time, so there's no point being nostalgic
for eternity,'' Ginsberg (who died in 1997) is heard saying. But
that wisdom runs counter to the moving experience of watching this
film unfold.
</P>
<P>
   The wizardry of Chuck Workman is well known to viewers of the
Academy Awards broadcast, which has been brightened by his witty,
rapid-fire compilations of film clips. And his acumen remains just
as sharp in this feature-length format. Workman, who also made a
feature about Andy Warhol, indeed packs in so many different facets
of his subject matter that he would seem to risk glibness; this is,
after all, a film in which Bob Hope, Alfred Hitchcock and Fred
Flintstone can each be found going the goatee-and-beret route for
parody's sake. But ``The Source'' has been made much too knowingly
and affectionately to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Workman's comprehensiveness is an obvious virtue.
However well known the assorted Beat legends have become, there is
a cumulative power to seeing so many of them evoked so colorfully
in a single film. And even viewers who know a great deal about
Kerouac, for example, may be surprised by his later talk-show
appearances, like the one in which he blearily insisted that the
Vietnam War was a Vietnamese plot to garner American Jeeps. Or the
one in which he is blindsided by William F. Buckley Jr., who is
able to pronounce ``yippies'' as if it were a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   The film needn't delve explicitly into the none too hip side of
Kerouac revealed in his later years. The pictures seen here do a
lot of the storytelling by themselves, especially when images of
these rebels at their most young and beautiful are contrasted with
scenes of their later years. Dazzling scenes of Neal Cassady
dancing bare-chested, with the look of home-movie snippets and an
air of utter joy and abandon, speak volumes about why Cassady
became legendary even among his own friends. ``He wasn't destined
to grow old,'' Ferlinghetti says of him. ``He was always young and
he always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering a magic-bus trip down memory lane, ``The
Source'' has serious work to do: capturing the spirit of Beat
poetry, watching it evolve from passionate outpourings into a
source of caricature and following it through into later cultural
manifestations. In tune with the early years, several well-chosen
actors bring the writing to life: Johnny Depp intoning Kerouac,
John Turturro giving a fiercely emotional reading from Ginsberg's
``Howl'' and Dennis Hopper with the right hat and the right
attitude for echoing Burroughs. Perhaps the purest expression of
the Beat ethos comes slightly later, from Ken Kesey, who is asked
by an incredible interviewer: `` Kesey, do you feel that you have
the right to do what you want, whatever you want and still live in
this world?''
</P>
<P>
   Kesey answers: ``I feel that a man has a right to be as big as
he feels it in him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Source'' later makes connections with hippies, the '60s
anti-war movement and a '70s culture with an obvious debt to Beat
life-style experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the official recognition: official
commemorative ceremonies, Gap ads featuring Beats in khakis and
even Kerouac's words emblazoned on a coffee mug. The film could
excoriate these manifestations but instead finds them amusing. It
has no doubt that the Beats still have true descendants, and that
they keep the faith.

 &HT;    GSU joins world web of e-commerce studies
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's an underconstruction atmosphere at Georgia
State University's Center for Digital Commerce, which in a sense
mirrors the industry it's being set up to study.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there isn't much to look at, just piles of boxes and
empty cubicles in the business school's downtown classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   As with any Internet start-up, the faculty and staff at GSU are
hoping their ambitious plans to form a worldwide consortium to
teach the basics of conducting business in the global electronic
marketplace will make them the Amazon.com of e-commerce education.
But they are gambling and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   The program's premise is that the Internet is a global medium
for companies providing goods and services. Top managers now find
themselves grappling with policy, regulatory and social issues they
haven't had to tackle before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, insurance company Met Life ran into a worldwide
dilemma several years ago trying to launch its first Web site.
Between international regulations governing where the company is
permitted to sell insurance and copyright restrictions on the
``Peanuts'' cartoon characters the company uses in its ads, Met
Life faced roadblocks to doing business on the Web it didn't
encounter offline.
</P>
<P>
   The GSU program is designed to educate executives, policy makers
and entrepreneurs to manage such problems in the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the fall of 2000, the school will offer a program
called the global electronic master's degree, a venture between GSU
and some of the top business schools in Europe, Asia and North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Executives enrolled in the GSU program will take classes with
other students from top business schools all over the world.
Universities in Norway, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands,
Australia, Denmark and Australia and possibly Canada will take part
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed program of study will take 16 months to complete
and will include three week-long international seminars with
students at the other participating schools.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Welke, chairman of GSU's computer information systems
department, has also worked in the private sector and taught school
in Canada and the Netherlands. In 1995, Welke authored a white
paper for the Georgia Research Alliance suggesting the time was
right to develop a center for digital commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Welke says while he was working on funding for the e-commerce
center, the G7 summit of highly industrialized nations had met. The
world economic leaders were excited about electronic commerce. Out
of that conference came an organization called GCommNet _ the
Global Electronic Commerce Management network. Its goal was to
bring a number of universities around the world together to develop
e-commerce programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I had been a professor in Europe for a time, we became
rather directly involved in that entire process,'' Welke says.
``Two groups were formed, one was more technology-oriented from the
tech schools and the other was focused on the MBA side of things.''
</P>
<P>
   What emerged was a consortium of 10 of Europe's top business
schools, GSU and a university in Australia. Seven of the schools
will be offering digital commerce programs in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The program will kick off with students meeting in the
Netherlands at the Rotterdam School of Business. In 2001, the
one-week seminar will take place at GSU, and in 2002, students will
meet for a week at an Asian or Australian university to be
arranged. The rest of the coursework will be done at the GSU campus
with students remaining in constant touch with their international
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see technology as a driver not as an entity in itself. We
are interested in (students) who are going to reshape industry and
public policy.'' It's important to understand international laws,
regulations and regional restraints, Welke says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``You can't do drugstore.com in Germany. The
regulations won't permit it. Our perspectives are three-pronged.
The first is policy _ what can you do in the e-commerce space. It's
going to be controlled by national and international policy. It's
also about the movement of personal data.''
</P>
<P>
   The second prong is entrepreneurship. ``The focus is on what you
should be doing and how you should be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The third aspect is to teach students how to work within
national and international frameworks to develop e-commerce sites
that dovetail with the way the world does business.
</P>
<P>
   Welke acknowledges that it's hard to launch a program teaching
students to understand an industry that hasn't fully evolved. But
he believes the global nature of the GSU program should give
students a better framework for doing business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students will be people who understand the answers aren't
yet fully known,'' he says. ``Students need to have the mental
agility to go beyond the classroom and be enticed by the notion
that this is a new way of doing business.''

   AIRFORCE-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Air Force is taking flak
from federal investigators in two reports detailing waste and
mismanagment. One says that amid talk of more pay and bonuses to
keep pilots in the military, the Pentagon doesn't know how many
pilots it needs nor what it would take to retain them. Annother
says the Air Force's VIP wing, which flies the president and other
top officials, sometimes takes six years to send a bill _ if any is
sent at all. (Malone, Cox News Service)

   BUSH-AFFIRM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ When Texas Gov. George W. Bush
speaks of his views on affirmative action, opponents and supporters
of the concept applaud roundly. It seems as if Bush and his
``affirmative access'' stand has been able to strike a middle
ground in a divisive fight. But the phrase has confounded the media
and political stalwarts, who have accused Bush of being
intentionally vague _ if not dishonest _ on the issue. The rest of
the field of presidential candidates has defined views on the
subject. Democrats _ playing to their base _ support it, while
Republicans oppose it. Bush, meanwhile, is sticking to his guns.
And many political observers say he has good reason. Bush, they
say, has struck middle ground by rejecting polarizing positions.
``Affirmative access,'' they say, is a position acceptable to
conservatives while not alienating minorities. (Brooks, Austin
American-Statesman)

   GINGRICH _ ATLANTA _ Marianne Gingrich says her husband

   MUSLIM-PRISONERS _ FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ As the rest of the Muslim

Now, changes are in the works, said Sieg Christman, president of
Florida's Treasure Coast chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. After organization members met with St. Lucie County
sheriff's officials Friday, the jail has agreed to allow Ramadan
observance for the jail's eight Muslim inmates. It also has agreed
to allow a Jumu'ah prayer service once a month, officials said.
ACLU officials, who asked for weekly services on Friday, said
they're thankful, but that the accommodations aren't enough.

`IN TOO DEEP': A CONFLICTED DETECTIVE, A DRUG LORD NAMED GOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' is the story of an undercover police detective
who finds himself with conflicting loyalties, especially where the
matter of doing God's business is concerned. That's because God is
the blasphemous moniker of a Cincinnati drug lord played by the
rapper LL Cool J with impressive bluster.
</P>
<P>
   And it becomes increasingly impressive to Jeff Cole (Omar Epps),
who has adopted the alias J. Reid for his work at infiltrating
God's operation. The film means to be a semi-subtle look at the
conflicts in which Cole finds himself entangled.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the film treats its characters seriously and
doesn't resort to the obvious very often. And it was directed by
Michael Rymer, the Australian director whose ``Angel Baby,'' about
a desperate, fiery love affair, had a tragic intensity that this
film sometimes approaches. But ``In Too Deep'' has to make its
accommodations to the lurid genre of drug-dealer stories, and it
does so with more enthusiasm than absolutely necessary. God's cruel
streak is well documented long before he is seen torturing a naked,
disloyal subordinate with a pool cue.
</P>
<P>
   Epps plays his role with earnest conviction, so that not even
the obligatory romantic subplot (with Nia Long, as a model and
dancer living well outside the realm of Cole's police activities)
seems overly tacked on. But despite the fact that there is much for
him to say in the screenplay by Michael Henry Brown and Paul Aaron,
there is too much about Cole that goes unexpressed.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most delicate nuances are supplied by Ellery Ryan's
cinematography, which presents both the daylit world in which God
fancies himself a doting father and the color-infused realm of
crime. Within the characters themselves, the distinctions are
blurrier and less vivid.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `IN TOO DEEP'
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Rymer; written by Michael Henry Brown and
Paul Aaron; director of photography, Ellery Ryan; edited by Dany
Cooper; music by Christopher Young; production designer, Dan Leigh;
produced by Aaron and Brown; released by Dimension Films.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING TIME: 104 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   RATING: ``In Too Deep'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity,
nudity, sexual situations and some ugly violence.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Omar Epps (Jeff Cole/J. Reid), L L Cool J (Dwyane Gittens,
God) and Nia Long (Myra). &QL;

BY KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Q: I am a volunteer for a citizens group whose
dress code requires each male member to wear a coat and tie at all
formal functions. One of our members began wearing a T-shirt to the
formal meetings. Several of our members have asked him to respect
our dress code or resign, but he has done neither. His attitude is
that he doesn't care how he looks or what we think about it. Our
leader wants nothing to do with the problem and ignores it. How can
this issue be handled? R.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Just as participating in volunteer organizations is optional,
some people think that following the rules of these organizations
is optional as well. The attitude of these people is something
like: I'm a volunteer. If you don't like what I'm doing, that's too
bad. I can always volunteer somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the rules can also be a power play. This particular
volunteer may be trying to show everyone that he is above you and
the other volunteers, above the rules and so important that he can
do whatever he wants. However, when people get to choose which
rules they follow or ignore, there is no need for any rules.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem in this situation is the leader. In fact, the
indifference indicates that he or she is not a leader at all. You
and the other volunteers should meet with this person and present
some suggestions. In a word, either the rule should be followed or
abolished. If the organization is trying to project a particular
image at formal events and the T-shirted volunteer feels this image
is not for him, then perhaps the organization is not for him
either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was walking down the hall ahead of a few of my employees.
When I turned around, I saw one problem employee mimicking me in a
very derogatory way. I made an instant decision to avoid a
confrontation, so I ignored it. I'm fuming over what happened and
unsure if I did the right thing. S.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Wondering whether you did the right thing is not the right
thing to do. The fact is that, for better or worse, you let the
behavior slide. Rather than wondering about the past, it is time to
think about the future.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, problem employees should either become
solid employees or former employees. In the broadest sense, this
type of employee should be given specific guidance, feedback and
counseling, along with a clear understanding of the consequences
associated with inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While imitation may be the highest form of flattery, mimicking
may just as easily be the highest form of insult. As a result, if
you ever see that employee engaging in this type of behavior again,
or in any behavior that is designed to degrade, mock or ridicule
you, the next step is to call a meeting with the employee, discuss
the behavior and document it. If the employee continues to act out
against you, it is time for that employee to take the act on the
road _ and out of your company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have changed a core aspect of our hiring process. In the
past, we looked for people who had all of the training and
expertise needed for the job, and we did not put much emphasis on
personality, friendliness or cooperation. Now we are putting more
emphasis on those factors and less on the others. How does this
sound? F.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like you are going to build a productive,
cooperative and stable work force. Growing numbers of companies in
many sectors are placing major emphasis upon such factors as a job
candidate's social skills, communication skills, emotional maturity
and energy, while placing less emphasis on his or her expertise or
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying philosophy is that the technology needed for many
positions can be taught, while it is far more difficult to teach
someone how to be friendly, communicative, persistent, reliable or
caring. Related to this, companies have been finding that employees
are more likely to fail as a result of inability to get along with
others than inability to do the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   Screening for such factors in the hiring process can be
difficult. Obviously, it is essential to take a thorough work
history, use competency questions and take job references. Some
companies also use consulting firms to help. In doing so, it is
essential that their techniques be job-related and validated for
the particular firm.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, it makes sense to analyze your new
approach to see if it is really working and if the people hired
under it are really working.

 &HT;    A man with e-vision
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ravi Kalakota, Georgia State University's 32-year-old
Eminent Scholar, is a blend of personality, drive and interests
that make him a thoroughly modern man, Georgia style.
</P>
<P>
   Born in India, educated in India, Hawaii and Texas, he is fully
absorbed in his engrossing specialty _ the Internet and its power
to reshape business. Though he is concerned about the potentially
convulsive side-effects of the Internet on society and the
workplace, he has no doubts it can be a boon for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized as early as 1991, back in Texas, that Internet
communication was destined to change the world, not just
business,'' said Kalakota, ``and that is when I decided to make it
a focus of my study.'' He was 24 years old .
</P>
<P>
   Dean Sidney Harris of the J. Mack Robinson College of Business
said Kalakota has rare vision. ``His ability to comprehend and look
downstream at broad implications adds something very special to our
program at Georgia State. In so many ways he reminds me of Peter
Drucker, the management expert who was a colleague of mine, and it
is so surprising in one so young as he.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Worldwide Web was scarcely more than an idea,
Kalakota made it the subject of his doctoral dissertation in the
early 1990s. And then in 1994 on advice from his academic advisers
in Austin, at the age of 27, he drafted his first popular take on
this new phenomenon, an 800-page book, ``Frontiers of Electronic
Commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I embraced the idea that, to get ahead, I needed to try to
write a book that others would follow,'' said Kalakota.
</P>
<P>
   He followed up a year later with ``Manager's Guide to Electronic
Commerce.'' And now he has published his most encompassing work,
``e-Business: Roadmap for Success,'' which looks at electronic
commerce at the heart of a business plan, instead of a fancy
adjunct. Marcia Robinson is co-author.
</P>
<P>
   The essentially radical aspect of Kalakota's work is that he is
analyzing the huge change in commerce as it takes shape, not unlike
writing a geography book in the 16th century as explorers and
conquistadors made discoveries almost daily that modified the body
of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And so, though Columbus failed to find his way to the East
Indies, Kalakota of India has found his way to e-commerce, one of
the most compelling phenomena of Western industrial culture.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably young for his accomplishments, Kalakota did not touch
a computer until he was 17 and a student in junior college. `` My
interest in mathematics is what drove my initial interest in
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Math, science and computers have been his passion. But
communication, in broad terms, has been a consuming interest too.
He has won two awards for teaching excellence.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated with a degree in computer science in India in
1987 at 20, he made a beeline for the University of Hawaii for his
master's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaii did some of the earliest work on networks, as well as
packet-switching technology, and that's what attracted me. They
developed that technology, in part, as a matter of necessity, to
transmit large quantities of data among the Hawaiian Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he thought about working on a master's in business at
Harvard but decided instead to stay in computer science attending
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With degree in hand he turned to writing and consulting. Asked
if he planned to teach this year, Kalakota said no. ``Not teaching
in the ordinary sense. I teach executives. The things I have to say
need to be implemented or dismissed. They have little shelf life,
and so it is worth my time to talk to clients and others who can
make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   His first contract out of school was with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience is what taught me how difficult it is to get
major businesses to change and accommodate to the new technology of
the Internet,'' said Kalakota. ``It's like they are sailing along,
doing good business, and then somebody off-stage says they have to
lose weight. Lose weight! You are working hard, getting results,
headed fast in the direction of solving company problems and
meeting challenges, you have no spare time... you don't want to
hear lose weight or get involved in this e-commerce thing that you
don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Kalakota thinks hisexperience with AT&AMP;T, is instructive about
the problems of change. ``I spent eight months working with teams
of people within the company, trying to identify the products and
services that lend themselves to electronic commerce. Then Robert
Allen (former CEO) was out, and the slate was wiped clean, and the
idea of moving toward electronic commerce was changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If managers at the top do not push, no move toward electronic
commerce will occur,'' he said. ``Many managers are petrified of
this business, the unknown, and they are literally like deer in
headlights, blinded, scared but unable to move.'' In his book,
Kalakota writes
</P>
<P>
   ``e-Business is an alluring concept for most business
executives: buying and selling online, expanding the customer base;
improving customer loyalty, and interacting seamlessly and
efficiently with suppliers and business partners...
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers, however, need to look past the hype to realize that
e-business is bringing about fundamental changes...''
</P>
<P>
   The gist of his book is that e-commerce is substantially more
than a glamorous add-on. ''It reshapes the structure of entire
industries, creates niches for new sets of (intermediaries), and
enables businesses with well-executed business applications to take
quantum leaps forward, while those without them suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the traditional business might simply put up a Web
site with company information, perhaps selling a certain line of
goods on the Net, but otherwise conducts its business, marketing
and distribution in customary ways.
</P>
<P>
   An e-commerce savvy company might use its Web presence to order
basic materials, conduct marketing surveys, set up direct
distribution as close to the end user as possible, and be prepared
to switch sources of materials or distributors quickly. Kalakota
repeatedly stressed that the changed relationships between primary
businesses and their customers, ranging from households and
individuals to commercial and industrial customers, will wipe out
vast ``middle man'' enterprises, eliminating tens of thousands of
jobs and functions.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the change to electronic commerce is
occurring in fits and starts, faster among smaller, entrepreneurial
businesses, and more slowly among major businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Yankee Group, a Boston consultancy, found
that even among small to medium-sized companies, Web sites often
gave company information but did not allow customers to do business
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most surprising is how overall technology goals are
not in line with how these companies use the Internet, `` says
Michael Lauricella, a Yankee Group analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance has to do with fears of upsetting the tempo of
the company and its orientation to quarterly earnings expected by
investors, Kalakota said. It also has to do with the difficulty in
reorganizing internal investments, ``sometimes forcing you to
starve profitable activities and divert funds to something that is
basically unproven, from the manager's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But change they must, Kalakota said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that pressure makes change. Companies move toward
e-commerce to the extent they fear bankruptcy, or direct threats
from entrepreneurs who take aim at a share of their business. ``
</P>
<P>
   Asked who seems to be doing a good job, Kalakota said, without
hesitation, ``Lucent Technologies.'' Lucent, originally a part of
AT&AMP;T, was spun off and became an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freed from its bonds and allowed to make its own decisions,
the company has been able to marshal its considerable talent very
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Kalakota and his students and associates have put
together their own Website for an e-business, and it could well go
public in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Called hSupply.com, the site is designed to bring together the
hospitality industry and allied enterprises such as customers, and
suppliers of various consumables, such as soaps, detergents, towels
_ ``all the things that get used up by hotels, motels and other
similar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep your eye on us, and see if we know our stuff,'' said
Kalakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Research Alliance expects he does. ``Ravi Kalakota
is just what we seek in this program,'' said Mike Cassidy of
Alliance, which co-sponsors the Eminent Scholar program with the
colleges. He combines scholarship and the instincts for putting
ideas into practice, to develop the commercial side of things. He
was a real catch for us.''

ELF'S CHAIRMAN ASKS TOTAL FINA FOR NEW, LESS HOSTILE DEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Under criticism from at least some of his
institutional investors, the chairman of Elf Aquitaine SA pleaded
Tuesday for a peaceful deal in the takeover battle with the
French-Belgian oil company Total Fina SA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us agree to avoid polemics and personal attacks,'' said
Philippe Jaffre, Elf Aquitaine's chairman, as he presented his
company's half-year results in Paris Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself recognize merits in the Total Fina project, all the
while regretting the way in which it was presented and the
hostility surrounding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre's comments amounted to a plea for new negotiations in the
bitter fight that began when Total Fina mounted a $43 billion
hostile bid for Elf Aquitaine on July 5. Two weeks later, Jaffre
fired back with a counteroffer of $50 billion for Total Fina.
</P>
<P>
   But Elf Aquitaine is struggling for support. An American
advisory company, Institutional Shareholder Services, urged
investors last Friday to reject Elf's plan, partly because it would
have increased the company's indebtedness to $18.5 billion from
$3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too costly to existing shareholders,'' said Melanie Bich
Tran, a research analyst at the Rockville, Md.-based advisers, who
prepared the report on Elf Aquitaine's offer.
</P>
<P>
   French government officials have made clear that they would not
allow Elf Aquitaine to strike a deal with a foreign company. Given
the rapid pace of huge-scale mergers in the global energy industry,
Jaffre has acknowledged that a merger of some kind with Total Fina
is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The main strategic difference between the rival takeover offers
is that Total Fina would merge and retain the two companies'
chemical divisions. Elf Aquitaine would merge the chemical
operations but spin them off as a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, much of the fight is over which executives will
ultimately control the combined enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding his plea for peace, Jaffre accused the chairman
of Total Fina, Thierry Desmarest, of trying to muscle his way to a
takeover. ``For them, negotiations consisted of `Get out with your
hands in the air and we will spare no prisoners,''' Jaffre said in
an interview published Tuesday in the newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference to report the half-year results, he took
another swipe at Desmarest. Asked who he thought was best qualified
to run the merged company, Jaffre said his rival ``is an excellent
oilman'' who ``needs to complete his training.''
</P>
<P>
   Elf Aquitaine reported that net income more than doubled in the
first half of this year to 1.69 billion euros ($1.78 billion) from
699 million euros in the first half of 1998. Virtually all of that
was attributable to a one-time capital gain of a billion euros from
the merger of its Sanofi pharmaceutical division with that of
Synthelabo.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit declined in the first half, to 774 million
euros from 969 million. That reflected the slump in crude oil
prices and production before oil prices jumped this summer. The
results were still stronger than expectations, and Elf Aquitaine
shares rose 3.4 percent in Paris Tuesday, to 173.50 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre used the financial results to bolster his contention that
Total Fina's bid understated Elf Aquitaine's true value. He now
seems to be gearing up for extended bargaining. A Paris appeals
court ruled on Aug. 18 that Total Fina's offer should be extended
to mid-October _ a decision that gave Elf more time to round up
support from its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, the company announced it would postpone the
shareholders' meeting that had been called to approve a capital
increase. The meeting, scheduled for Sept. 3, will now take place
in mid-October.

investment money. Will it be in the comfort of mutual funds, or in
the riskier but sometimes more rewarding option of buying
individual stocks? (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   GSU-KALAKOTA _ ATLANTA _ Ravi Kalakota, Georgia State's Eminent
Scholar, is a man of intellect and here-and-now practicality. Not
content with high thoughts alone, he has produced a masterful
handbook on e-Business and already has his students embarked on a
business that could go public in months. His singular contribution
has been to distinguish electronic commerce, simply doing business
on the Web, from eBusiness, the art and science of changing a core
business plan to capitalize on the flexibility of superfast,
far-reaching communication now becoming possible. (Holsendolph,

   COXNET WHEELS 0824 _ At first glance, a compact truck with

some time and miles with Chevrolet's S-10 with those features, and
it all makes a lot of sense. (DeVault, Atlanta

   MONEYTALK _ Beginning investors have a number of choices to make
as they start building an investment plan. There are emotional
questions, particularly regarding how much volatility you can live
with. There are knowledge questions, involving how much you know
about investing and how much time you're willing to spend learning
more. Another square-one decision is where you'll put your
investment money. Will it be in the comfort of mutual funds, or in
the riskier but sometimes more rewarding option of buying
individual stocks? (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

AUTHOR CHINUA ACHEBE RETURNS TO NIGERIA AFTER 9-YEAR ABSENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ The Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe, whose 1958
novel ``Things Fall Apart'' has become one of the most popular
works of African fiction in the West, returned here Monday night
after a nine-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Achebe, 69, left Nigeria in 1990 to seek medical treatment in
the United States following a car accident that left him partially
paralyzed. The 69-year-old author did not make a statement on his
arrival at Lagos international airport with his family, according
to The Guardian, Nigeria's leading newspaper. Since then, he has
kept a low profile, and it is not clear whether he intends to stay
here permanently or to return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Achebe's visit comes three months after the inauguration of a
new civilian government and more than a year after the death of
Gen. Sani Abacha, whose repressive five-year rule drove many
Nigerians into exile. His arrival was seen as a positive
development in a country whose military rulers permitted little
criticism until last year and, in fact, became international
pariahs in 1995 after hanging the writer and political critic Ken
Saro-Wiwa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirms the fact that civilian rule is taking root,'' Gani
Fawehinmi, a prominent human rights lawyer in Lagos, said of
Achebe's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because Achebe was not regarded as an exile, his arrival
lacked the political symbolism of the return last year of Wole
Soyinka, the 1986 Nobel laureate for literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a literary milestone,'' said Mma Agbagha, a member of
the editorial board and a columnist for The Post-Express, a
newspaper based in Lagos. ``But he was never considered a very
political person, so as a political event it will not be as
significant as a literary one.''
</P>
<P>
   Achebe's novel ``Things Fall Apart'' deals with the effects of
colonialism on a Nigerian village in the early part of this
century; only one of his books, ``The Problem with Nigeria,'' was
an explicit attempt at describing the corruption and political
misrule that have bedeviled Nigeria since independence from Britain
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having had one of the most repressive military
governments in Africa, Nigeria has produced some of the continent's
greatest writers and boasts some its most vibrant newspapers and
magazines. Writers and journalists, who took the lead in
criticizing the country's military rulers, were often imprisoned in
recent years, and some died under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Abacha's death, his successor, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, came to the United States and met with
Soyinka, the Nobel laureate, as a sign of his sincerity in pressing
for political reform. Shortly after the meeting, Soyinka, who is as
famous here for his political defiance as for his writing, visited
Nigeria and has returned several times since then.

GERMANY'S MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR SETTLEMENT WITH SLAVE LABORERS
DELAYED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The German government and leading corporations here
have been obliged to abandon a Sept. 1 target date for a
multibillion-dollar settlement with slave laborers and others
forced to work by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The date, the 60th anniversary of Hitler's invasion of Poland
and the start of World War II, had considerable symbolic resonance
because many of the forced laborers were Polish. But officials
gathering Tuesday in Bonn for talks said the negotiations remained
mired in difficulties that would not be resolved by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still some way from arriving at a figure in terms of
the size of the payment, and the Sept. 1 date has become
unrealistic,'' said Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for the planned
fund to which many of Germany's largest corporations have said they
will contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the creation of the fund last February, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said payments should start ``very quickly, if
possible before Sept. 1, 1999,'' because of the advanced age of
many of the people concerned. The average age of the surviving
victims is believed to be about 80.
</P>
<P>
   But a dispute has hardened over the number of people who qualify
as ``forced laborers,'' and so over the amount of money that should
be paid. While the companies argue that the people concerned
probably number 500,000 to 800,000, lawyers for the victims have
put forward figures as high as 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the wide difference stemmed from the fact that
the companies _ which include DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank,
Siemens and Volkswagen _ contend that only those put to work by
private industry should be covered, while lawyers have suggested
that agricultural laborers and state employees should also be
compensated.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, initial German proposals that the fund should total
about $1.7 billion have been met with claims for as much as $11
billion, officials said. Otto Graf Lambsdorff, the chief German
negotiator, said Tuesday that the latter figure was ``far removed
from any realistic possibility'' and that any compromise figure
would be closer to the original offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff was joined in Bonn Tuesday by Stuart Eizenstat, the
deputy U.S. treasury secretary, officials from the 16 companies
ready to contribute to the fund, representatives of several central
and east European governments and of the Jewish Claims Conference,
and American and German class-action lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sticking point really is the numbers,'' said Alissa
Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the Jewish Claims Conference. ``Although
the talks have been going on since February, the sides are some way
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, the German government has paid
out about $80 billion in war reparations and aid, most of it to
Jews who survived concentration camps or fled. But forced laborers
_ generally non-Jews deported to Germany from central and eastern
European countries _ often have not been compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has a far smaller category of slave laborers, now estimated
to number between 100,000 and 200,000, who were put to work in
concentration camps. Many of these, but by no means all, were Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Gibowski said another important unresolved issue was that of the
assurances sought by German companies that, once the fund is
established, they will be immune from any further legal claims.
``Legal closure is critical,'' he said, ``and should be the subject
of an executive agreement between the German and American
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly global economy, and at a time when many major
German corporations have either made or are contemplating big
investments in the United States, this legal issue has become
critical. But although progress has been made toward an accord, the
issue remains outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do the questions of who would administer the fund in
the event that an agreement was reached, and whether the fund
should include payments for those Jews whose money or other assets
were ``Aryanized'' _ forcibly transferred to non-Jewish Germans _
during Hitler's rule and have not yet been compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials gathering for the three days of talks in Bonn
suggested the difficulties were such that an accord might still be
several months away. But with each month that passes, more of the
victims die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is aware that these are the final years,'' Ms. Kaplan
said.

CHINESE SET TO PROSECUTE LEADERS OF SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese authorities announced on Tuesday
that they were preparing to prosecute senior members of Falun Gong,
the spiritual movement that was banned last month after it startled
China's leaders with its ability to organize potent anti-government
protests.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver a strong message that Beijing will tolerate no
protests of any kind, the judicial authorities are now expected to
charge Falun Gong's leaders with subversion and direct that they be
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   An order jointly issued by the Communist Party's Central
Committee and China's Cabinet specified that core members of Falun
Gong must be punished severely, the official New China News Agency
reported on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by President Jiang Zemin, the campaign against Falun
Gong has provided a vehicle for a political crusade that seems
aimed at invigorating the Communist Party's authoritarian
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's strong embrace of Marxist ideology appears to
have renewed the political firepower of security and propaganda
operations, but it seems out of touch with popular concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the explosive role that mystical forces have played
in toppling weak authorities at transitional periods throughout
Chinese history, government leaders have conducted the campaign
against Falun Gong with marked thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what many Chinese analysts see as the campaign's overkill
has led them to question whether Jiang is pursuing his own
political objectives as well, using the campaign to extend his
authority at a time when he faces multiple challenges, notably with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order did not specify how many people would be
prosecuted. But more than 50 leaders are believed to be facing
harsh punishment for leading anti-government protests that the
authorities later described as an attempt to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Official efforts continue to blame the leaders of Falun Gong
while ordinary followers are pardoned and encouraged to disavow the
movement. The order said that only a ``tiny minority'' of Falun
Gong followers would be charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong-based human rights monitor said lawyers in Beijing
had been told to get official permission before taking on cases
involving Falun Gong members, and to report any instances of Falun
Gong members approaching them for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong mixes elements of Buddhism and Taoism with breathing
exercises and meditation. It also preaches frugality and abstinence
from liquor and tobacco as aids to leading a moral life.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned by wrenching changes in Chinese society, including
unemployment and growing corruption, millions of dispossessed
people yearning for spiritual fulfillment have been drawn to the
movement. Many are retired or unemployed workers who lost their
health benefits and believed Falun Gong's promise that illness
could be avoided or cured through meditation and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the movement by government skeptics provoked
numerous small protests in different parts of China in recent
years. But the movement came to the attention of China's top
leaders on April 25, when more than 10,000 followers surrounded
Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound in central Beijing, to demand
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   That event, expertly organized by Falun Gong leaders, so
frightened China's high officials that they later labeled it an
attempt to overthrow the government. When the authorities formally
banned Falun Gong on July 22, they accused the movement of
corrupting people's minds and sabotaging national stability.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Falun Gong followers were detained as the
government ordered a huge campaign that reached down to every
state-run workplace in the nation and has dominated the nation's
media for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   Although most detainees were let go and sent home within days,
the government has proceeded with a campaign of vilification of Li
Hongzhi, who founded the movement in 1992 and now lives in New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Falun Gong supporters in London said on Tuesday that Li had
abandoned plans to attend a movement gathering in Britain this
weekend. Although Britain did not agree to a request from China
that Li be blocked from entering the country, Li has told reporters
in New York that he fears assassination or kidnapping by the
Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   China issued an arrest warrant for Li last month and offered a
$10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. But Interpol
rejected a request from Beijing for help in apprehending Li, saying
the request was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Li has protested that his movement is apolitical and poses no
threat to social stability. But his credibility has been undermined
by his conflicting statements about his role in the April 25
protest, which China accuses him of masterminding.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Communist Party statement said it was necessary to
prosecute harshly anyone who ``plotted from behind the scenes and
deliberately sabotaged social stability.'' At the same time, it
encouraged leading members of the movement to admit their mistakes
and to expose the inner workings of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falun Gong leaders have insisted that the movement has
no formal organization, it was evident from the April 25 protest
that they could mobilize large groups of followers to act in a
disciplined and effective manner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order did not name any of Falun Gong's top leaders.
But those expected to receive the greatest punishment include Li
Chang, a former deputy director at the Ministry of Public Security,
and Wang Zhiwen, a former Railway Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed to discover that several senior military officers were
also Falun Gong followers, Chinese leaders have conducted a
crackdown in the army to root out any Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, the authorities also confiscated and
destroyed millions of books, cassette tapes and videos about Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order advised work teams to treat most Falun Gong
followers as victims who were unaware of the political goals and
motives of the movement's leaders. The same attitude will probably
extend to more than 1,000 government officials who were identified
during the first week of the crackdown as Falun Gong followers and
were detained in Communist Party schools and forced to renounce any
belief in the movement.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's announcement, the campaign is evidently in its
third and final stage.
</P>
<P>
   First the authorities outlawed the movement and accused it of
threatening social stability, illustrating their assertions with
testimony of former adherents who described how harmful it was,
saying it had caused some members to die from refusing medical
treatment and others to commit suicide in fits of delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the authorities expanded their campaign with accounts that
purported to show how Falun Gong was organized for political
purposes, with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the government.
</P>
<P>
   The final stage of the campaign is now expected to publicize the
punishment of the movement's leaders as an example to anyone
considering ways to challenge the authority of the Communist Party.
It is likely to be wrapped up in the coming weeks, before Oct. 1,
when the party is planning a huge celebration of its 50 years in
power.

 &HT;    AUDIT URGES CANCELATION OF FEDERAL GRANTS TO FOUR TENANT GROUPS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four Atlanta tenant organizations used federal
funds to write checks to ``cash,'' order an 800 phone line, and buy
excessive equipment, says a federal audit that recommends
terminating their grants.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the third to charge abuses in the Tenant
Opportunity Program in Atlanta, part of a five-year nationwide
effort to encourage residents to manage their own public housing
and gain job skills.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development's inspector general concluded that 31 Atlanta tenant
groups that had received $100,000 grants were incapable of managing
those funds. Federal officials hired consultants and decided to
keep most of the programs in operation, despite continuing findings
of misspent funds.
</P>
<P>
   The latest inspector general audit, issued earlier this month,
advised that the Housing Department cancel further funding to the
resident associations at McDaniel Glenn, Martin Luther King Senior
Highrise, Jonesboro North and Jonesboro South public housing
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Allen, Atlanta spokeswoman for the federal housing
department, said Tuesday the findings ``look very serious.'' She
said that the four associations would be invited to respond.
Termination of the grants could take as long as six months, Allen
said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, most of the current tenant self-help grants will have
already been phased out. However, the U.S. Housing Department has
developed a replacement program, Resident Opportunities and
Self-Sufficiency, to continue giving grants.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general audit of the four Atlanta associations
found that bookkeeping was lax or non-existent. Two of the
association's had spent large sums of money, with little to show
for the expenditures, the audit reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the King Senior Highrise, for example, the tenant group spent
$47,401, nearly half of its grant, but the auditors found that
progress reports ``did not indicate any significant
accomplishments.'' Jonesboro North's group spent $38,477 of its
grant ``but had not made any substantial progress'' in
accomplishing its goals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Three of the associations hired a contractor for job training
assistance, despite a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the approximately $130,000 in spending closely examined by
auditors, $38,000 was either ineligible for grant funding or
unsupported by documentation. For example the treasurer of one
group wrote three checks to ``cash,'' totalling $4,559. One group
paid more than $1,200 for three telephone lines, including one for
toll-free long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ One association had no bank statements, cash receipts or
disbursement records prior to August 1998, leaving $10,618
unaccounted for. ``The association president stated that the prior
president did not turn the books and records over to her,'' said
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The audit cited federal housing officials who directly oversee
the program but also assigned some of the blame to city housing
officials, who have an agreement to offer technical assistance to
the tenant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White, spokesman for the Atlanta Housing Authority,
protested that the city had no authority in these direct federal
loans. ``There was no accountability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a toothless tiger'' when it comes to the tenant
associations, he said. ``We're unable to control how they spend
their HUD grants.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy is not new to the tenant assistance program.
Congress held hearings in 1996, when it was discovered that members
of public housing tenant associations from around the country spent
$335,000 in federal money to attend a conference in Puerto Rico.

   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton made a televised address to
the nation about Kosovo last March 24, he uttered a sentence for
which he was belabored that day and every day for the next 10
weeks, until he finally declared victory on June 10: ``I do not
intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, with the outcome of the bombing campaign still in
serious doubt, the president sharply altered course with the
comment: ``I don't think we or our allies should take any options
off the table, and that has been my position from the beginning,''
which of course it had not.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
known as Sandy, who wrote the initial offending sentence. Both he
and his boss saw fairly quickly that it was a mistake, because they
realized that having plunged into the conflict with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, there was no acceptable alternative
to a NATO victory. If ground troops were needed to get the Serbian
tanks out of Kosovo, then ground troops it would have to be.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may well have held out longer than he otherwise would
have because he believed that he faced no danger of land combat,
and he certainly gained time to savage ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
and drive them out. Berger told a friend as early as April that he
should have put in something about leaving all options on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   He did not do so, Berger said a few days after the bombing had
stopped, because ``the American people would not have supported the
war without European participation, and we never could have gotten
all 19 allies on board at the outset if they thought we had any
plan to use ground forces.'' In keeping with that view, Clinton cut
his rhetorical cloth to fit the politics of both NATO and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of criticism crossed party and ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, accused
the administration of indulging in ``a new technological racism''
based on the premise that the life of ``one American serviceman was
not worth risking in order to save the lives of thousands of
Kosovars.'' The Economist headlined an editorial, ``A Bungled
War.'' Michael Kelly, a columnist, suggested that a ham and cheese
sandwich could run foreign policy better than Berger and his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's place at the nexus of Kosovo strategy was no surprise,
nor was his concentration on its political aspects. Widely regarded
as the president's closest foreign policy aide, perhaps the most
influential national security adviser since Henry Kissinger, he is
at bottom a political rather than strategic figure. Unlike the
professors, diplomats and military officers who have for the most
part preceded him in his job, he made his way to the White House by
way of the salons and back rooms of Democratic politics while
pursuing a public career as a trade lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the lawyer's inherent caution,'' said John Dyson, a New
York investor and political operative who has known Berger since
college. ``The craft is a tactical craft. You focus on the
downside, always worrying about avoiding negative results.''
</P>
<P>
   Beefy and chubby-cheeked at 53, serious and formal in dark suits
and white shirts, Berger makes a sharp contrast to his elfin
predecessor, Anthony Lake, whom he served as a deputy during
Clinton's first term. Lake wore professorial tweeds. He was so
seldom seen in public that friends called him ``the submarine.''
But Berger's is a familiar face on television and on Capitol Hill,
where he has built strong links to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Style: A 15-Hour Day And a Modest Ego
</P>
<P>
   In the first term, Lake and the other main foreign-policy
figures were older than Clinton. Now they are contemporaries.
Berger, who has known Clinton since the McGovern presidential
campaign of 1972, helped him in small but important ways at low
points in his career. He has a closer relationship to the president
than Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is better at
formulating policies than in selling them to Clinton, or Defense
Secretary William Cohen, a Republican who spent the first Clinton
term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to find anyone who knows him who does not like
Berger personally. His ego is of normal dimensions. He buys his
reading glasses at the drug store. In a city where backbiting is
the preferred contact sport, he is widely considered a gentleman.
In a culture of 12-hour-days, he regularly puts in Stakhanovite
stints of 15 and 16 hours, fueled by endless glasses of iced
coffee, which he took to drinking when he gave up smoking.
Colleagues worry that he might fall victim to the same tensions as
Leon Fuerth, Vice President Al Gore's foreign-policy counselor, who
suffered a heart attack last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger gets very mixed reviews as a security adviser from
those outside his immediate circle. A European ambassador said he
lacked ``the indispensable ability to see around corners, to
anticipate events and to see how one problem relates to another.''
A friend and sometime administration colleague said Berger lacked
strategic vision but ``wants to be accepted as a kind of Sandy
Kissinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger himself commented rather condescendingly, ``you can't
expect a trade lawyer to be a global strategist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, Clinton's former political guru, wrote recently
that ``there are hundreds of members of the Council on Foreign
Relations who know more about foreign policy than Berger,'' but he
added that Berger was ``just right'' for the president's concept of
foreign policy which, he said, centers on domestic political and
economic considerations, not on strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense Berger's friends note that while Clinton's
attention to events abroad is normally intermittent, the president
was especially distracted for almost two years by the Lewinsky
matter. One retired American diplomat blamed ``a disastrous Balkan
policy, in which every aspect has been treated incrementally,''
mostly on the president.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Berger has to deal with a world seismically remade by
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a new framework for American foreign policy,''
said Harry McPherson, a Texan who worked in the Johnson White House
and has closely watched all administrations that followed. ``Well,
great. But who has produced one? Sandy's a carpenter, not an
architect, like everyone else these days. He's a good one, and that
may be the best we can hope for now.''
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out in Kosovo, Milosevic buckled under the
pressure of bombardment. But it was ``an exceptionally close-run
thing,'' a senior administration official said, with talks about
peace terms taking place at the same time as discussions about
sending in the troops if no agreement was reached by the end of
June. And the allies were unable, in the end, to prevent the
slaughter of many of the Kosovo Albanians they had acted to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said ``the president truly believed, as I believed and no
more than three other people in America did, that air power would
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is not yet clear that the war has been won. It is not
clear how many ethnic Albanians will ultimately be able to rebuild
their lives, or how successful the NATO alliance will be at
achieving the multiethnic society it says it wants for Kosovo.
There is little prospect of stabilizing the Balkans, an important
goal of American policy, without a stable Serbia. Yet that country
is in ruins, Milosevic remains in office and Clinton has vowed to
give only minimal rebuilding aid as long as he clings to power.
</P>
<P>
   The Bio: Small-Town Kid, Solid Democrat
</P>
<P>
   Berger grew up in Millerton, N.Y., a then-isolated rural
community of 900 people in the dairy country northeast of
Poughkeepsie. His father died when he was only 8, and his mother
ran a struggling Army-Navy surplus store. From his mother, he
inherited the habit of hard work and a love of order; he still
makes lists each Sunday, in his immaculate handwriting, of things
to be done the following week.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers stood apart from the Millerton mainstream, as
Democrats in a town where ``people gave parties when F.D.R. died,''
and as Jews in the WASP heartland. Berger took his religious
training from a rabbi in a nearby hospital for the mentally
retarded. Young Sandy Berger had another distinguishing feature: He
was a fervent Dodger fan in a Yankee town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I grew up is very important to what I am,'' he said.
``My perspectives are still more Millerton 1960 than Washington
2000. The small-town sense of community and social responsibility _
that's the lasting imprint of Millerton on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger likes to tell about visiting an aunt in Brooklyn when he
was 10 and sleeping fitfully all night because of the fire and
police sirens. When he asked her about them, she answered, ``Oh,
you get used to it.'' But when a siren sounded in Millerton, he
said, ``You knew that you'd know the people whose house was on
fire, so you never got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell University, his good nature and his organizational
ability led him into student politics. As head of the
interfraternity council, he came under the sway of an assistant
dean, Albert Miles, who got him interested in questions of social
justice. He asked civil rights leaders like Stokely Carmichael to
Cornell to speak, he fought discrimination in the fraternities,
closing down one that barred blacks from a party, and he persuaded
James Perkins, the university president, to fly to Cornell a group
of black schoolchildren from Brooklyn who had created a a black
history project that no one had come to see. The project was
displayed at the Student Union.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Cornell, where he met his wife, Susan, with whom he has
lived in the same unpretentious house for 26 years, Berger
encountered an important intellectual mentor, George McT. Kahin, a
historian of Southeast Asia. He took the course on Vietnam taught
by Professor Kahin, whose books became the testaments of the
anti-war movement. Berger's opposition to the war derived from that
course, he says today, as does his habit of ``questioning
everything that I read.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never marched against the war, preferring, as he put it,
to work within the system, first as a summer intern in Washington
for Rep. Joseph Resnick, a millionaire television-antenna
manufacturer from the Catskills. At Harvard Law School, Berger
volunteered first for Eugene McCarthy, then for Robert F. Kennedy,
displaying the kind of pragmatism that sometimes gets him in
trouble in his present job with more ideologically rigorous types.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, on the dovish McGovern campaign, he met a man
wearing a Colonel Sanders white suit, Bill Clinton, and the two
quickly became buddies. McGovern's ignominious defeat is regarded
by most politicians as an instructive example of what happens when
a candidate totally loses touch with an electorate, but Berger
views him as an ``inspiring'' leader, describing the 1972 fiasco as
the result of tactical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The dovish theme continued at Hogan &AMP; Hartson, one of
Washington's premier law firms, where Berger, who represented
Japanese and other clients, talked often with the firm's most
eminent figure, former Sen. J. William Fulbright, the godfather of
the anti-war movement. When he went into the State Department in
the Carter administration, he fought in the trenches alongside the
dovish secretary, Cyrus Vance, against the more hawkish national
security adviser, Brzezinski, and resolved to do all he could to
avoid such fights if he ever found himself in a position of real
power.
</P>
<P>
   However much he may have hated the Vietnam War, Berger is, along
with most of his peers, in essence a consensus-seeker and a
deal-cutter, and work as a trade lawyer strengthened those
tendencies. His contacts with Asia gave him a profound belief in
free trade as a means of knitting the world together _ a view that
would color his subsequent attitudes toward China, the issue on
which he has probably spent more time than any other in the White
House.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The White House: A Friend of Bill's Who Never Left
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Carter administration, the years from 1968 to
1992 were Republican years, but Berger found ways to keep a
political oar in. He formed an important alliance with Pamela
Harriman, the Washington social doyenne, writing speeches for her
to give her the cloak of political gravitas she longed for, and
benefiting, in turn, from her wealth and connections.
</P>
<P>
   One button on Mrs. Harriman's telephone in her elegant
Georgetown residence was marked ``Sandy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton lost a re-election bid as Arkansas governor in
1980, Berger persuaded Mrs. Harriman to put the young ex-governor
on the board of her political action committee, which came to be a
major fund-raising arm of the Democratic Party. That gave Clinton a
reason to come to Washington to schmooze. Eight years later, when
Clinton muffed a big chance, delivering an agonizingly boring
speech at the party convention in Atlanta, the Berger-Harriman team
stepped in again, organizing a midnight dinner to pick up the
Clintons' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ran in 1992, Berger joined him as a senior
foreign-policy adviser. When Clinton won, Berger helped persuade
him to send Mrs. Harriman to Paris as ambassador. Berger was
offered the national security adviser's job but demurred on the
grounds of limited experience, suggesting Tony Lake instead. Berger
became Lake's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   But during Clinton's first term, says a person who held a senior
position during that period, ``everyone with a problem in the
security area went to Sandy _ honest, helpful, Sandy, who never
lied _ and he built up a tremendous amount of credibility that
helped him enormously once he took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has worked hard to maintain his network, talking by
telephone as many as a dozen times a day with Albright, meeting
once a week for breakfast with her and other security
``principals'' such as CIA Director George J. Tenet, and visiting
the Hill often.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials in the State Department and the Defense
Department praise Berger's trustworthiness and his ability to run
meetings, though some of the generals and admirals are not entirely
comfortable with him or any of the old anti-war crowd and their
brand of cautious interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds of friendship between Clinton and Berger _ one of the
few who has served the entire two terms at the White House under
four chiefs of staff _ have held, even in bad times, such as the
town meeting on Iraq in Columbus, Ohio, in May of last year, which
ended with Cohen and Albright being shouted down. Berger himself
describes the event as ``a complete fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any sign that Berger's standing with the president
has slipped because of the administration's difficulties with
China, the country with which he is most closely identified. It is
the country whose development, he once said, ``will have the
biggest impact on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   To shape that development, Berger has championed a policy of
engagement, in which the United States has tried to bind China to
the United States through economic and security arrangements. But a
lot of things have gone wrong lately, from illicit Chinese campaign
contributions to the Democrats to the accidental bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's biggest setback on the China front came in April when
he was unable to persuade Clinton to sign a trade deal during Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the White House. Despite his clout
with Clinton, he was outflanked on this occasion by John S.
Podesta, the White House chief of staff. Podesta had the foresight
to win the backing of a man even more influential than Berger,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and they persuaded the president
to hold out for more concessions to placate Congress. Despite
efforts to regroup, no treaty has been signed yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for Berger personally were charges that he reacted
too passively when told about the suspected Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets. He insists that he acted properly when told of the
charges, even though he was late in briefing Clinton, waiting until
after March of this year, on detailed charges that Berger had
learned in July 1997. When asked if he felt whether he had dropped
the ball in any way, either in terms of substance or in terms of
appearances, Berger replied, cold-eyed, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's cherished reputation on the Hill has nonetheless taken
a hit, with several influential members of Congress calling for his
resignation. These calls have subsided, but he remains ``very
exposed and very vulnerable on this,'' according to a government
China specialist who admires him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best link we have with China,'' the specialist said.
``But he is viewed by our critics as someone who cares more about
China than the United States, and that limits his ability to take
initiatives with China. You need to explain the bombing, but you
can't send Sandy to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an inescapable sense that the Administration makes
policy on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the former White House press secretary,
concedes that ``we don't have a new definition of the U.S. role in
the world yet.'' In some moods, Berger sounds as if that's fine
with him. In 1991, he said during a panel discussion that most
``grand strategies'' were after-the-fact rationales developed to
explain successful ad hoc decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation, Berger said that he prefers to ``worry
about today today and tomorrow tomorrow.''

IN AMERICA: HAVE PIANO, WILL TRAVEL (TO VERY SMALL TOWNS)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Austria, Nev., Md., Wash., Calif., Texas, Mich., N.H.)  ARTS (dw) 
 By MARTIN FORSTENZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHOP, Calif. _ Classical music concerts are rarer than summer
rainstorms in this isolated high desert town a few hundred miles
north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a ripple of excitement in the audience of about 250
in the gymnasium of the town's Calvary Baptist Church when Laura
Spitzer strode out beneath the basketball hoop, seated herself at a
grand piano placed before the waiting Eastern Sierra Symphony
Orchestra and began Grieg's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in A
minor. Playing in such a remote rural town is nothing new for Ms.
Spitzer, who has made a career of performing classical music far
off the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old pianist, who studied music at the Mozarteum
University in Salzburg, Austria, and the Peabody Institute at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, has spent almost two decades
traveling across the United States and Canada, usually toting along
a seven-foot Steinway grand piano in her Ford van, playing in small
towns like Chewelah, Wash., or Pioche, Nev. (population 924).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitzer, a native of Syracuse who now makes her home in Van
Nuys, Calif., has played solo classical piano concerts in small
cities and tiny backwaters in almost every state in the West and
others in the Midwest and East, trundling her piano as far from
home as Plymouth, N.H. She has also given more than a thousand
music programs for children, playing in schools across the United
States and Canada and teaching young people about classical music.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist has performed in large concert halls in the United
States and Europe, but she said she played solo recitals in rural
towns not only to spread a greater appreciation of classical music
beyond the big cities, but also to make a living, although a modest
one, performing the classics. ``I wanted to know it was possible,''
she said. ``For me, it was a test of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Her appearances in small towns have not exactly been glamorous.
In addition to performing in gymnasiums, churches, museums and
school auditoriums, she has played Chopin, Debussy, Mozart and
Ravel in retail stores, a train depot, a converted auto garage. Her
performance in Pearsall, Tex., was announced on the marquee of one
of the town's fast-food chicken franchises, and in Norway, on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, she was sponsored by the local Dairy
Queen. She has also played solo concerts in housing projects,
hospitals and youth halls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ms. Spitzer has developed a singular performance
style. She began introducing pieces with colorful stories about how
they were written, perhaps throwing in a few jokes, more like a
folk musician or a cabaret performer. During intermissions, she is
likely to mingle with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitzer is a performer with a dramatic flair. ``She plays
convincingly in a great many styles,'' said Marienne Uszler, editor
of Piano and Keyboard magazine and emeritus professor of keyboard
studies at the University of Southern California. ``She has a very
highly developed technique. Technically she can do an enormous
amount of things, and she is a very colorful player.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist started on her unusual career after she moved to Las
Vegas in 1979 to be with the man she later married, and wanted to
find a way to make a living in the area as a classical pianist.
After playing sporadic engagements that did not bring in much
income, she received the first of four grants from the Nevada State
Council on the Arts to give piano recitals in small towns across
the state. She has now played in 50 of them, in Nevada alone, she
estimated, and has received the state's Governor's Arts Award.
</P>
<P>
   She began hauling her own Steinway, which weighs almost 1,000
pounds, because in the small towns ``there weren't any
concert-worthy grand pianos,'' she said. ``I would call these towns
and say, `What have you got to play on?' and they would say, `An
old upright in the elementary school that's been played on for 50
years and was tuned in, um ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitzer's first road concert, in the early 1980s, was in
Panaca, Nev., a town of fewer than 600 people. ``The day that I got
there, there was a blizzard,'' she said. ``Yet 200 people showed
up, a full house. There is very little that goes on those towns.
They were starved.''
</P>
<P>
   The wandering musician said one of her strangest experiences was
performing in Caliente, Nev. She had set up to play on the steps of
an old railway depot. ``They had a pig wrestling contest across the
street,'' she said. ``People would come with their boots all
mud-splattered from the pigs, and they'd just sit down and listen
to a classical piano concert. As I was starting the story about the
`Rhapsody in Blue,' a 92-car westbound freight train barreled by
and just stopped the concert.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when she first started touring rural areas she was
surprised by the response. ``I didn't think people cared about
classical music. I didn't think people would show up.''
</P>
<P>
   But people came for the recitals and often seemed unexpectedly
moved. ``Truck drivers in cowboy hats would come up with tears in
their eyes,'' Ms. Spitzer said. ``It made me feel like there was a
reason to do what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the pianist has settled down a bit,
spending most of her time working on a doctorate at the University
of Southern California and performing only in California. Last
year, Ms. Spitzer, who is now divorced, also went to Guangzhou,
China, and adopted a daughter, Anna. She still drives hundreds of
miles for appearances, sometimes taking the child, who is 2{, with
her. She plans to resume wider travels after she receives her
doctorate next year.

EX-PREMIERS JOINING PARTIES TO OPPOSE YELTSIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For aspiring politicians in Russia, getting sacked by
President Boris N. Yeltsin looks increasingly like a great career
move.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for the second time in as many weeks, one of Yeltsin's
recently jilted prime minister's joined an electoral alliance that
turned Moscow's chatty political class on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   This time it is Sergei Stepashin, who served as premier for just
82 days before being fired by Russia's mercurial and increasingly
capricious president, who was at the center of attention. In a
surprise move late Tuesday night, Stepashin announced that he was
joining forces with Russia's main liberal opposition party, Grigory
Yavlinsky's Yabloko.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very fortunate alliance for both Yabloko and
Stepashin,'' said Moscow-based political analyst Andrei
Piontkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   After being fired by Yeltsin on Aug. 9, Stepashin has watched
his public approval ratings rise _ something that has become a bit
of a trend for ex-premiers lately. According to polls released over
the weekend, Stepashin is now Russia's second most trusted
politician _ behind another ex-prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov,
who was abruptly canned by Yeltsin in May.
</P>
<P>
   And while last week it was Primakov _ by far the counntry's most
popular public figure _ who made waves by forming an anti-Kremlin
political bloc with Moscow's ambitious Mayor Yury Luzhkov, Tuesday
it was Stepashin's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sacked, Stepashin was considered by many pundits
here to be Yeltsin's hand-picked successor. The fact that he has
joined forces with a staunch Kremlin critic like Yavlinsky shows
just how isolated the deeply unpopular Yeltsin and his inner circle
have become.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin had been heavily courted by various political parties,
including Luzhkov's Fatherland-All Russia and a fledgling liberal
coalition that three of Yeltsin's other fired prime ministers _
Yegor Gaidar, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko _ were
trying to piece together.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing Yavlinsky's Yabloko _ which means ``apple'' in
Russian _ analysts say Stepashin has made the best possible choice.
A widely respected economist, the prickly and principled Yavlinsky
has refused several invitations to join Yeltsin's cabinet, saying
he wants nothing to do with what he calls a corrupt oligarchic
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky's attitude drawns criticism in some quarters, where he
is accused of being unconstructive perpetual opposition figure. But
it has also won him a reputation with cynical voters as something
that many in this vast country have long considered to be an
endangered species _ an honest politician.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko, which won 7 percent of the vote in parliamentary
elections four years ago, is the only democratic party in Russia
that is not associated in the public mind with the rampant cronyism
and corruption of the Yeltsin years. With Stepashin on board,
analysts say the party will win many more votes when Russians go to
the polls to choose a new parliament in December.
</P>
<P>
   And by hooking up with the squeaky clean Yavlinsky, Stepashin _
who recently told a Moscow newspaper that he was fired as prime
minister because he ``couldn't be bought'' _ will give his own
image a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Stepashin, Yabloko will be able to realistically compete
with the Communists and Fatherland for the most seats in the
Duma,'' said Piontkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Stepashin and Yavlinsky pledged to work
together to form either ``an honest and effective democratic
government or a honest and effective law-abiding opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin will run for parliament from his hometown St.
Petersburg, in a district formerly represented by Galina
Starovoitova, a friend and political ally who was assassinated last
year. Stepashin said that he felt it his ``moral duty'' to
Starovoitova to win the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin and Yavlinsky also agreed to work as a team in the
presidential elections scheduled for next summer. Yavlinsky, who
finished fourth in Russia's 1996 presidential poll, has already
announced his intention to run in 2000. But given the new alliance
with Stepashin, also widely considered a presidential hopeful, it
is not clear who will be Yabloko's candidate.

DISNEY UNIT BUYING INTO WEB RETAILER OF EDU-TOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A division of the Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday that it plans to
purchase a majority stake in toysmart.com, a e-commerce retailer of
educational toys.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com aims to be the dominant e-commerce player in
educational toys, and the partnership with the Buena Vista Internet
Group, which operates Disneystore.com and ESPNstore.com, among
other Web initiatives, should help it to achieve that goal quickly,
said toysmart.com chief executive David Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for toysmart,'' said Forrester Research
analyst David Cooperstein. ``It gives them distribution they could
only dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a downside to being part of Disney's Mickey
Mouse empire _ a loss of autonomy if sales targets aren't met.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have to beware,'' Cooperstein said of toysmart. ``The
mouse that roars can eat everything in its path.''
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista operates many Web sites, including Family.com, which
offers advice on parenting.
</P>
<P>
   With toysmart, Buena Vista can marry such ``content sites'' as
Family.com with one devoted to selling products that are ideal for
consumers who visit Family.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first stage of a transformation of a
family-content site for parenting being tied in with the best
e-commerce for families,'' said Chuck Davis, Buena Vista's
president of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista declined to say how large a stake it bought in
toysmart.com and how much it paid for it, but industry sources
pegged the investment at between $40 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for Buena Vista to fill three of the five seats on
toysmart's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart could see part of Buena Vista's investment come in the
form of promotional considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is somewhat open-ended,'' Davis said. ``But when
Disney puts its synergy machine in motion, toysmart will get reach
both on-line and off-line.''
</P>
<P>
   A privately held company, toysmart.com does not disclose
financial information, including revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com grew out of the Internet component of Holt Co., a
school supply business. Late last year, Lord, then Holt's chief
executive, bought the Web-site toy business from family-owned Holt
and dubbed it toysmart.com. Its headquarters is in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What eToys is to Barbie and G.I. Joe, toysmart.com wants to be
for so-called ``good toys'' such as a miniature solar-powered
windmill from K'Nex, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In the brick-and-mortar world, mainstream toys are dominated by
such retailers as Toys 'R Us and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., but the
retail category for specialty toys is highly fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   Fragmented retail catergories can be ripe for e-commerce, said
analyst Cooperstein. The Internet is a great vehicle for products
that are under-marketed and hard to find, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lord, specialty toys account for nearly 40 percent
of sales for the $25 billion US toy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart already had planned a $20 million advertising campaign
to drive holiday sales; with the Disney publicity machine now
behind it, holiday expectations are even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for toysmart to add Disney toys to its product mix
and also to expand into baby products and children's furniture.
</P>
<P>
   For a company that promotes a philosophy of selling only
educational and nurturing toys, adding too many Disney toys to the
product mix could pose a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mission could get diluted if there are too many Disney
products'' on toysmart's Web site, Cooperstein said.

FED TIGHTENS DOWN ON INFLATION THREAT WITH RATE HIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board for a second time this summer bumped
interest rates up by a quarter percentage point in an attempt to
head off inflation caused by galloping growth.
</P>
<P>
   In an action that was widely expected, the Fed committee headed
by chairman Alan Greenspan which sets monetary policy, voted to
raise the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 5.25 percent.
But, in a mildly surprising signal of the committee's vigilance in
pre-empting inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee also
raised another key interest rate, the discount rate, by a quarter
point, to 4 3/4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The moves had virtually no impact on the bond or stock markets,
which widely anticipated them. But, the Fed's action will increase
the cost of borrowing and buying for Americans whose spending has
fueled the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best news for consumers because bank loans such
as mortgages are going to be rising, but the long-term view is the
Fed is vigilant on inflation and that's good for consumers in the
long run,'' said Mario DeRose, fixed-income strategist for Edward
Jones, a St. Louis brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The tightening move came just eight weeks after the Fed
committee boosted the federal funds rate to 5 percent, from 4.75,
at its last meeting on June 30. Although the Fed at that time said
no further hikes were planned, data that showed wages were
accelerating forced Greenspan and other board members to rethink
that stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed seemed firm that Tuesday's rate hike would be sufficient
and again adopted a neutral position on the future direction of
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said in a statement after concluding its meeting:
``Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the
policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally
in US financial markets over recent months, should markedly
diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Two consecutive rate hikes _ the first on June 30 _ took back
most of the three separate, quarter-point reductions last fall in
the midst of financial crises abroad and on Wall Street. The
reversals mimicked moves not seen since the Fed undid its emergency
easing in the face of the stock market crash of October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the Fed announcement held little news, save
raising the discount rate and closing a widening gap with the
federal funds rate. The discount rate is the amount commercial
banks are charged to borrow money from the central bank; the
federal funds rate is the rate at which banks are required to
charge when lending overnight to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan hit the ball right down the center of the
fairway. He did what was the mainstream expectation, which was to
raise rates 25 basis points and to adopt a neutral directive,''
said Richard Hoey, chief economist in the New York office of mutual
fund manager Dreyfus Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets shrugged. Dow Jones industrial stock index,
which soared 199 points on Monday to a new record, surged Tuesday
and then plunged in a confused reaction to the Fed announcement.
The Dow closed Tuesday at 11,283.30, off just 16.46 points _ an
insigificant percent change.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 3.28 points, up
one-quarter of a percentage point, while the technology-heavy
Nasdaq rose 32.80 points, up 1.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has correctly anticipated the Fed moves, and it
more or less discounted this action in the market'' prior to
Tuesday's announcement, said Stephen Oristaglio, &UR;  &LR; deputy head of
investments for Putnam Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Greenspan had carefully prepared a nervous stock
market trading at sky-high levels. Most recently in July 21
testimony to Congress, he warned that inflationary forces were
rising, especially due to a very tight labor market which has shown
signs of pushing up wages, the largest single cost faced by
producers and are a key determinant of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Although wage pressures haven't yet shown up in the consumer
price index, which is rising at only a 1.7 percent pace this year _
one of the best showings this decade _ the Fed's actions were
clearly meant to pre-empt harsher measures in the future and ensure
a soft landing for an economy forecast to gain speed later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group Inc.,
cited a number of factors worrying the Fed. In addition to a tight
labor market caused by low unemployment, they include acclerating
growth and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   After expanding 4.3 percent in the first three months of this
year, economy in the second quarter slowed to 2.3 percent, though a
revised growth estimate, due on Thursday, may show even slower
growth. But growth is expected to pick up in the second quarter as
businesses restock inventories that were unusually low in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``With financial markets functioning more normally, and with
persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming
and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease
required to address the global financial market turmoil of last
fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary,
economic expansion,'' the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Fed's moves are in part trying to catch up to the
bond market where yields on long-term bonds have risen sharply. The
yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds are a full percentage point
higher than they were in January, though still slightly below
levels a year ago. The yield fell 5 basis points Tuesday to 5.93
percent, the lowest level since July 21.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate _ at 5.25 percent _ is still below the
5.5 percent level before a series of three easings last year.

Phoenix since the candiate declared last winter. Keyes, an
articulate Black conservative who main issue is abortion, himself

FILENE'S BASEMENT GETS OK ON $135M CREDIT LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A day after filing for Chapter 11 protection, Filene's
Basement Corp. has received interim approval from the US Bankruptcy
Court for a special credit line that should help get more
merchandise into its stores.
</P>
<P>
   With $135 million in debtor-in-possession financing, Filene's
Basement now looks to clear the first hurdle on its comeback trail
_ convincing vendors to resume shipments of goods to its stores
without insisting on upfront payments.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid they wouldn't be paid, vendors stopped shipping
merchandise in the last month. That forced the Boston retail legend
to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The credit line granted to the company Tuesday should ease
short-term cash-flow problems.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for Filene's Basement chairman Sam Gerson to visit
New York in an effort to win back the support of the chain's
vendors, the company's public relations firm said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the credit line that was approved for Filene's
Basement Tuesday should allay vendors' concerns, but it doesn't
always work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will vendors open their credit lines? That's the first
hurdle,'' said Stuart Hirschfield, chairman of the bankruptcy group
at Dewey Ballantine LLP, the New York law firm that helped Bradlees
Inc. navigate Chapter 11. ``You're going to know that within the
first 30 to 60 days. If you can't get over that hurdle, you can
really strain your cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one vendor said it was willing to resume shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd certainly ship to them again,'' said Morty Holtzman, a
principal in Harve Bernard Ltd. of New York, which has supplied
Filene's Basement with coats and sportswear for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed in US Bankruptcy Court in Boston,
Filene's Basement owes Harve Bernard about $470,000.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman said he is impressed by Filene's Basement's new Aisle 3
chain of warehouse stores that open only on weekends, though he
frets the company may have launched Aisle 3 too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gut feeling is that Aisle 3 is a home run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement operates four Aisle 3 stores, and another four
are set to open shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its famous flagship store at Downtown Crossing in
Boston, the company operates 50 stores under the Filene's Basement
name. It's likely that the company will close some stores, but it's
too early to predict which ones and how many.
</P>
<P>
   While the flagship thrives, many of these other stores are
thought to be the root of the company's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman said Filene's Basement has made some poor real estate
decisions. To maximize profits, a store that charges low prices
should be in a low-rent location, but some of the company's
secondary stores are in high-rent districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another firm owed money by Filene's Basement also seems to be
rooting for its survival.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Media Inc. is a Natick, Mass. firm hired by Filene's
Basement to buy air time for its radio and television ads.
According to its court filing, Filene's Basement owes Pro Media
about $522,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to continue to do business with them,'' said Les
Greenberg, Pro Media's chief financial officer. ``Hopefully, it
will go on as business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Chapter 11 seemed a safer haven than it may be
today. A retailer's creditors often had a vested interest in the
survival of a good customer of their goods and services, and
creditors often stuck by the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, however, it has become an increasingly
common practice for creditors to sell their claims to funds that
specialize in distressed investments, said attorney Hirshfield.
</P>
<P>
   These funds may care little for a retailer's survival. If a
quick buck can be made from liquidation, these funds may try to
pressure a retailer to go out of business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the producers of the loopy comedy ``South
Park'' were to make a medical drama, it might go something like
this:
</P>
<P>
   An attractive female surgeon, heading to work on her first day
at a major hospital, cheerfully asks a woman on the street for
directions but is warned: ``Oh, I wouldn't go there. They'll kill
you there!'' Then the hospital's new president jogs into a staff
meeting and, in a scene that takes precisely 25 seconds, fires most
of the doctors. When they go to court to get their jobs back, the
judge angrily instructs their lawyer to tell his clients he's a
toad, then corrects himself, ``a big toad.'' Oh, and the nine-hour
operation to remove an inoperable brain tumor from a 9-week-old
baby is a success.
</P>
<P>
   This is not ``South Park.'' It is ``Chicago Hope,'' or rather,
the new ``Chicago Hope.'' That was the plot line of the last
episode of the spring, and it was, to put it mildly, a harbinger of
changes to come in the direction of a fairly traditional and slowly
dying one-hour drama that CBS is attempting to resurrect from last
year's ratings slump. It is a highly unusual gamble, not unlike
operating on an inoperable tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time television series are tinkered with all the time.
This fall, for instance, the British comic Eric Idle, a ``Monty
Python'' alumnus, is joining the cast of ``Suddenly Susan,''
Heather Locklear is coming to ``Spin City,'' and ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place'' is being renamed ``Two Guys'' and moved out of
its pizza parlor.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at CBS and the 20th-Century Fox studio, which
produces ``Chicago Hope,'' said that to the best of their
recollection no major prime-time drama had been reinvented so
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago Hope'' is, in effect, being hit with a triple heart
bypass, electroshock therapy, multiple organ transplants and a
fashion makeover, in the form of new producers, a new writing
staff, the replacement of nearly half the cast _ among the incoming
actors are Barbara Hershey, Mandy Patinkin (who was on the show in
its first couple of seasons), Carla Gugino and Lauren Holly _ and a
new time slot, not to mention new opening titles and new theme
music.
</P>
<P>
   These are desperate times in network television; audiences and
profits have been dwindling rapidly. And the show's radical
overhaul reflects the depth of the anxieties rippling through the
industry. None of the major networks, CBS included, have produced a
hit one-hour drama recently. (The most Emmy nominations for a drama
this year were for ``The Sopranos,'' which is on HBO, a cable
channel.) But in CBS' view ``Chicago Hope'' has a few strong points
that make the experiment worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the show's audience has tumbled from a peak of an
11.9 rating and a 20 share in 1995-96 to a 7.5 rating and 13 share
last season, according to Nielsen Media Research. (Each rating
point represented 994,000 homes last season; share is the
percentage of homes watching television tuned to that show.) But
``Chicago Hope'' has been on the air since the fall of 1994, and it
is already being rerun on the Lifetime channel. Thus there is high
name recognition and at least a modest base of viewer interest to
build on, rather than starting from scratch in a glutted market in
which new shows have been doing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, ``Chicago Hope'' has a star who is
assuming a more active role: no, not one of the doctors in scrubs,
but the show's creator, David E. Kelley, who is the hottest writer
and producer in television. After Kelley started ``Chicago Hope''
in 1994 he moved on, as is common, and created his current
successes, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' This fall he has
two new shows, an edited-down half-hour version of the one-hour
``Ally,'' and a show about private detectives, ``Snoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing signs that ``Chicago Hope'' was headed toward
cancellation, Kelley approached people at CBS early last spring and
said he would become a hands-on producer again if they would give
the show another chance. The network was initially lukewarm but
finally agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation reflected another reality of network television:
producers can earn much more money creating new shows than sticking
with old ones. As an executive producer, a veteran can earn $1
million or so a year, but a producer who creates a new show that
catches on can earn tens of millions of dollars, not to mention a
multimillion-dollar deal with a studio to create more shows.
</P>
<P>
   The two executive producers who had run ``Chicago Hope'' for
several seasons, John Tinker and Bill D'Elia, said they had begun
to pull back from day-to-day involvement in the series last season
because they wanted to concentrate on developing new shows. They
said they were not unhappy about being replaced as executive
producers this year, because it allowed them to put all their
efforts into the three ideas they were pitching the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show needed some major changes, and we realized we weren't
the guys to do that again,'' said D'Elia. ``We had our development
deal, and that was what John and I wanted to focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley made the changes as he swept back in from the other shows
he had developed. He wrote the jolting season-ending episode as
well as a rather unconventional opening episode for this fall in
which a Roman Catholic priest's sex organ is bitten off during a
robbery then surgically reattached, and an elderly man dies in the
recovery room after liposuction while his surgeon trades stocks on
the Internet. Naturally the doctors also perform a near-miracle in
saving a boy on the operating table whose damaged heart is spewing
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``By design I wanted to send a wake-up call that the show will
be very different,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not planning to produce more scripts himself, he added,
but will supervise the writing and offer suggestions on future
scripts, giving ``Chicago Hope'' his continuing creative
imprimatur, a major incentive for the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the most important thing is his involvement,'' Leslie
Moonves, the president of CBS Television, said of Kelley's new
role. ``I'm aware he has a lot on his plate. But it's a little bit
of a promotional thing. If a talent like David Kelley comes in and
pitches you a hospital show, how do you say no?''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th-Century Fox Television, put
it more directly: ``If David Kelley were not in the mix and had not
pledged to do what he said he would do, this wouldn't have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, CBS has very modest expectations for the show. Moonves
made it clear that he was hoping for, at best, a slight jump in the
show's share of the market. In other words, the networks, with the
sharp declines in their share of the viewing audience, rarely
expect the kind of 20- and 30-share hits that used to be common.
They are now delighted with what in football terms would be called
``three yards and a cloud of dust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for a turnaround,'' Moonves said. ``We
specifically put it in a place where a 14 share will be good, very
good. Our expectations are not big. With a point or two increase in
share, we look great.'' He added, ``It's a new era.''

LOS ANGELES: new era.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The show is also going against a powerful trend of vying for a
young audience, generally the 18-to-34-year-old age group. None of
the changes this season are expected to focus on that fickle
audience, and the show's new time slot _ Thursday nights at 9,
starting on Sept. 23 _ puts it opposite NBC's blockbuster evening
of sitcoms, which attract young, largely male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our mandate is to attract more older viewers,'' said
Henry Bromell, one of the new executive producers for ``Chicago
Hope'' and the head of its writing team.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been star-crossed from its first broadcast, on
Sept. 18, 1994. It was scheduled that fall on Thursday nights
opposite another medical show, NBC's ``E.R.'' That was unfortunate
because ``E.R.'' went on to become one of the most celebrated and
successful dramas on television, leaving ``Chicago Hope'' deep in
its shadow.
</P>
<P>
   It then began a hapless peregrination around the CBS schedule.
At one point it found what seemed a solid home on Monday nights but
was bumped for a new drama, ``Brooklyn South,'' in 1997. When that
show failed, another new drama, ``L.A. Doctors,'' took the Monday
slot, leaving ``Chicago Hope'' on Wednesdays with no strong show in
front of it to bring in an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the show's plot lines began to drift in odd
directions. ``Chicago Hope'' had been conceived as a story of a
hospital: the last, best hope, in the words of Kelley. The focus
was intended to be the frontiers of medicine. But over the past
couple of seasons the doctors themselves and their tangled personal
lives took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kate Austin, played by Christine Lahti, wanted to become an
astronaut until she damaged her knee in an accident. Dr. Dennis
Hancock (Vondie Curtis-Hall) became a social activist and a
politician. Dr. Billy Kronk (Peter Berg) went to Africa to do
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost bordering on a soap opera,'' said Michael
Pressman, who directed the pilot episode in 1994 and has been
brought back as one of the executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those characters, and a few others, were summarily
let go in last spring's bloodletting, and Kelley said the show was
careering back essentially to what it had been originally. While
``Chicago Hope'' will still seek to create compelling characters
and stories, ``my focus is on the field of medicine,'' said Kelley.
``The hospital will be the biggest character on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromell said the doctors would rarely be seen out of their
scrubs. ``I want to see these characters only as they manifest
themselves at work,'' he said. ``The more you separate these
characters from the workplace, the less interesting they become,
not more.''
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin played the brilliant, abrasively egotistical Dr.
Jeffrey Geiger in the first several seasons before leaving to focus
on his family and singing career. Geiger is now the hospital's
president, the one who fired most of the old staff in last season's
closer, but Patinkin said he never would have considered coming
back were it not for Kelley's personal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to bring back the ensemble feeling to the
show,'' said Patinkin. ``Our old show got swept away. I feel like
we're getting back to where it was before that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remaining actors said they suffered from survivor's
guilt, as Adam Arkin, who plays the warmhearted Dr. Aaron Shutt,
put it. Hector Elizondo, who plays the hospital's chief of staff,
Dr. Phillip Watters, said he even considered quitting.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent afternoon the team was on the set, bantering
comfortably between shots and, Elizondo said, taking some comfort
in the fact that at least the crew was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a secure moment,'' said Pressman. ``It's a
complete unknown how this show will do.''

AFTER MARATHON FIRST GAME, CHESS RIVALS QUICKLY DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ROBERT BYRNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after their nearly six-hour opener, Alexander Khalifman
of Russia and Vladimir Akopian of Armenia agreed to a short draw on
Monday in Game 2 of their International Chess Federation
Championship Match. That gives Khalifman a 1{-{ lead over Akopian
in the six-game series, which is under way at Caesar's Palace in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The game was strategic and undramatic in character, with
Akopian, as Black, choosing a highly regarded defense and Khalifman
unable to make serious headway against it.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the quality of the moves, both players were surely
worn out by their demanding 58-move first-round encounter and in no
mood to risk another so soon. This time they played only 18 moves.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, too, that Akopian was waiting until he has the
advantage of the white pieces before making his move to get back on
even terms. But the pressure is on him to win. If he cannot,
Khalifman can take the title by merely drawing the next four games.
All he needs is a total of 3{ points.
</P>
<P>
   The Capablanca Variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defense, 4 Qc2, is
a conservative, positional line that protects against the doubled
pawns resulting from ... Bc3 bc. White often plays to obtain the
bishop pair, but not that way. The idea is to avoid weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no hindrance to attacking the d4 pawn (the queen
is not protecting it), Black, as here, thrusts 4 ... c5, knowing
that a routine defense like 5 e3 could be met easily by 5 ... Nc6 6
Nf3 cd 7 ed d5 8 a3 Bc3 9 bc Bd7.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifman's choice, 5 dc, opens the d line for possible later
pressure against the backward d7 pawn. The point of the development
with 5 ... Qc7 is to prohibit 6 Bf4, which could otherwise serve as
an important step in controlling d6.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategical finesse in the system Akopian adopted is 7
... Qb6, forcing 8 e3, after which the white queen bishop cannot
get to f4.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Akopian's labored mobilization, he had gotten his last
piece out with 17 ... Bb7 and had a compact, weakness-free
formation. There was no way that Khalifman could exploit the d6
pawn now. He still maintained a little space advantage, but it was
not obvious how that could be augmented.
</P>
<P>
   The one attempt at a trick, after 18 ... Nf6, would have been 19
Rd6?, which would have been proved faulty at once by 19 ... Be4 20
Be4 Bd6. Khalifman offered a draw and Akopian accepted.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ As recently as two weeks ago, advocates of
political and economic reform in Turkey were looking forward to a
busy and perhaps momentous autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament was to consider several far-reaching proposals,
including measures to address the Kurdish conflict, which has cost
tens of thousands of lives over the past 15 years. With the main
Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in prison and calling for an
end to the violence, the time seemed ideal for new government steps
to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's earthquake blew even the Kurdish war off the
national agenda. Debate over the government's proposal to offer
amnesty to guerrillas who surrender, for example, has been
postponed indefinitely. Although Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit had
announced his support for large investments to combat poverty and
unemployment in the mostly Kurdish southeast, there will probably
be no money to pay for such programs now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much money around anyway, but now even the modest
funds that might have gone to development projects in the southeast
are going to be diverted to earthquake relief,'' said Dogu Ergil,
director of a foundation that has advocated new approaches to
Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask any politician today what is going to happen to the
Kurds now, he will say, `Are you crazy? What are you talking about?
This is no time to talk about the Kurdish situation.' It is no
longer a primary or even a secondary item on the political
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the quake has passed 18,000 and is expected
to climb still higher. Rescue teams found no survivors on Tuesday
and do not expect to find any more. Tens of thousands of people are
still missing, and hundreds of thousands of survivors are homeless.
The government issued a new appeal for aid, saying it especially
needs tents, flashlights, blankets, garbage trucks, disinfectants
and tetanus vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old Turkish soldier was quarantined on Tuesday after
doctors determined that he appeared to have contracted typhoid
fever. Government officials have said they fear epidemic diseases,
but there was no indication that the soldier was more than an
isolated case.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for earthquake victims and rebuilding destroyed homes and
businesses will cost billions of dollars, which means not only that
many other projects will be postponed, but also that new taxes may
be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey had been negotiating with the International Monetary Fund
for a multibillion-dollar loan, and officials say they are
determined not to relax fiscal discipline despite the pressing need
for earthquake relief. ``Any revision in macroeconomic policies and
other reforms is out of the question,'' said the Central Bank
president, Gazi Ercel.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials said in Washington on Tuesday that they were also
considering an emergency loan.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish politicians, who won some sweeping victories in
southeastern cities in elections in April, are eager to show they
share the concerns of the rest of the country. They are helping to
raise funds for earthquake victims and have carefully avoided
pleading their own case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been through a similar situation,'' said Huseyin Umit,
mayor of Hakari and a leader of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy
Party. ``We had our own `earthquake' when our villages were
evacuated, and we became very poor'' during the fighting between
Turkish troops and Kurdish rebels. ``Nobody has given us any help
or compensation, but we want to be mature and patient. Although
promises have been made to us, we cannot expect that they will be
kept until these difficult days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Turks hope the widespread public anger over failures in the
relief effort will lend new urgency to proposals to restructure the
state. But others fear that the anger will dissipate and that
politics will continue as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is still in a daze,'' said Kemal Koprulu, an advocate
of political reform who has been working to coordinate private
relief efforts. ``Not just the Kurdish issue but every issue has
been pushed off the agenda because the country is focused on just
one thing. But they'll come back, because they have to be tackled
in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Kurds go, there may be some positive results of
this tragedy,'' Koprulu added. ``First of all, we've been seeing
how even the poorest Kurdish towns in the southeast are sending
help to the earthquake area, which shows that they feel very much a
part of this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, some of the resistance to changing policy toward the
Kurds has been the fear that this issue is part of a plot by the
rest of the world, which hates us and is out to destroy us. That
thesis has been destroyed by the fantastic aid we've gotten from 60
countries, starting with Greece. So maybe we'll be able to look at
this situation more rationally now.''

 That stuff about the deficit affecting interest rates? Don't buy
it  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most enduring economic myths of this generation is
the widely held but erroneous belief that federal budget deficits
cause high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of such thinking abounded over the weekend in responses
to a Saturday column challenging a Wall Street Journal story about
how Johnson Countians seem lukewarm to the Republican tax-relief
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was fairly balanced pro and con, but typical of
those opposing the GOP tax-cut plan was a StarTouch call from a
county resident whose opposition was based on a desire to lower the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would keep interest rates down and thus ``help
the stock market, businesses and anyone that pays interest.''
</P>
<P>
   First of all, those who share this view should be informed that
the national debt is being paid down, even as we speak. This week's
Treasury sale of about $15 billion in two-year notes will result in
an $11.36 billion paydown of the national debt because $26.36
billion in similar notes are maturing. This is how federal debt
gets pared. Not with partisan political posturing, but with
maturing issues of Treasury securities quietly being refunded with
smaller amounts of new debt.
</P>
<P>
   As for the relationship among deficits, debt and interest rates,
the surprising reality of the past two decades is how rates
declined as deficits soared and debt ballooned. As 1981 dawned and
the national debt neared the $1 trillion mark, the prime rate banks
charge their most creditworthy business borrowers peaked at 21.5
percent. Mortgage rates and yields on long Treasuries and
investment-grade corporate bonds were headed for tops in the
mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the long secular trend for interest rates
and inflation has been down. This has happened even though Uncle
Sam added more than $4.5 trillion to the national debt with
relentlessly humongous annual budget deficits. Only recently have
interest rates shown signs of resurgence, and the development comes
paradoxically as the federal budget is moving from red ink to
black.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the myth seems perfectly logical. The more the
Treasury must borrow, it stands to reason, the smaller the pool of
credit available for businesses and consumers. It's called
``crowding out'' and assumes increased federal borrowing demand
will push rates higher for both government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened, but the conventional wisdom is so compelling
that most average people never stopped to ponder how conventional
wisdom had turned on its head. Now it's being turned on its head
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury expects to record a budget surplus of close to $100
billion for the fiscal year ending next month. Never mind that
nearly all of this surplus will result from excess Social Security
revenue; it's still on the books as a surplus. Nevertheless,
interest rates show signs of ending their era of decline despite
the continuing absence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Although what's happening in the real world is counterintuitive,
it's still the reality, even without a reasonable explanation.
Therefore, if you're against a tax cut, it has to be for a more
rational reason than believing high taxes ensure relatively low
interest rates.

KANSAS CITY'S RIVERBOAT GAMBLING BREAKS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gamblers left $44.7 million behind at Kansas City's riverboats
in July, shattering monthly casino revenue records.
</P>
<P>
   That's about 60 percent of what City Hall spends during an
average month to run the whole city.
</P>
<P>
   The old record, $42.8 million, was set in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It exceeds our expectations,'' said John Finamore, Station
Casino Kansas City president and general manager, of the local
appetite for casino games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have thought a year ago it would be at this point
_ almost $45 million.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Station edged past Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP;
Hotel to seize the market share crown for the second time ever.
Last September, Station surpassed Harrah's by a fraction of a
point, but then slipped back to second place the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's General Manager Michael St. Pierre predicts the same
pattern this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely in a horse race'' with Station, St. Pierre
said. ``But their facility attracts more tourists than gamblers,
and July is the number one tourist month in Kansas City. So you'd
expect to see Station do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to another one-month run of Station
leading the market. We intend to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Station, Harrah's and Argosy Riverside Casino all set individual
revenue marks in July, with Station and Harrah's each topping $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said Station's $15.8 million month also appeared to be
a statewide record, surpassing Harrah's $15.6 million month in
August 1996 and $15.7 million last month.
</P>
<P>
   Casino revenue is expected to grow even more dramatically after
the Missouri Gaming Commission eliminates restrictive boarding
times and allows the public unfettered access to slot machines and
other betting games at the state's 15 casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, that change is still at least a month away.
</P>
<P>
   The commission last week launched an open boarding pilot project
on the east side of the state. Open boarding for casinos here is
expected to be on the agenda today when the commission meets in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Commission staff members met with local casino executives
Tuesday to begin discussing the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably six to eight weeks down the road,'' Finamore
said, as casinos refine their computer programs and make physical
alterations to accommodate the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a worst-case scenario,'' he added. ``Hopefully, it's
not a big problem and we can go quicker than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaming Commission Executive Director Mel Fisher said Tuesday
that the timetable was largely up to the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their call,'' he said. ``The only thing we're interested
in is that they all do it at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the experiment in St. Louis is a success, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's going well,'' he said. ``They've had large
crowds and handled it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre said admissions and revenue were up at Harrah's
Maryland Heights property, but he declined to disclose specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore also declined to reveal financial performance figures
at Station's St. Charles casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in our industry thinks this (open
boarding) is a pot of gold,'' Finamore said. ``I've always felt it
would be nominal. It's not insignificant. But it's somewhere
between a push and 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   State gambling officials agree. They estimate the statewide
effect at around 8 percent, or $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said early estimates in St. Louis showed that admissions
were up as much as 40 percent _ which means a big boost for state
and local governments' casino head-tax collections. Statewide, a 40
percent annual admissions bump could mean $32 million more in
head-tax collections alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Illinois' riverboats went to open boarding in late June,
admissions jumped 50 percent while revenue soared to all-time
highs. But Finamore said he didn't expect Missouri to encounter the
same kinds of revenue increase as Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Open boarding in Missouri could bring other changes as well.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilot project emerges as permanent state policy, Harrah's
twin casinos in Maryland Heights and Station's twins in Kansas City
are expected to undergo physical renovations as single-floor
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   And Harrah's North Kansas City has ambitious plans, as yet
unannounced, to expand its Mardi Gras vessel's gambling capacity
and perhaps also operate as a one-boat casino.

 &HT;    Long-distance eludes BellSouth in '99
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. is still waiting for a long-distance
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-one-half years after passage of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, officials of BellSouth are still champing
at the bit, waiting for federal regulators to let them offer
long-distance service in the nine Southeast states that make up
BellSouth turf.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like it will not happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   In touting the 1996 telecom law, politicians of both parties and
industry executives predicted a grand competition of all against
all. Regional Bells would burst into long-distance, long-distance
providers would leap into local service and consumers would reap
the benefits of choice in all manner of telecom services.
</P>
<P>
   The act has not yet delivered on those promises.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Georgia consumers _ at least those paying attention _
have been treated to a long debate, as BellSouth's competitors
insist the company doesn't deserve to be in long-distance. The
question is: Has BellSouth opened its network so that a competitive
local exchange carrier _ a CLEC _ can compete on equal footing for
local customers? That is what the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has spent more than $500 million improving its network
to make connections smoother, said Phil Jacobs, president of
BellSouth for Georgia. ``We think we have met both the letter and
the spirit of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivals argue that their orders are handled clumsily. Brian
Sulmonetti, regional director of public policy for MCI WorldCom,
scoffed at the notion that BellSouth deserves entry into
long-distance. ``I don't think BellSouth is close. Long-distance
was supposed to be the carrot so that BellSouth would open its
local network, but it doesn't seem to be enough of a carrot.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught between competing stories, the state Public Service
Commission voted in June to let neutral parties test BellSouth's
network. Hewlett-Packard and KPMG were chosen to set up a kind of
shadow CLEC. With offices in Alpharetta and Dunwoody, they will
place orders and see how they are handled. The idea is to correct
problems along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Testers were to issue a report Aug. 19, but the process was a
bit more complicated than expected, said PSC Commissioner David
Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it takes more time, we want to do it right,'' Burgess
said. ``By the end of the year, we will be in a position to make a
yea or nay decision. The results of the test are a big piece of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T both loudly called for testing, but now
criticize the process in Georgia, contrasting it to testing planned
for other states, including BellSouth in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some concerns,'' said Jaimie Hardin, AT&AMP;T vice
president for government affairs. ``This test was designed by
BellSouth. It's not a true CLEC experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess said competitors will have plenty of chance to comment
once the testers are through. But with PSC endorsement, BellSouth
could quickly file with the Federal Communications Commission for
the right to offer long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   At stake now is the long-distance market in the Southeast _ $10
billion a year flowing from BellSouth customers to AT&AMP;T, MCI
WorldCom, Sprint and others.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance has become an increasingly cutthroat business with
thinning margins, as evidenced by the spate of ads touting
dime-a-minute and even nickel-a-minute calling. Still, some of its
value is strictly defensive. Telecom companies now offer
``bundles'' of services, hoping to hold an answer for all customer
needs. So if customers have to go elsewhere for one piece _
long-distance _ they may just decide to get it all somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packaging clearly is important,'' said BellSouth's Jacobs.
``Being able to have long-distance in your portfolio will be
critical. We don't want to be in a position where we cannot
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And while BellSouth holds the lion's share of phone business in
its nine-state region, the horizon is filling with potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominously, AT&AMP;T has plunked down $120 billion to purchase
cable television companies like MediaOne with the idea that
upgraded cable lines will eventually offer virtually all
telecommunications services. AT&AMP;T also plans to use pieces of
BellSouth's network outside MediaOne turf, Hardin said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T joins MCI WorldCom, and a pack of providers are
already offering bundles, starting with local service, to business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is lost business. While BellSouth continues to report
record profits each quarter, it has seen a steady loss of customers
to the new competition.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 customer lines have been lost in Georgia, and more
than 1 million lines have been taken by competitors across the
nine-state region. BellSouth has 4 million lines in Georgia and 23
million regionwide, so the loss is but a fraction of BellSouth's
business. However, it often represents the most lucrative portion _
business customers in large metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Even when allowed into long-distance, BellSouth cannot expect to
take all or even most of that long-distance market, of course. But
company Chief Executive Duane Ackerman has predicted the company
will take 20 percent of that market, expressing frustration that
the company cannot try.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. The final gatekeeper is the FCC, which has
slammed the gate shut on each bid by a Bell.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has already gone to the FCC three times _ twice for
Louisiana, once for South Carolina _ and come away with three
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Political pressure has lately mounted on the gatekeeper to let
somebody through. But it may not be BellSouth. Also working their
way toward an FCC showdown early next year are SBC in Texas and
Bell Atlantic in New York, both also going through third-party
testing.

NEW SEAT BELT LAW BEGINS SEPT. 1 IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Beginning Sept. 1, children under the age of 15 riding
in a motor vehicle in Texas must wear seat belts no matter where
they are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Before the state Legislature changed the law during the last
session, children between the ages of 4 and 14 did not have to wear
seat belts if they were sitting in the back seat of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see kids that are 6 or 7 years old standing up in the back
seat,'' said Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Steve
Hargett. ``They didn't have to wear seat belts in the back seat
under the old law. Well, now they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The law still requires the use of safety seats for children
under the age of 2 and safety seats or seat belts for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Hargett said unrestrained children become projectiles when
vehicles are involved in traffic accidents and that injury and
death can result in even minor incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen where young children were killed and there wasn't
even a collision. They are standing up on the front seat, the
parent hits the brake and they go forward and hit their head on the
dashboard,'' Hargett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hargett said motorists usually offer two basic excuses for not
using seat restraints for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they normally do, but they didn't this time because
they were in a hurry. Or, basically they don't want to fight with
the kid to make him do it because he cries or doesn't want to stay
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to DPS statistics, during the first six months of last
year, 123 children under the age of 15 were killed in Texas motor
vehicle accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Of those killed, 29 were wearing restraints while 50 were not.
In eight cases restraint usage was not known and in the remaining
incidents seat belt use was not applicable.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Shook, director of the emergency department of Texas
Children's Hospital in Houston, said motor vehicle accidents are
the leading cause of death and disability for children over the age
of 1.
</P>
<P>
   She said most injuries could be reduced in terms of seriousness
and in many cases prevented completely if people would use seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a high-velocity wreck these children become missiles and
are propelled out of the motor vehicle and can have severe or often
fatal head injuries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shook said progress has been made in recent years as more and
more people use seat restraints for their children but added there
is still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   She said the excuses that are given to police are the same ones
heard in the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it is an inconvenience or they say the children
don't want to wear them,'' she said. ``You should tell them you are
not starting the motor until your seat belt is on.''
</P>
<P>
   Shook said she can understand that some people resent the law as
another government intrusion of their lives but added that in this
case the law has a worthy goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how a parent or anyone could ever forgive
themselves if they were driving a car and a child was needlessly
killed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other traffic law changes becoming effective Sept. 1 include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The legal threshold for driving while intoxicated was lowered
from .10 blood alcohol concentration to .08.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large trucks, vehicles pulling trailers, and certain types of
school buses will now be able to drive the same speed limit as cars
on interstate and state highways.
</P>
<P>
   _ The speed limit on beaches was lowered to 15 mph.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vehicle inspection fees were increased.
</P>
<P>
   _ New driver's licenses and renewals will have a surface that
the license holder can use for entering a telephone number for use
by law enforcement agencies in the event there is a need to contact
next of kin.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sandy Berger, widely regarded as the president's
closest foreign policy aide, perhaps the most influential national
security adviser since Henry Kissinger, is at bottom a political
rather than strategic figure.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the professors, diplomats and military officers who have
for the most part preceded him in his job, he made his way to the
White House by way of the salons and back rooms of Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In essence a consensus-seeker and a deal-cutter, Berger's public
career as a trade lawyer strengthened those tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the lawyer's inherent caution,'' said John Dyson, a New
York investor and political operative who has known Berger since
college. ``The craft is a tactical craft. You focus on the
downside, always worrying about avoiding negative results.''
</P>
<P>
   Beefy and chubby-cheeked at 53, Berger has known the president
since the McGovern presidential campaign of 1972, and has helped
Clinton in small but important ways at low points in his career. He
also is one of the few who has served the entire two terms of the
Clinton administration, and has a closer relationship to the
president than Secretary of State Madeleine Albright or Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to find anyone who knows him who does not like
Berger personally. His ego is of normal dimensions. He buys his
reading glasses at the drug store. In a city where backbiting is
the preferred contact sport, he is widely considered a gentleman.
In a culture of 12-hour-days, he regularly puts in Stakhanovite
stints of 15 and 16 hours, fueled by endless glasses of iced
coffee, which he took to drinking when he gave up smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger gets very mixed reviews as a security adviser from
those outside his immediate circle. A European ambassador said he
lacked ``the indispensable ability to see around corners, to
anticipate events and to see how one problem relates to another.''
A friend and sometime administration colleague said Berger lacked
strategic vision but ``wants to be accepted as a kind of Sandy
Kissinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger himself commented rather condescendingly, ``you can't
expect a trade lawyer to be a global strategist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, Clinton's former political guru, wrote recently
that ``there are hundreds of members of the Council on Foreign
Relations who know more about foreign policy than Berger,'' but he
added that Berger was ``just right'' for the president's concept of
foreign policy which, he said, centers on domestic political and
economic considerations, not on strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense Berger's friends note that while Clinton's
attention to events abroad is normally intermittent, the president
was especially distracted for almost two years by the Lewinsky
matter. One retired American diplomat blamed ``a disastrous Balkan
policy, in which every aspect has been treated incrementally,''
mostly on the president.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Berger has to deal with a world seismically remade by
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a new framework for American foreign policy,''
said Harry McPherson, a Texan who worked in the Johnson White House
and has closely watched all administrations that have followed.
``Well, great. But who has produced one? Sandy's a carpenter, not
an architect, like everyone else these days. He's a good one, and
that may be the best we can hope for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger grew up in Millerton, N.Y., a then-isolated rural
community of 900 people in the dairy country northeast of
Poughkeepsie. His father died when he was only 8, and his mother
ran a struggling Army-Navy surplus store.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers stood apart from the Millerton mainstream, as
Democrats in a town where ``people gave parties when F.D.R. died,''
and as Jews in the WASP heartland. Berger took his religious
training from a rabbi in a nearby hospital for the mentally
retarded. Young Sandy Berger had another distinguishing feature: He
was a fervent Dodger fan in a Yankee town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I grew up is very important to what I am,'' he said.
``My perspectives are still more Millerton 1960 than Washington
2000. The small-town sense of community and social responsibility _
that's the lasting imprint of Millerton on me.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell University, he came under the sway of an assistant
dean, Albert Miles, who got him interested in questions of social
justice. He asked civil rights leaders like Stokely Carmichael to
Cornell to speak, he fought discrimination in the fraternities,
closing down one that barred blacks from a party, and he persuaded
James Perkins, the university president, to fly to Cornell a group
of black schoolchildren from Brooklyn who had created a a black
history project that no one had come to see.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Cornell, where he met his wife, Susan, Berger
encountered an important intellectual mentor, George McT. Kahin, a
historian of Southeast Asia. He took the course on Vietnam taught
by Professor Kahin, whose books became the testaments of the
anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   But while Berger says that his opposition to the war derived
from that course, he never marched against the war, preferring, as
he put it, to work within the system, first as a summer intern in
Washington for Rep. Joseph Resnick, a millionaire
television-antenna manufacturer from the Catskills. At Harvard Law
School, Berger volunteered first for Eugene McCarthy, then for
Robert F. Kennedy, displaying the kind of pragmatism that sometimes
gets him in trouble in his present job with more ideologically
rigorous types.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, on the dovish McGovern campaign, he met a man
wearing a Colonel Sanders white suit, Bill Clinton, and the two
quickly became buddies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dovish theme continued at Hogan &AMP; Hartson, one of
Washington's premier law firms, where Berger, who represented
Japanese and other clients, talked often with the firm's most
eminent figure, former Sen. J. William Fulbright, the godfather of
the anti-war movement. When he went into the State Department in
the Carter administration, he fought in the trenches alongside the
dovish secretary, Cyrus Vance, against the more hawkish national
security adviser, Brzezinski, and resolved to do all he could to
avoid such fights if he ever found himself in a position of real
power.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Carter administration, the years from 1968 to
1992 were Republican years, but Berger found ways to keep a
political oar in. He formed an important alliance with Pamela
Harriman, the Washington social doyenne, writing speeches for her
and benefiting, in turn, from her wealth and connections.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton lost a re-election bid as Arkansas governor in
1980, Berger persuaded Mrs. Harriman to put the young ex-governor
on the board of her political action committee, which came to be a
major fund-raising arm of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ran for president in 1992, Berger joined him as a
senior foreign-policy adviser. When Clinton won, Berger helped
persuade him to send Mrs. Harriman to Paris as ambassador. Berger
was offered the national security adviser's job but demurred on the
grounds of limited experience, suggesting Tony Lake instead. Berger
became Lake's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   But during Clinton's first term, says a person who held a senior
position during that period, ``everyone with a problem in the
security area went to Sandy _ honest, helpful, Sandy, who never
lied _ and he built up a tremendous amount of credibility that
helped him enormously once he took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials in the State Department and the Defense
Department praise Berger's trustworthiness and his ability to run
meetings, though some of the generals and admirals are not entirely
comfortable with him or any of the old anti-war crowd and their
brand of cautious interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds of friendship between Clinton and Berger have held,
even in bad times, including the administration's difficulties with
China, the country with which Berger is most closely identified. It
is the country whose development, he once said, ``will have the
biggest impact on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   To shape that development, Berger has championed a policy of
engagement, in which the United States has tried to bind China to
the United States through economic and security arrangements. But a
lot of things have gone wrong lately, from illicit Chinese campaign
contributions to the Democrats to the accidental bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst for Berger personally were charges that he reacted
too passively when told about the suspected Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets. He insists that he acted properly when told of the
charges, even though he was late in briefing Clinton, waiting until
after March of this year, on detailed charges that Berger had
learned in July 1997. When asked if he felt whether he had dropped
the ball in any way, either in terms of substance or in terms of
appearances, Berger replied, cold-eyed, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's cherished reputation on the Hill has nonetheless taken
a hit, with several influential members of Congress calling for his
resignation. These calls have subsided, but he remains ``very
exposed and very vulnerable on this,'' according to a government
China specialist who admires him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best link we have with China,'' the specialist said.
``But he is viewed by our critics as someone who cares more about
China than the United States, and that limits his ability to take
initiatives with China. You need to explain the bombing, but you
can't send Sandy to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an inescapable sense that the Administration makes
policy on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the former White House press secretary,
concedes that ``we don't have a new definition of the U.S. role in
the world yet.'' In some moods, Berger sounds as if that's fine
with him. In 1991, he said during a panel discussion that most
``grand strategies'' were after-the-fact rationales developed to
explain successful ad hoc decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation, Berger said that he prefers to ``worry
about today today and tomorrow tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Atlanta reportedly ahead of U.S. in readiness
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new survey says that less than half the country's
big companies have readied their computer systems for 2000, but
local anecdotal evidence suggests metro Atlanta is doing better
than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds more severe than what I'm hearing about Atlanta
businesses,'' says Ted Fisher, a Y2K consultant who is secretary to
the Governor's Y2K Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the state's business community is safe from
computer failures triggered by an inability to recognize 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing that 10-20 percent of small businesses are facing
possibly serious problems because of Y2K,'' says Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage may not sound like a lot, but Georgia has
265,000 small businesses, representing 40 percent of the state's
work force. A small business is defined as one with fewer than 250
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The small companies in Georgia unprepared for Y2K snafus are in
good company, according to information and management consultant
Cap Gemini America.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, the New York-based company found that only
48 percent of the biggest companies expect to have all of their
most critical computer systems upgraded to recognize 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome is that 75 percent of the 144 corporate
information executives surveyed by Cap Gemini reported experiencing
at least one computer failure related to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The most common failure involved financial miscalculations. The
second-biggest problems were disruptions in processing and customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   These failures apparently have awakened companies to the Y2K
bug's potential as a troublemaker. ``The time has finally arrived
when top management views the Year 2000 challenge as a business
problem and not merely a technology problem,'' says Jim Woodward,
Cap Gemini's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini has been periodically surveying corporate information
managers at big companies about their Y2K readiness for more than a
year. Its respondents include companies from all major industries
and 17 government agencies.

ALBANIAN BLOCKADE CONTINUES TO DELAY RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands, Germany, Russia)   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Negotiations between peacekeeping commanders
and local Kosovo Albanians failed on Tuesday to end the blockade
around the town of Orahovac that is preventing Russian peacekeepers
from moving into the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have formed mile-long blockades on the roads into
the town with trucks, cars and tractors to stop the Russians. The
Albanians kept a nightlong vigil and stayed out in force all day on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They oppose the presence of Russian troops because, they say,
Russia sided with Serbia during the NATO bombing campaign this
spring and Russian mercenaries fought in Kosovo alongside Serbian
troops. The Albanians vowed to stay until NATO revises its plan and
sends other troops.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Russian unit that is to be stationed in
Orahovac met there with commanders of the Dutch and German
peacekeepers who are there now. The Russian arrived by helicopter
to avoid the roadblocks. Together, they met with Albanian leaders,
and then with local Serbs, but the Albanians refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it once again clear they don't want to have Russian
troops here in Orahovac and they want Dutch troops to stay,'' Maj.
Marcel Van Weerd, the chief of staff of the Dutch battalion, told
Reuters news agency after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Serbs with whom the peacekeepers met said they
did not care about the nationality of peacekeepers stationed in
their town. But the Serbs in the town seem to be divided on the
issue. Some say they prefer the status quo, which has brought a
certain calm to their little enclave. Others see the Russians as
potential allies and protectors.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force in Kosovo is intent on ending the protest
peacefully, and talks are to resume on Wednesday morning, said
Capt. Mike Bos, spokesman for the Dutch troops now in charge of the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't let anyone hurt anyone else, that's the most
important thing,'' he said. ``For the moment we will just hang on,
wait, keep on talking to the people so that everyone benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Dutch troops in Orahovac, Lt. Col. Tony van
Loon, said they had decided against using force to remove the
barricades and would continue trying to persuade the Albanians to
back down.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the peacekeeping force in Pristina, the
provincial capital, said that there was no chance of changing the
plan to station the Russian troops in Orahovac and suggested that
the standoff could be resolved within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the blockade
as an ``open challenge'' to the other countries involved and to
Russia's participation in the Kosovo peacekeeping force, Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deputy defense minister, Alexander Avdeyev, said it was
up to the peacekeeping commanders to sort out the problem so the
Russians could take their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops who were supposed to move into the town,
members of the elite paratrooper division, were taking the blockade
calmly, and spokesmen for the peacekeepers commended their
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could chopper them in,'' Bos said, ``but the Russians are
thinking about the future. We are going to make sure the Albanians
and Serbs, and the Dutch, Germans and Russians, all sit down and
agree.''

ACCUSED MURDERER'S DIARY SIFTED FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL CLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behavior scientists at a New Mexico federal crime lab are
studying murder defendant Raffi Kodikian's handwritten account of a
desert canyon slaying earlier this month, trying to discern his
state of mind when he stabbed his best friend to death.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico authorities said much of the evidence in the death of
David Coughlin, whose body was found in a shallow grave in Carlsbad
Caverns National Park on Aug. 8, was hand-delivered Tuesday to a
State Police crime lab in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   But Kodikian's journal _ a spiral notebook considered to be the
key piece of evidence _ was already being examined by the FBI's
crime lab in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Behavioral specialists are trying to use Kodikian's writings to
help unearth more information about exactly what occurred at the
bottom of remote Rattlesnake Canyon on a steamy summer weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, 25, of Boston, has told authorities that he and
Coughlin, 26, of Millis, Mass. had gotten lost in a rugged region
of the park and had run out of water. Desperate and dehydrated,
Kodikian has said he mercifully complied with Coughlin's request to
end the suffering. Authorities, however, are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studying the diary ``will do a lot of things,''
said Gary W. McCandless, the Eddy County sheriff's office chief of
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll give us a profile. They'll be able to tell us about
this guy's life and the state of mind he was in when this was
written,'' McCandless said. ``You wouldn't believe what they can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kodikian's lawyer, Gary Mitchell of Ruidoso, N.M., said the
FBI will search in vain for any nefarious motive. Coughlin's death,
he said, was an act of mercy _ not murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the FBI, it's not as simple as letting
some behavioral scientists tell us what happened,'' Mitchell said.
``I appreciate the fact that they're checking things out, but it's
something we don't fear from Raffi's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said there was no dispute between Kodikian and Coughlin
at the time, and no lingering resentment over some distant
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it'll boil down to their lives being in
jeopardy,'' he said, ``and how we react to that and how people
react to heat stroke and sun stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   According to autopsy results from the Albuquerque Medical
Examiner's Office, Coughlin was suffering from moderate to severe
dehydration at the time of his death and, under those conditions,
both men could have been delusional.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, who was accompanying Coughlin cross-country on his way
to graduate school in Santa Barbara, Calif., is staying at his
family's home in Pennsylvania while awaiting trial, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rutledge, the Carlsbad prosecutor whose office will try
the case against Kodikian, said he has not decided what degree of
murder chargehe will face. Kodikian, who has waived his
arraignment, is charged with an open count of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motive is not the issue,'' Rutledge said Monday on the CNN
program ``Burden of Proof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an element that we have to prove,'' he said. ``Juries
often want to hear a motive, but it's not an element required by
law'' to prove a defendant's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he does not expect Kodikian's trial to begin until
after Christmas. And while usually defendants are expected to
attend status conferences in New Mexico, he said Kodikian may not
have to return to the West until the trial opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence in this case to justify a first- or
second-degree murder charge,'' Mitchell said. ``This is more like a
case where a wife is dying from cancer and begs to be put out of
her misery. Most of us look at that as involuntary manslaughter,
not murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, a former Boston Globe editorial assistant who had
penned an account of a 1997 cross-country trip, wrote of Coughlin's
death, ``I killed and buried by best friend today,'' according to
Eddy County Sheriff M.A. ``Chunky'' Click, who read excerpts of the
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items sent to the police crime lab in Sante Fe Tuesday
were the hunting knife authorities believe was used in the
stabbing, a poncho and plastic cover with a red stain, a rock, a
T-shirt, and a bedroll.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said Kodikian is still in ``shock'' over Coughlin's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coping. He's stable. But he needs time to mourn the loss
of his friend and he needs time to put his life in order,'' the
attorney said.

DA MOVES TO BLOCK JUDGE'S ORDER FOR FELLS ACRES MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a move that one local attorney called ``highly
unusual,'' Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein has ordered both
sides in the Fells Acres child sex-abuse case to appear in court
Monday _ an order that Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley's
office has asked the state's highest court to quash, saying
Borenstein no longer has jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein's directive, issued Friday, came two days after the
Supreme Judicial Court overturned his decision granting a new trial
to Cheryl Amirault LeFave, who was convicted in 1987 of sexually
abusing children at her family's Malden day care center.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein offered no reason for the hearing in his order.
</P>
<P>
   But a court administrator said there will be ``no fireworks,''
just a routine status conference to determine when and where LeFave
will appear for the reinstatement of her conviction and sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has told me that he felt a responsibility to see this
through,'' Dana Leavitt, the administrator, said of Borenstein.
``Those were his words. He is not going to be critical of the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt also described as ``much ado about nothing'' speculation
that Borenstein is planning to publicly recuse himself from the
case, just as Superior Court Judge Robert A. Barton did in 1997
after the SJC overturned his decision to set aside the convictions
of LeFave and her mother, Violet Amirault, several years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Monday with the SJC, Coakley's office argued
that Borenstein no longer has authority over the case and that the
court hearing should be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley's office contends that the case is within the sole
jurisdiction of the SJC until the ruling is final, 28 days from the
date it was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the decision is finalized, Coakley's office argued,
Borenstein is no longer needed to reinstate Amirault's conviction
and sentence. That process should be handled in a Middlesex County
courtroom, her office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in its opinion does this court order this case to be
remanded to Justice Borenstein for further action, because no
further action by him is necessary,'' argued Assistant District
Attorney David W. Cunis in the prosecution's filing.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Rankin, a defense attorney for LeFave, called
Borenstein's order and Coakley's motion to quash it a ``strange
turn of events,'' but said he planned to appear in court
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's decision by the SJC means that LeFave, who had
served eight years of an 8- to 20-year prison sentence before being
released when her conviction was overturned in 1995, will almost
certainly be returning to prison in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, who has said LeFave will no longer pursue her case in
state courts, said he had not yet decided whether to begin a
federal court appeal of her conviction or to seek clemency from
Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically back to square one trying to figure out what
legal options Cheryl has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin also said that, should LeFave return to prison as
expected, it is unclear how much more time she will have to spend
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   During their imprisonment, LeFave and her mother _ who died of
cancer in 1997 _ were repeatedly denied parole, apparently because
they refused to admit guilt, Rankin said. An admission of guilt is
typically required for sex offenders to be paroled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when LeFave would be eligible for parole if she returns to
prison, a spokeswoman for the state's Parole Board said she ``can't
really speculate on the prognosis for parole at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a prisoner has ever been paroled without first
admitting guilt, spokeswoman Alberta Cook said: ``All I can say is
that the Parole Board considers many factors. I'd rather leave it
at that.''

 &HT;    EHatchery brings aid, comfort to Internet-savvy entrepreneurs
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeff Levy is an Internet success story. With his
friend and colleague Tim Cobb, he founded Relevant Knowledge, a
firm that proposed to measure Web traffic the way Nielsen measures
TV viewers. It was a novel idea at the time, but quickly became an
industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Relevant Knowledge merged with rival firm Media Metrix.
As the company's vice chairman, Levy helped lead the company to its
successful initial public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Now Levy is on his own again with a new Atlanta-based company
called eHatchery, an Internet-based incubator where entrepreneurs
can literally bring in an idea scrawled on the back of a napkin.
EHatchery will help turn it into a full-fledged company complete
with office space, strategic alliances, feature articles in the
trades and one day, perhaps an IPO of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dreams certainly came true with Relevant Knowledge,'' Levy
says. ``I'm excited by the opportunity to make other entrepreneurs'
dreams come true. It's exciting to look across the entire Internet
and all the opportunities out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Levy's first-person experience combined with
a stellar management team should give eHatchery a running start.
Former MCI WorldCom veteran Bill Wallace is chief operating
officer, and ex-Coca-Cola marketing guru Sergio Zyman is a senior
adviser. Levy also has the backing of the Pasadena, Calif-based
idealab, one of the top Internet incubators in the country whose
success stories include GoTo.com, eToys and Free-PC.
</P>
<P>
   Levy believes the next wave of Web entrepreneurs will be
Atlanta-based. From vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., he spoke
about the changing landscape of Internet start-ups and the changing
shape of Atlanta's growing Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How different is it starting an Internet company today from
when you began Relevant Knowledge in 1996?
</P>
<P>
   A: Atlanta is much more Internet-savvy than it was three years
ago. There are several venture capital firms, law firms, accounting
firms, public relations and marketing firms focused on the
Internet, which you did not see in 1996. You had to go out of town
in 1996. Relevant Knowledge used a Palo Alto, Calif., law firm
then. Now we use an Atlanta firm. The Internet has been
mainstreamed, and it's been accepted by the establishment. It's not
some way-out-there thing to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What makes Atlanta the place to start a venture like this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think this is the best place to start an Internet business
in the country. There's a wonderful infrastructure, thanks to the
Olympics. There's a sense in the venture capital community that
Atlanta is up and coming, and they see Atlanta as a new source of
venture opportunities. There's also a great labor supply, and I
don't mean people who've been working for Internet companies, but
people who've been working for large companies like Turner, Cox,
BellSouth, MCI, Lucent and UPS who have skill sets you can apply to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see eHatchery fitting into Atlanta's incubator
landscape? Isn't having ATDC (the Advanced Technology Development
Center) incubator at Georgia Tech enough?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're really very different from ATDC or almost any incubator
you've ever heard of.
</P>
<P>
   We're different in that we invest equity in our companies,
focusing exclusively on Internet companies. We won't be
technology-driven, but technology-enabled. Our companies won't be
selling hardware or software, but using technology to enable their
businesses. We are really focused on turning a great idea into a
great business. We provide all the financial and administrative
benefits. This is really plug and play _ you can have an idea one
day and a business the next.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will eHatchery do that other incubators can't, won't or
don't do?
</P>
<P>
   A: We want to bridge the gap between the time the company has an
idea and the time they can accept traditional venture capital. We
grow the business from an idea to 20 employees and a prototype.
That's really our sweet spot. I'm one of the few people in the
country that's seen an idea through from concept to public
offering. So I'm able to share experience with people as they go
through the process themselves.

FOR SAVARESE LOOKS TO FIRST WIN WITH REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He was the last man off the practice field Monday
evening at Babson College, but before he reached for a water
bottle, Revolution defensive midfielder and two-time MLS All-Star
Leonel Alvarez had a few words of encouragement for his new
teammate, Giovanni Savarese.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into his tenure with the Revolution, the 34-year-old
former Colombia national team mainstay _ traded from the
playoff-bound Dallas Burn to the struggling Revolution on Aug. 13 _
prefers not to look back at opportunity lost, but to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And if his experience and stature can rub off on his new team,
which is mired in a seven-game losing streak going into Wednesday
night's road game against the MetroStars, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy has always been to work extra hard with my
teammates, in order to win and to always take advantage of the home
field,'' said Alvarez through interpreter and Revolution media
relations assistant Jurgen Mainka. ``It is very important to me to
give our fans the satisfaction of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened lately, because the Revolution haven't won
since July 4, when they knocked off New York/New Jersey
(Wednesday's foe) at Foxboro Stadium. Simply put, the Revolution
have fallen and they can't find the net _ at least not very often
and not early enough. In those seven losses, the Revolution have
never taken a lead.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot, though, has been Alvarez, who has the
reputation as a fearless defender and smooth passer and has shown
his new team both of those attributes. Still, Alvarez admits has
has walked into a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a team that had already qualified for the playoffs
with 14 games to go, a team that had a need to win,'' he said.
``Here, the key is for us to all have a big heart, a great heart.
It is a hard transition to come from a team with a lot of happiness
to a team that needs a lot of work in order to be happy with their
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarez said he has nothing to prove to the Revolution or to
his old team; rather, the task ahead is to maintain his presence as
a world-class player and leader while blending into the team
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot demonstrate anything new,'' he shrugged. ``The
important thing is to practice and play as a group. I look forward
to the task and the new responsibility of coming here. Our
salvation is not me, it's us. All of us. We must be more positive
and work _ for a good coach, Walter Zenga. Many players in the
world would trade places with players here to play for Zenga.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Revolution, Zenga's accumulation of yellow
cards has resulted in a one-game suspension, so he'll be coaching,
but not playing in goal. Some pressure will thus fall on Alvarez to
provide a veteran presence on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, the former MetroStar, is happy that Alvarez will be
there to try to end the long losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win,'' said Savarese. ``We have been very lucky
that teams we are chasing for a playoff spot have also been losing
or only winning 1 point and we have to take advantage of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonel brings a lot of things to this team,'' he added. ``He's
a leader, he controls the ball, he's experienced, but most of all
he's a warrior who wants to win. Every time you're with him, he's
talking about the game and ways to win it. He's a big asset for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese said that during a break at Monday's practice, ``Leonel
was talking to me about Wednesday's game, what we need to do and
how we could become better as a team. With his experience, it's
great to have him. He says what he believes and what he thinks.
He's the first one to come to the practice field to help the other
players and he's the last to leave and that's to his credit.''

SOFT DRINK COMPANY PLAYS HARDBALL IN TEXAS SCHOOL LAWSUITS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Coke may claim to be the ``real thing'' in its ads,
but Dr Pepper says in a lawsuit filed Monday that it, and not Coke,
should be the only thing at Pearland Junior High East.
</P>
<P>
   The Dr Pepper Bottling Co. of Texas, based in Dallas, has sued
the Pearland Independent School District and the former principal
of the junior high school, Jacqueline Cobbin, because it claims it
had an exclusive contract to sell its soft drink products at the
Houston-area school.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Dr Pepper Bottling paid $2,640 to
erect a scoreboard at the Pearland Junior High East gym in 1996, in
exchange for the right to be the only soft drink sold at the school
until 2001. A contract signed by Dr Pepper Bottling and Cobbin in
March 1996 was included with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, the school district decided things go better
with Coke. The school district signed a contract to receive
$910,000 from Coca-Cola in exchange for selling only Coke soft
drinks at all its schools for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr Pepper is seeking unspecified damages in its state district
suit and is also asking that its contract be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taszarek, executive vice president of Dr Pepper Bottling Co.
of Texas, said Tuesday that the company has 10 similar lawsuits
pending across the state. He said he believes the suit against the
Pearland district will be resolved before trial, but declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to discuss why the Texas bottler of Dr Pepper _
a drink invented in Waco in 1885 _ has so many lawsuits against
school districts in the state. Taszarek said Dr Pepper is owned by
Cadbury Schweppes of London.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lenamon, spokeswoman for the 10,000-student Pearland
school district, said the district is not aware of any exclusive
contracts Cobbin may have signed with Dr Pepper. She said
principals do not have the authority to sign such contracts, and

 &HT;    Bush gets significant backing of state GOP
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Days before his first campaign swing through Georgia,
Republican presidential frontrunner George W. Bush increased his
backing in the state to include a majority of GOP legislators.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of them encouraged Bush to put an end to the
questions over possible past drug use that have dogged the campaign
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Bob Irvin, one of the 52 Republican
lawmakers who endorsed the Texas governor, said he should ``tell
the truth and the full truth as soon as possible . . . Something
somebody does a long time ago is a whole lot less important than
their behavior as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had refused to answer any questions about rumors that he
had taken drugs as a young man. Recently he has indicated that he
had not taken illegal drugs for at least the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the frenzy over the side-stepped question apparently did
little to diminish Bush's support in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 100 Republican lawmakers in the state
House and Senate, along with all five of the party's statewide
elected officials, endorsed Bush in a campaign-coordinated release
timed just before Bush's fund-raising visit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a choice whether to try to play it safe, or whether
you want to help lead the process,'' said Irvin (R-Atlanta), who
called Bush's record as Texas governor a solid basis for a
successful presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Among those throwing their support behind Bush are 33 of the 78
House Republicans and 19 of the 22 GOP Senate members.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP leadership in both bodies, though, remains split
among Bush and other GOP contenders, including former American Red
Cross President Elizabeth Dole. On Friday, Bush plans to tour MUST
Ministries at 10:30 a.m. Nancy Morris, director of the inter-faith
agency that helps people in need, said her organization is
nonpartisan but welcomes a visit from any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to represent the poor in our community to a
national candidate,'' Morris said.

EXPERIMENTAL DOUBLE TRANSPLANT GIVES WOMAN NEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was a medical Catch-22 that pushed Janet McCourt to
volunteer for an unprecedented experiment in transplantation that
would save her life _ and perhaps, researchers said Tuesday, mark a
turning point in organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off when McCourt, 57, a contractor from
Pembroke, received successful bone marrow and kidney transplants
simultaneously from her sister in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital say the double
transplant showed for the first time that giving bone marrow along
with an organ transplant from the same donor can eliminate the need
for anti-rejection drugs most transplant recipients need for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The sister's bone marrow ``educated'' McCourt's own immune
system so that it wouldn't reject the transplanted kidney as
foreign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this will be the beginning of trying to extend''
this strategy to many more transplant patients in the future in
hopes of avoiding lifelong immunosuppression, said Dr. David Sachs,
head of the transplant biology research center at MGH, where
McCourt underwent the procedure last September.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's double bind was created in 1997 when she was diagnosed
with multiple myeloma _ a form of blood cancer _ and kidney
failure. Because of the life-threatening cancer, she didn't qualify
for a kidney transplant, and, conversely, her kidney disease ruled
out a bone marrow transplant for the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been a fighter all my life, and I wasn't going to
accept that I was going to die,'' McCourt said Tuesday. In
particular, she vowed to live long enough to see her pregnant
daughter give birth to a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   After scouring the Internet and knocking on doctors' doors in
search of some new hope, she was referred to MGH, where Sachs, Drs.
Thomas Spitzer and Megan Sykes, and other researchers awaited a
good candidate for testing their strategy of using bone marrow
transplants to make the patient's body safe for an organ transplant
from the same person. It had already given spectacular results in
animals: One monkey is still healthy five years after a transplant,
without taking anti-rejection drugs. But the researchers would try
it for the first time in a human only in someone who needed both
the bone marrow and organ transplants anyway, to make sure they did
no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCourt said Tuesday that the doctors were at first
reluctant to try the technique on her, in part because she was so
weakened from the kidney disease that they didn't know if she would
survive the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also insisted that McCourt find a bone marrow donor
who was a perfect immunological match, to reduce the risks that the
transplants would be rejected. Again, fortune was in her favor:
Tests found that one of her sisters was an exact match. And of the
three sisters who were tested, the one who matched ``was the one
sister I knew would go ahead and do it, without letting her family
or anyone stop her,'' McCourt said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report this week in the journal Transplantation, the MGH
researchers describe the successful maneuver, in which they
undertook the double transplant and weaned her off
immunosuppressive drugs. That was nearly a year ago. Today she is
healthy, with no sign of organ rejection, and her cancer is in
remission. ``I feel very lucky,'' she said. ``I was not only able
to see my grandson born, but a granddaughter, too'' when her son's
wife gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important study,'' said Dr. Abdul Rao, director of
cell transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, where related experiments are under way. ``But there has to
be an element of caution, because what will happen with another
individual is a different ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplants for cancer are common, and are done
because the high doses of radiation or chemotherapy needed to
eradicate the cancer also destroy the patient's own bone marrow
tissues. Bone marrow generates blood cells, including the white
cells that form the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference in the new experiment is that the MGH
researchers gave McCourt a milder form of chemotherapy than would
be given in a conventional transplant. McCourt was so sick she
couldn't tolerate the normal doses of chemo, and and the doctors
wanted to make sure some of her own bone marrow cells would
survive. Part of the chemotherapy was aimed at killing off the
mature immune T-cells in her own bone marrow, so that they would
not attack the kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy created a ``mixed chimera'' in McCourt _ a mingling
of hers and her sister's bone marrow cells so that neither
dominated. ``It's believed that allowing some of the recipient's
bone marrow to survive may suppress'' a common complication of
transplants in which the donor marrow or organ attacks the host,
said Spitzer, lead author of the report, which also included as
authors Drs. Sachs, A. Benedict Cosimi, and Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the MGH researchers say they will use this strategy
only in patients who already need a bone marrow and organ
transplant at the same time, because the safety of the double
transplant is still not certain. Eventually, patients who need only
an organ may be pre-treated with the bone marrow solely to
``educate'' the host immune system not to attack the graft, they
said.

FIDELITY, CBS IN HUGE MULTIMEDIA AD DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fidelity Investments and CBS Corp. have signed an
advertising deal reportedly worth $50 million that gives the Boston
mutual fund company a huge presence on CBS television, radio,
Internet sites, and billboards, the companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which begins this fall, is one of the first and
said to be the largest deal so far assembled by CBS Plus, the
network's new sales unit set up last fall to peddle big multimedia
advertising packages.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the kind of deal that analysts said will become more
common as companies struggling for attention in a world cluttered
by an unprecedented cacaphony of advertising look to mega-giants
that control outlets across the electronic and print spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put Fidelity spots in virtually every market in
the country and include specially tailored slots on drive-time
radio, cable television, local broacast affiliates as well as on
national news and popular Internet sites like CBS.com,
CBS.MarketWatch.com, and CBS.Sportsline.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a more synergistic approach to
advertising,'' said Steve Cone, president of Fidelity's customer
and marketing development unit. ``We're getting a very large amount
of exposure out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cone nor CBS would discuss the value of the deal, but
the respected trade publication Advertising Age reported the $50
million figure.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity will have a ``dominant presence'' on each of CBS's
major Web sites, especially CBS.Marketwatch _ an interactive site
with business and financial news _ where Fidelity plans to have
banner advertisements and to sponsor new content, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard and other outdoor advertising through CBS-owned
Transit Display Inc. and soon-to-be acquired Outdoor Systems will
be pumped up in selected cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Fidelity will sponsor a segment on the CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather called ``The American Dream.'' The
four-to five-minute segment, slated to debut Sept. 15 and run each
Wednesday, will be an upbeat feature on people who pursue and
achieve their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity and its ad agency, Hill Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos,
will create ads specifically for ``American Dream,'' Cone said.
Under terms of the sponsorship arrangement, CBS will plug Fidelity
before the segment runs and give the company the first advertising
slot after it ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will be a very uplifting, very positive segment,''
Cone said of ``American Dream.'' ``It's something we can promote to
our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusually close arrangement between an advertiser and a
specific news segment could raise questions among media critics
about Fidelity's influence on the segment's content, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said the segment was conceived
and produced independent of the Fidelity deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not created with Fidelity or any other sponsor in
mind,'' he said. ``It was pre-existing content. This was a concept
Fidelity wanted to wrap itself around. The Evening News has high
standards of objectivity and would not allow any relationship to
interfere with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity said it approached other networks about doing a similar
deal but found CBS the only one able to put together a single
package that provided advertising through all its media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Plus assembled the deal after Fidelity approached the
company in January. Previously, the unit has done similar deals
with Penzoil and Taylor-Made-Golf, but Fidelity is the largest to
date, CBS said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, meanwhile, says it may look for similar deals with
other media giants, like Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably see us doing more of this in the future,''
Cone said.

A SEASON OF JEWISH PAIN AND TWO CLEOPATRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)  
(jt) 
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Whatever else one thinks of that mix of humidity,
pelting rain, heat, chill and solar eclipse that has been styling
itself the English summer this year, one must admit it has
coincided with plenty of startling and disturbing theatrical
images.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an 80-year-old Jewish widow, her pliant, humorous face
icing over as she remembers the murder of her child during the
Holocaust. Here is the ultra-outrageous comedian Lenny Bruce,
babbling and dementedly muttering into his mike as drugs and
paranoia seep through his brain and onto his tongue. And here are
two Cleopatras, one of them played by a male actor, both wigless
and almost hairless as they prepare for death.
</P>
<P>
   Dare one trundle out that critical cliche, tour de force?
</P>
<P>
   That is surely the term for Olympia Dukakis' performance at the
National Theater in ``Rose.'' Martin Sherman's bold attempt to cram
a century of Jewish turbulence into a 150-minute monologue is, I'm
told, likely to transfer to New York this season.
</P>
<P>
   That is also a fair summary of the solo turns that Eddie Izzard
performs in the course of Peter Hall's otherwise disappointing
production of Julian Barry's ``Lenny'' at the Queens Theater in the
West End.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is much to be said for Mark Rylance's
disconcertingly girlish yet often forceful Queen of the Nile at
Shakespeare's Globe, and for Frances de la Tour's caustic
performance of the same role in Stratford. When the second of these
Cleopatras is mourning the death of Alan Bates' Antony, one might
even talk of a de la Tour de force.
</P>
<P>
   `Rose'
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dukakis spends the whole of ``Rose'' perched on a bench with
barely more than a plastic water bottle for company. Never once
does she get up. She is, she says, ``sitting shiva for the dead''
or, as it emerges, grieving for two terrible deaths. Her Rose was
brought up in poverty in the Ukraine, survived in the sewers of the
Warsaw ghetto, met the second of her three husbands while floating
to Palestine on the battered old Exodus, moved to Atlantic City,
had a brief hippie phase, made good as a hotelier in Miami, saw her
son immigrate to Israel and has just heard that her beloved
grandson has done what a Ukrainian soldier casually did to her own
3-year-old daughter during the war. He shot a little girl because
of her ethnic origins, which this time were Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's best-known play is ``Bent,'' which involved the fate
of homosexuals under the Nazis. ``Rose,'' too, is filled with
unostentatious sympathy for outsiders, whether they are people like
the protagonist, with her ripped-up roots and still-intact Yiddish
accent, or present-day victims of what the author clearly regards
as ultra-Orthodox fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing Sherman and his director, Nancy Meckler, is
pretty obvious. Rose's life sometimes seems too exemplary to be
true. Add some convenient coincidences to her tale _ like meeting a
bitter old shopkeeper in the Arizona desert and realizing he is the
spouse she thought she had lost to Dachau _ and Rose could easily
be a piece of potted history rather than a person, a case study
rather than a character.
</P>
<P>
   That this danger is averted says much, both for Sherman's
writing, which compensates for its occasional longueurs with always
lively, often distressing, sometimes hauntingly strange
observation, and for Ms. Dukakis' acting.
</P>
<P>
   She has a tiny, rueful smile that reveals yet conceals much, for
Rose is a naturally outgoing, responsive woman who must repress and
deny in order to stay sane. But still there are moments when her
emotional camouflage fails her; breathlessness strikes; her head
slumps, her face turns blank; you can almost feel the permafrost
beneath the surface, the Siberia in her soul. And since the only
body movement she allows herself is the raising or twisting of the
shoulders, hands or eyebrows, her command of Sherman's intimate
epic is surely extraordinary. If you think that sedentary bravura
is a contradiction in terms, this should change your mind.
</P>
<P>
   `Lenny'
</P>
<P>
   It might not matter that Julian Barry's ``Lenny,'' first seen on
Broadway in 1971, is a dramatic mess, for its subject was a mess,
too, and sometimes a self-indulgent one. Again, there is nothing
innately wrong with presenting Lenny Bruce's story as a series of
memories free-associated between the comedian's appearances on an
obscenity rap before a wearily reproachful New York judge. But do
facial masks and other such surreal effects genuinely enrich or
enlighten? Why the graphically staged nude encounter with the
stripper who became Bruce's wife? Why so many minor or minimal
supporting characters, requiring so much doubling and trebling by
the actors. As biography, the play feels sketchy and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Izzard is alone at the mike, the dramatic clutter seems
irrelevant. True, he is plumper than Bruce, who was wispy; and
where Bruce slouched and twitched, he tends to snake and sinuously
undulate. True, the comic routines that have made Izzard famous in
Britain are more surreal, less socially aware and politically
scathing than those that gave Bruce his American notoriety. But at
some essential level the connections between the two men are
greater than their differences. Izzard has acknowledged Bruce as
the pioneer of his own brand of intelligent, offbeat stand-up
comedy, and here offers his slapdash, subversive forefather a
wonderfully accomplished filial tribute.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night he kept the audience rapt with several of
Bruce's trademark numbers: the outing of the Lone Ranger as a
closet homosexual; the car crash that leaves one mutilated victim
wanting to have sex with the nurse he sees walking through the dead
and dying; the appearance in St. Patrick's Cathedral of Christ and
Moses, complete with a retinue of lepers, while an uncaring
cardinal grandly denounces poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But Izzard gives us not only Bruce's nerve but his nerves. At
the end, he is the figure I myself saw in 1964 in Greenwich
Village: gray-faced, shattered, incoherently obsessed with the
arrests and court cases that were bankrupting him, not very funny,
and, I suspect, already overdosing on the drugs that were to kill
him two years later.
</P>
<P>
   The performance catches not only Bruce's sly mischief and
abrasive charm but also his ramshackle despair. And if it doesn't
fully explain why Eric Bogosian calls him ``St. Lenny, who died for
our sins,'' an essentially moral figure whose denunciations of
hypocrisy and puritanism turned the squares into a lynch mob, it is
hardly Izzard's fault.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The house lights go up for the famous number in which Bruce used
ethnic slurs to describe audience members; yet Barry omits the
attacks on the patronizing white liberalism that the comedian
thought even more racially damaging. Again, we get several examples
of Bruce's distaste for sexual repression, but virtually nothing
about his hatred for capital punishment and war, his belief that
the executions of Eichmann and the California convict Caryl
Chessman, and (more provocatively) the Holocaust and the bombing of
Hiroshima were equally evil. If the aim of the play's revival is to
prove that Bruce is still a topical voice, what would better
fulfill it than giving the redoubtable Izzard the chance to repeat
Bruce's most telling catch phrase: ``Thou Shalt Not Kill means just
that''?
</P>
<P>
   `Antony and Cleopatra'
</P>
<P>
   As the artistic director of the replica of Shakespeare's Wooden
O that opened south of the Thames three years ago, Mark Rylance is
clearly not a man to shirk a challenge. But in tackling the female
half of ``Antony and Cleopatra'' he has taken as tricky a leap
across the gender gap as a stunt rider across the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Egyptian queen fears she will be hauled in chains to
Rome and end up seeing ``some squeaking Cleopatra'' parody her on
the stage. True, the role itself would originally have been taken
by a boy of 13 or 14. But how adequately can some Jacobean Mickey
Rooney have embodied the ``infinite variety'' of Shakespeare's most
fascinating female character? In any case, Rylance is a mature
actor _ and whoever claimed that a tenor Cleopatra was more
authentic than one whose voice had not yet broken?
</P>
<P>
   When Rylance is skipping and twirling about the Globe stage in
his curly black wig and cute shepherdess' frock, the show of
flirtatious girlishness seems pretty self-conscious. But when he
gets the chance to display pique or scorn or dangerous rage, he
catches the character's volatility and, more interestingly, a comic
side often neglected by actresses all too aware that they are
performing an immortal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Rylance's Cleopatra gamely struts about in
platform shoes to demonstrate to her kowtowing court that her love
rival, Toby Cockerell's notably tall Octavia, is dwarfish by
comparison. She is funnier and still more formidable in her
encounters with the messenger who brings the news of Antony's
marriage. No wonder the poor wretch shivers at her final, healing
offer to give him her glistening bracelet, for he has not only been
kicked, bitten and menaced with a knife but also told that he will
get molten gold poured down his ``ill-uttering throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, comedy is not, of course, sufficient. The problem is that
Rylance, though often radiating an unaffected sweetness, fully
embraces neither the sexual bond with Paul Shelley's Antony nor the
pathos and majesty of the play's ending.
</P>
<P>
   Giles Block's all-male production doesn't altogether help here,
for the lifting of the dying hero up to Cleopatra's monument is
inadvertently hilarious, with the captured queen of the Nile and a
big, beefy Charmian hauling at the rope as if they were
energetically raising the mainsail on some unwieldy galleon.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the opening-night audience clearly found it tough to
continue suspending its disbelief in a male heroine, for, fairly or
unfairly, there was still the odd giggle when Rylance removed his
wig _ to reveal a bald, scrofulous scalp beneath _ replaced it with
a pharaoh's shimmering band and made an honorable stab at a regal
death.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, no sniggers when Frances de la Tour did
much the same for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Indeed, her whole
performance had been moving toward the moment when, stricken by
Antony's death and her own capture, she sat in a skullcap before a
mirror, making up a face that suddenly looked blanched, ravaged and
old. At that moment her Cleopatra was revealed as a woman for whom
looks, life, even love have largely been a piece of brilliant
play-acting. Hers is a wry, wary queen, always more in control of
her emotions than she likes to pretend, and more impressively
partnered than Mark Rylance is by Shelley's overgenial Antony.
</P>
<P>
   Right from this production's mildly shocking opening, when he
lifts a bleary face from between Ms. de la Tour's knees, Alan Bates
makes it clear that Antony is no longer the power that he was and,
what is more, that he knows and feels it. Again and again, under
Steven Pimlott's direction, he tries to recover himself, and again
and again a combination of age and sottishness pre-empts him.
Partly as a result, some of the comedy is missing, but the pathos
and even some of the tragedy are there.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what is sadder than the fading bravado of a
once-charismatic roue? Or than the attempts of an exhausted woman
to sustain her mystique? At Stratford that is a lot clearer than at
the Globe.

 &HT;    Outlaw sniper rifles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sharp-shooting rifleman has long been canonized in American
mythology. The war for independence supposedly was won, in part,
because the British insisted on marching in formation, while the
wily colonials hid behind rocks and trees, firing their muskets to
pick off the enemy one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiersmen like Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone were legendary
marksmen. From Gary Cooper playing Sgt. York to Audie Murphy
playing himself, Hollywood has often turned the country boy who
could hit a running rabbit at 100 yards into the man whose skills
with a rifle made him a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder then, that in a nation awash in guns, the
.50-caliber sniper rifle has become one of the most coveted weapons
among American gun enthusiasts. It promises armor-piercing
firepower and accuracy that allows it to hit a target a mile away.
If you've got about $6,000 or so to spend, you can get it through
your local gun dealer. Or if you want to shop around for a bargain,
you can check out the ones offered over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But more than showing the power of an American myth, the
popularity and easy availability of this weapon shows the level of
an American madness: Our tolerance for guns and our resistance to
reasonable regulation of their sale and possession.
</P>
<P>
   Like other rifles and long guns, the .50-caliber sniper rifle is
exempt from most of the minimal restrictions placed on handguns. An
18-year-old can buy one. And the armor piercing ammunition that has
been banned for use in handguns can be legally purchased and used
in rifles. Congress has refused to treat the .50-caliber sniper
rifle any differently from any other long gun since it began
circulating among civilians in the 1980s. Even pleas from the
Secret Service _ justifiably concerned that the weapon made
protecting the president more difficult _ went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups argue
that concern about having the sniper rifle in civilian hands is
unfounded. They say the weapon is too expensive and too large to be
of use to criminals and the other people we worry about. The sniper
rifle, they say, is much more likely to wind up with the well-off,
responsible gun aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FBI says it has tracked at least 17 incidents in
which suspected criminals had .50-caliber sniper rifles. The weapon
has been found in the possession of drug dealers and terrorists.
Clearly, ownership of this gun is not and will not be the exclusive
domain of gun hobbyists. And the more sniper rifles in circulation,
the more likely that some of them will fall into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills dealing with .50-caliber sniper rifles are part of the
renewed push to get gun control legislation through a Congress
aroused by the recent string of shootings across the nation. One
would ban civilian possession of the gun outright. The other would
ban the sale of armor-piercing ammunition for the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Banning both the weapon and the ammunition is what's called for.
We don't need this kind of firepower on our streets. But at the
very least, we shouldn't allow the sale of ammunition that makes
this rifle more dangerous, especially for law enforcement officers
and public officials who are subject to the threat of
assassination. The .50-caliber sniper rifle can make the president
_ riding in an armored limousine _ as vulnerable as those British
soldiers marching across open fields.

 &HT;    Suit over Jewish star likely to end
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Now that a student in Gulfport, Miss., is allowed
to wear his Star of David necklace to school, the American Civil
Liberties Union likely will abandon its lawsuit against the
district that banned the Jewish symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrison County School Board on Monday voted to lift the ban
on the necklace, which resembles a local gang symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pretty much resolves the issue,'' said David Ingebretsen,
head of the Mississippi chapter of the ACLU. ``It's likely we will
withdraw our suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, school board members voted unanimously to prohibit
high school junior Ryan Green from wearing the necklace because
they said it would give gang members the right to wear their
six-pointed stars. Gang symbols are strictly forbidden on school
grounds in the Gulf Coast district. The ACLU, along with Tom Green,
Ryan's father, filed for an injunction Friday in federal court to
prevent the board from enforcing its policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake, that's it,'' said Randy Williams, president
of the school board. ``The decision to ban the Star of David was
strictly a safety decision, and we never considered the religious
implications or that we were denying the student his first
amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began two weeks ago when Ryan Green wore the
Star of David to the first day of classes. Green's grandmother gave
him the necklace over the summer. A teacher noticed its resemblance
to a local gang symbol and told him he could not wear it to school.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the board members decided to let Ryan Green wear
the necklace because they realized religious freedom is more
important than fear of gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real victory for the Green family,'' Ingebretsen
said. ``But it's a shame they had to go through this ordeal to get
his religious rights restored.''

   Defense Secretary George Robertson, 53, who is leaving the

peer with the title of Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, the village on
the Hebridean Island of Islay where he was born. His elevation to

   Kommersant, one of Moscow's most respected daily newspapers,

QUAKE SURVIVORS FEAR DISEASE THREAT, DESPITE ASSURANCES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ Medical experts say the chances of an epidemic
sweeping Turkey are slight. But in areas hit hard by last week's
earthquake, many survivors are panicked by the stench of rotting
corpses, the government's distribution of surgical masks, and local
newspaper reports of cities under quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of last week's quake, which killed nearly 18,000
people and left hundreds of thousands homeless, have been besieging
medical care units, looking for vaccinations against infectious
diseases like cholera and typhoid fever, and stocking up on
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming and asking for a special vaccination that can
cover all kinds of infectious diseases, but what they really want
is something that can give them back their happiness,'' said Sahika
Yuksel, a psychiatrist working in a clinic in Adapazari.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the region hit by the quake is completely without
running water and electricity has not yet been fully restored. For
many living in makeshift tent camps without proper toilets or
washing facilities, the threat of killer diseases seems real.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish newspapers have run reports _ false ones, as it turned
out _ that some of the areas hit hardest by the quake were put
under quarantine. People have started walking around their now
rubble-strewn cities with masks covering their noses and mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what might break out, we must protect ourselves with
whatever we can,'' said Sukru Atar, 52, wearing a green surgical
mask as he rummaged through a pile of donated clothing in
Adapazari.
</P>
<P>
   But international health experts say the chance of cholera,
typhoid fever or plague epidemics are low as long as basic sanitary
measures are taken, like providing clean water and reminding people
to wash their hands and stay away from feces.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish authorities have been distributing bottled water to
people in the quake region and medical workers have gone around and
explained to people the need to take sanitary measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see in some areas they have resumed collecting trash.
. . . It's spotty but it shows a level of capacity to deal with the
problem and that the system is coping,'' said Steve Catlin, leader
of the disaster assistance response team for the US Agency for
International Development, or USAID.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say panic after such disasters is common _ it
happened after the quakes in Mexico, Los Angeles and Armenia _ but
epidemics much less so.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists from the US Centers for Disease Control have
been scouring Turkey to asses the health risks in the wake of the
earthquake and so far they have not found evidence of a possible
outbreak of killer diseases, USAID officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always concern after a disaster about disease . . .
but I have reviewed the records of earthquakes over the past 25
years and it's very, very rare to have an epidemic, virtually
unheard of,'' said Eric Noji, an epidemiologist with the World
Health Organization sent here to evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The report Tuesday of what might be the first case of typhoid
fever was sure to increase panic, however.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli doctors working in the city of Adapazari, where
thousands are without homes or running water, Tuesday hospitalized
a Turkish soldier showing signs of typhoid, including diarrhea and
fever. But they said he could have a different infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it is typhoid it's not a big deal, you have it in
America and in Israel. . . . We have antibiotics for this type of
thing and it's not a problem to bring in more medicines right away
if we need it,'' said Carlos Gruzmann, a doctor at the Israeli
field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal authorities, meanwhile, have been spreading lime
around collapsed buildings, but the fear of infection has led some
workers to keep on spraying the lime, even over people walking down
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably creating a respiratory problem more than
alleviating any contaminationa,'' said USAID's Catlin. ``In
general, bodies don't pose a health risk.''

 &HT;    Georgia Tech receiver credits mom for stardom
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ask Dez White whom he credits for helping turn his
football fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech receiver caught just 10 passes as a high school
senior in Jacksonville and none as a Yellow Jackets freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as a sophomore, White had 46 receptions for a
school-record 973 yards and nine touchdowns, including five
touchdown catches of 50 yards or more. He also had 1,655
all-purpose yards, including a 100-yard kickoff return against
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The All-America candidate doesn't brag about his turnaround. And
he doesn't give the credit to head coach George O'Leary or
receivers coach Stan Hixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, my mother has been my inspiration,'' White says.
``She instilled in me such a strong work ethic that I couldn't help
but keep working on getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been driven in me by my mother from the beginning. I
don't tell her enough how much I love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Desiree White, an insurance auditor who also worked as a
beautician and financial consultant to put her son, Edward Dezmon,
and daughter, Christalyn, through the expensive, private Bolles
School in Jacksonville, gushes when told about her son's praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a sweetie,'' Desiree White said. ``He really does love
our family, and he shows it. When he comes home from school, he
doesn't go anywhere. He just wants to be with all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers aren't the most impressive thing about Dez White.
And they aren't what impress his teammates most about one of the
premier receivers in college football and a contender for the
Biletnikoff Award.
</P>
<P>
   In one spring practice this year, White went into motion during
a goal-line drill, lined up right, then came back toward the middle
and made a fantastic block. The wipeout of the defensive end
allowed a teammate to score and brought shouts of joy and slaps on
the back from quarterback Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``People block for me all the time when I get out in the open
field,'' White said, ``so I like to return the favor every chance I
get.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a speedy _ although his 40-yard-dash time is a closely
guarded Tech secret _ and now sure-handed wide receiver tough
enough to cut back and block big defensive ends _ and humble enough
to warm his mother's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dez White is the type of guy who, if he drops passes, he will
stay after practice,'' Hamilton said. ``He's the type of guy you
want to go to war with, because you know he will be there.
Everything with Dez White is the total package.''
</P>
<P>
   This preseason, White and the No. 11-ranked Yellow Jackets have
attracted plenty of attention. For White, it surely will continue.
When he lines up, more than one defensive back certainly will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   He is comfortable with the attention, because he knows that it
should open the field for speedy receivers Kelly Campbell and Kerry
Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do whatever it takes to help this team win,''
White said. ``If that means a reduced role for me, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Desiree White, who would not let Dez play sports in high school
when his grades were not up to her standards, is proud of her son's
success. But that's not what gives her the most joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a football family,'' said Desiree, whose brother,
Adrian White, played nearly 10 years in the NFL. ``But I'm not a
football mom. With Dez, I'm really most proud about how he has held
on to his Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves football, and if he reaches his (NFL) goals, that's
great. But just knowing he has a relationship with the Lord is
enough for me.''
</P>
<P>

DODGERS, ANGELS: DOG DAYS INDEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital) Today's well-rested edition of The Sporting Muse
(ital):
</P>
<P>
   Short of Kevin Brown suffering a career-ending injury, perhaps
tearing a rotator cuff while toweling off after a game, there
doesn't appear to be anything left to dog the Dodgers for the
balance of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros has been shopped on the open market and discounted
like extra linen at a white sale. Raul Mondesi's fan base has
turned on him after he turned on Dodger management. Davey Johnson
has worn that ``what-the-hell'' look on his face so much that it
has become his regular appearance. And G.M. Kevin Malone is still
talking.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a situation that could sustain the Dodgers'
embarrassment through the postseason and into spring training. That
would be the New York Mets winning the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the regret if Mike Piazza gets a World Series ring with
the Mets. As bad as The Trade was at the time, this would make it
worse. It would also show what a non-issue those leadership and
chemistry debates were while he was here.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the despair if Bobby Valentine, one of the most
disingenuous people in baseball, gets the Mets a title, thereby
giving credibility to Dodger-for-life Tommy Lasorda's Hall of Fame
comment that he'd hire Valentine to manage a team.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets winning the World Series would be proof that things can
always get worse. ...
</P>
<P>
   Could they? Yes, and for multiple reasons. The Mets play the
best defense in all baseball, have the deepest bullpen, and are
pounding the ball. Their bullpen is strong despite the absence of
John Franco, with Armando Benitez, Turk Wendell and Dennis Cook
tag-teaming opponents.
</P>
<P>
   And seven of the eight regulars in the lineup entered Tuesday's
game hitting .300 or better. The only guy under .300 is defensive
whiz Rey Ordonez (.263). Edgardo Alfonso has 20 home runs and 87
runs scored. John Olerud has 15 homers and 75 RBI. Piazza is at 30
and 97, and Robin Ventura, who several teams passed on, has 28 home
runs and 101 RBI. Oh, and ex-Dodger Roger Cedeno leads the N.L. in
steals (58).
</P>
<P>
   The only area the Mets are subpar has been starting pitching,
with none of the regulars stepping up as an ace. But postseason
play often brings out the best in struggling pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the competition to consider. It helps the Mets a
great deal that the Atlanta Braves must deal with postseason
psychological issues. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'd comment at length on the Angels situation, but it appears no
one cares, and that includes the players and owners.
</P>
<P>
   If they did care, then the players wouldn't have let their angst
about Terry Collins' methodology get the best of them. They also
wouldn't have spent so much time back-biting each other. They've
all bitten more than Marv Albert and Mike Tyson combined.
</P>
<P>
   If Disney cared, they wouldn't have let reports about a sale go
by without comment. All this trauma may have come from different
places, but it afflicts the fans most of all. Why should they care,
and why should be they be the only one? ...
</P>
<P>
   That said, I expect Bill Bavasi and Collins to both get
launched, along with several regulars who will be replaced by
cheaper and younger talent. By next June, Mo Vaughn will feel more
like a day-care operator than a first-baseman. ...
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson reportedly will play a game for a Swedish
professional team this fall. This could make one shudder about
another comeback attempt, but it makes me wonder how different
things might have been if we knew as much about AIDS and HIV in
1991 as we do now.
</P>
<P>
   Magic is only 40, and he was just 32 when he made his HIV
announcement in November of 1991. In the last half of 1999, we've
come to know that HIV isn't necessarily a death sentence, that its
transmission is not capricious, and that physical activity is a
plus in its containment.
</P>
<P>
   If HIV education of '99 had been in place eight years ago,
Johnson likely would have continued his NBA career. Every move of
the organization since has been related in some way to Magic's
retirement, from coaching to personnel decisions as well as his own
aborted comebacks as a player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson still plays, maybe Mike Dunleavy doesn't split. Maybe
the Lakers challenge the Bulls and Michael Jordan for their second
and third titles, rather than Portland and Phoenix. Maybe the
Lakers and not Houston play for NBA titles during Jordan's baseball
break.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Lakers ease into a transition period with Magic and
James Worthy and don't feel the need to play free agent roulette
and sign Shaquille O'Neal. If it's the Lakers and Magic beating
Orlando in the 1995 finals, maybe the career of Shaquille O'Neal
takes a different turn. ...
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of three years of courageous play by Jeff
Hostetler, the Raiders haven't had a credible quarterback since Jim
Plunkett took off his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   That has rarely been as vividly true as today. The Raiders have
surrounded themselves with numerous suspects since the Jeff George
experiment failed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is Bobby Hoying, acquired from the Eagles Tuesday for
a draft pick. The former Ohio State quarterback attempted 224
passes last season, and he did not throw one touchdown pass, which
has to be some kind of perverse NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying joins a camp that includes 40-year-old Wade Wilson and
well-traveled veteran Rich Gannon, late of K.C., who has been
handed the starting job on the strength of his mobility. The
Raiduhs decided they needed a quarterback with legs since their
offensive line is among the league's worst.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates read like the waiver wire. There's last year's
part-time starter Donald Hollas; Pat Barnes, who was MVP of the
World Bowl; left-hander Paul Justin; Redskins washout Heath Shuler;
former Heisman winner Andre Ware, who couldn't win a starting job
in the CFL; and rookie free agent Scott Dreisbach, who was being
considered for the starting job before breaking his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Take this QB quandary and add a mean schedule and you have a
potential disastrous year. The Raiders open at Green Bay and at
Minnesota, and after a home game versus Chicago, they play at
Seattle, Denver, at Buffalo, and host the N.Y. Jets and Miami. Can
you say 1-7? ...

FED BOOSTS INTEREST RATES AS IT CONTINUES TO BATTLE INFLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve Board nudged up interest rates
for the second time in less than two months Tuesday in a continuing
battle to keep a hold on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers, in an anticipated move, raised the federal
funds rate _ the interest rate banks charge one another for
overnight loans _ by a quarter of a percentage point Tuesday to 5
1/4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a more surprising move, Fed officials also hiked the
less-frequently used discount rate by a quarter of a percentage
point to 4 3/4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in more than four years the Federal
Reserve has pushed up the rate it charges banks for loans.
</P>
<P>
   The ``increase in the federal funds rate, together with the
policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally
in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly
diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward,'' Fed
officials said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials also maintained an official neutral stance on
interest rates, meaning they have no preference either for raising
or lowering interest rates in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors interpreted the Fed's statement to mean
policy-makers have no plans to raise rates any further this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've basically said short of any drastic change in the
market place this is ... the last dose of medicine the market place
needs,'' said David Lapin, president of Lapin &AMP; Wigginton Asset
Management, a Houston-based money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   But when confronted with the Fed's unexpected move on the
discount rate, Wall Street dithered.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after leaping into record
territory Monday on expectations of a rate hike, bounced up and
down after the announcement Tuesday before finally closing at
11,283.30, down 16.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index, however, rose 33
points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 2752.48.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds rose on the Fed news Tuesday, with 30-year bonds climbing
23/32, or $7.19 per $1,000 face amount, to close at 102 22/32.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed picture,'' said Bryan Jordan, economics adviser
for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ``Basically,
(Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan is saying `It's OK to have a rally,
just don't let it get out of hand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks _ led by Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and Bank One Corp. _
quickly responded to the Fed's actions by raising their own prime
lending rates a corresponding quarter of a percentage point to 8
1/4 percent. The prime is a bank's benchmark rate, used to
determine rates on everything from car loans to credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Home mortgage rates, while not directly tied to the federal
funds rate, are also strongly influenced by Fed actions. Mortgage
rates, which have risen significantly over the last year in
anticipation of Fed moves to tighten the money supply, have
actually eased in recent weeks as lenders became more persuaded
Tuesday's moves would be the final increases of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision Tuesday to raise the federal funds rate
followed a similar quarter point increase June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had applauded that move, persuaded at that time the
Fed's decision to adopt a neutral bias toward interest rates
indicated there would be no further rate increases this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But then a few weeks later, Greenspan used his scheduled
testimony on Capitol Hill to disabuse investors of that notion. By
issuing a strongly worded warning about inflation, Greenspan
telegraphed the Fed's likelihood of raising rates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee is slated to convene three
more times before the end of the year, with its next meeting
scheduled for Oct. 5. But Fed watchers are becoming increasingly
more confident those sessions will be non-events.
</P>
<P>
   While recent inflation numbers gave Fed officials some cover for
Tuesday's strike against inflation, the data have been less than
compelling. Last week, the Labor Department said its seasonably
adjusted Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in July after
remaining flat the previous two months.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists believe, even without Fed intervention, the
economy will slow over the next few months, as we edge closer to
the Year 2000 and business managers become increasingly concerned
about the so-called Millennium Bug. Many business managers are
expected to delay purchases to wait out the change in the calendar
and ensure they don't run into computer troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of a Y2K problem, more than the reality of a
Y2K problem, will be enough to slow down the economy as we go into
next year and everybody sits on their hands,'' Lapin said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wachtel, market analyst for Prudential Securities in New
York, believes Fed policy-makers _ armed with the data they had _
had to struggle to raise rates Tuesday. The Y2K problem will make
it even more difficult to raise rates down the road, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Fed officials have raised rates a total of half a
percentage point this year, they still have not taken back all of
the ground they gave last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut interest rates three times in 1998 for a total of
three quarters of a percentage point in a successful attempt to
shield the U.S. economy from the effects of an economic crisis that
was ricocheting around much of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``With financial markets functioning more normally, and with
persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming
and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease
required to address the global financial market turmoil of last
fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary,
economic expansion,'' the Fed committee said.
</P>
<P>
   By raising rates Tuesday, Fed policy-makers ignored the pleas
from parties ranging from he Small Business Survival Committee to
Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In raising rates again, the Fed committed a blunder,'' Forbes
said in a statement. ``Yet, the insulated governors of the Federal
Reserve Board will not pay for this mistake. U.S. farmers, business
owners, and home buyers will suffer the severity of this
miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Regalia, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
argued the effect of a quarter of a percentage point on the economy
will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest impact is probably psychological,'' Regalia said
in a prepared statement. ``While a quarter point increase can price
marginal homebuyers out of the market and make buying on credit
slightly more expensive, it is not likely to bring the spending
Juggernaut to a halt.''

CELLUCCI NAMES STAFF CHIEF TO HEAD MASSPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a move designed to rid Massport of its ``frat-boy''
culture, Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday chose his chief of staff,
Virginia Buckingham, to be the agency's new executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci personally rounded up votes on Massport's board to
install Buckingham, who will become the first female to run the
port authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's important to have a strong leader at that
agency,'' Cellucci said. ``We are basically sending our best person
over to that agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham will lead Cellucci's controversial push to build a
new runway at Logan Airport, a plan that has touched off protest
from community groups and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has told Buckingham, who is returning from a maternity
leave, to clean out the old boy culture he believes set the stage
for last week's agency-funded Boston Harbor party cruise that cost
director Peter Blute's his job, sources said. That boat trip
featured heavy drinking and swimsuit-clad young women.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham, 33, who also served as a press secretary and chief
of staff for ex-Governor William F. Weld, said she is prepared to
change the heavily male culture at the authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am used to dealing with the old boys network having worked
in politics for some many years,'' said Buckingham, in a telephone
interview with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   She said said power is shifting in Massachusetts politics with
the election of more women, like Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift and
State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of culture change can be made at Massport,''
Buckingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham began her political career as an intern to Governor
Michael S. Dukakis, and joined Cellucci as a campaign aide in the
1990 campaign. She has been one of the most powerful figures at the
Statehouse for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci told Massport board members Buckingham will bring
stability to the agency, which has been the target of ridicule
since photographs of Blute's cruise were published in the Boston
Herald last week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the runway plan, Massport is trying to improve
regional aviation, moving to take over the city airport in
Worcester and increase traffic to Hanscom Air Field in Bedford. The
authority is also involved in critical waterfront development
questions, with control of key parcels of land as Boston's
construction boom continues.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing, Cellucci brushed aside suggestions that
Buckingham is too young and inexperienced to run the multi-billion
agency. He said she can provide leadership and rely on the
``experts'' at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham is believed to be the youngest person ever to serve
in the job. Cellucci said Buckingham would have the unanimous
support of the seven-member board when it meets later this month.
Her salary has not been set but Blute was paid $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Buckingham at the State House, Cellucci said he is
giving the $92,000-a-year chief of staff job to Steven O'Neill, his
chief secretary. In his current post as chief secretary, O'Neill
has been primarly in charge of patronage hiring and managed the
administration's relations with the Democratic-controlled
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's selection of Buckingham caught the political and
government worlds by surprise. Massport board leaders, including
its chairman Mark Robinson, had talked last week of whitling down a
list of candidates quickly, but Buckingham's name was not among
those mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But administration sources said Cellucci wanted to make a move
that appeared decisive and bold, to quell criticism that his
administration is drifting.
</P>
<P>
   They said the governor is convinced Buckingham's political
skills, strong ties to the administration and public relations
background make her the perfect person to turn Massport around.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut native and Boston College graduate who is married
to District Court judge David Lowy, Buckingham has been at the
center of key decisions during most of the Weld and Cellucci
administrations. She earned a reputation as a tough inside player
whom Weld and Cellucci heavily depended for political advice and
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Weld appointed Lowy a judge as one of his final appointments as
governor.

<P>
   HAINES JUNCTION, Yukon Territory _ Tribal leaders and
archeologists announced here on Tuesday that hunters have
discovered the well-preserved body of an ancient man, partially
uncovered by a melting glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a cloak sewn of small pelts, probably of arctic
ground squirrels, the body of the ancient man was found on a
melting glacier flank that was strewn with his belongings: a finely
woven, broad-brimmed hat, a stout walking stick, a spear, and a
leather pouch containing edible leaves and the remains of a fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comparable to the Alps find,'' said Al Mackie, the lead
archeologist here, referring to the well-preserved body of a
prehistoric hunter found in an Alpine glacier in 1991 that is
thought to be at least 5,000 years old. ``In the Alps, it was a
person crossing a glacier who ran afoul of the weather and died
there. He also had with him a tool kit. The condition of the body
was comparable.''
</P>
<P>
   The body here in northern Canada could have lain frozen in the
blue ice for hundreds or thousands of years, Mackie said. There was
no sign of European tools, which were first brought to the area
where the body was found, about 50 miles from the Alaskan coast, by
Russian traders 250 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found on Aug. 14 by three Canadian sheep hunters
who were hiking through the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial
Wilderness Park in British Columbia, almost 1,000 miles north of
Vancouver. It is now in cold storage in Whitehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed since the time when the ancient hunters lived
here. At the close of the 20th century, this wild region remains
one of North America's roughest and most unforgiving terrains.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, about a dozen planes from Canada and the
United States have searched in vain for an American pilot and his
plane that vanished somewhere between Eastern Alaska and
Whitehorse, which is about 100 miles east of here. In Whitehorse,
surgeons on Monday implanted metal eye sockets in the face of a
local man whose face was smashed over the weekend by a grizzly
bear.
</P>
<P>
   A torrent of water melting from the glacier and a chance
encounter exposed the remains, one of the hunters, Bill Hanlon,
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably walked by it the day before,'' he said of their
hike above the tree line, a tundra plateau at about 6,500 feet.
``We went up on the ice and started to pick up pieces of wood,
which seemed kind of strange given the elevation we were at.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We noticed carvings in the pieces of wood, and they were
notched,'' continued Hanlon, a high school teacher from southern
British Columbia. ``We looked closely at what looked like a
backpack. You could see the actual threading and the holes where it
was sewn together.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Ward, one of his hunting companions, recalled discovering
the body: ``I looked at it through my binoculars and I saw it _ it
looked like the National Geographic pictures we'd been seeing for
years. I could see a lot of tattered bucked leather, and pieces of
fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon added, ``Being hunters and finding a hunter _ because all
the tools he was carrying lead us to believe he was a hunter, same
as we were _ that was kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally excited by the find, Mackie, the archeologist, said,
``You don't just have a few tools lying around _ you have got the
person. You have the potential for learning what he had been
eating, where he had been traveling, what his health history was.''
</P>
<P>
   Another archeologist, Knut Fladmark, of Simon Fraser University,
said on Tuesday from Vancouver, ``There have been very few
discoveries of human soft tissue of this age in North America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Announcement of the most recent discovery was delayed for 10
days as archeologists consulted with elders of the
Champagne-Ashihik First Nations, the 1,140-member tribe that has
legal control over historical artifacts discovered in the park,
part of their ancestral homeland, which straddles British Columbia
and the Yukon Territory.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier discovery with possible tribal ties led to a battle
between the tribe and scientists. A skeleton found on the shore of
the Columbia River near Kennewick, Wash., in 1996, thought by
scientists to be more than 9,000 years old, led to a challenge by
the Umatilla Indian tribe. Its leaders claimed the bones as those
of a tribal ancestor under a 1990 law to protect Indian graves and
tried to block scientific study of the bones.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, tribal elders here say they favor scientific study
of the remains and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elders did say that they felt it was as important to get
as much information as possible from this person _ that's kind of
an endorsement of scientific study,'' Ron Chambers, a tribal member
of the park management board, said at the tribal headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Waving a hand toward an arctic squirrel robe on a wall and a
wooden spear on a table, he added, ``Some of the material that this
person was carrying is some of the things from our elders that we
display right now _ this throwing stick, the robe.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Strand, the tribe's heritage resource officer, said that
she believes that the ancient man caught in the ice was a tribal
ancestor. ``According to stories recorded by our elders, we have
been here since time immemorial, since when animals could speak to
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who also serves on a local search and rescue team,
noted another link between the present and the ancient past. ``He
appears to have fallen, wedged upright in a crevasse,'' he said.
``That remains the biggest danger in the area today. In the
springtime, there is old snow hiding these crevasses -- you are
walking along, and you are gone.''

RED SOX BEEF UP PLAYOFF BID WITH LEFTIE MERCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Finally, the pieces fit. The Red Sox snapped up
veteran lefthander Kent Mercker Tuesday and fully expect him to
play a role in their bid to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, 31, became the latest addition to a Red Sox rotation
that has been plagued all season by injuries and high earned run
averages. He was obtained from the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange
for a pair of minor leaguers, pitcher Mike Matthews and catcher
Dave Benham, neither of whom is considered a prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker is expected to join the Red Sox Wednesday; he has been
penciled in to the Friday start that ordinarily would have been
Bret Saberhagen's spot. The veteran righthander Saberhaqgen is on
the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Aug. 18, because of
shoulder soreness.
</P>
<P>
   With St. Louis this year, Mercker had a 6-5 record and a 5.12
ERA in 25 appearances (18 starts). Since July 1, he was 4-2 with a
3.99 ERA. He last worked Saturday, going 5 1/3 innings and taking
the loss in a 7-4 setback to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very versatile pitcher who has the ability to be
effective as a starter and a reliever,'' said Sox general manager
Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mercker went 11-11 in 30 starts, leading the St. Louis
staff in victories, but had a 5.07 ERA. His career log is 60-58.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker is a well-traveled product of the Atlanta Braves system.
He spent six years in Atlanta after coming up for good in 1990. He
was traded to Baltimore after the 1995 season, and from there moved
on to Cleveland in 1996, Cincinnati in 1997, and St. Louis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He has postseason experience, having pitched for Atlanta in the
1991 and 1995 World Series. Sox manager Jimy Williams, who was a
coach on those Braves teams, knows Mercker well and thinks highly
of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, he's been pitching good lately,'' said
Williams. ``He throws fastball, curveball, and changeup. I haven't
seen much of him lately but he knows how to pitch. With the Braves,
I saw him pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers and be part of
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker pitched six innings of a no-hitter Sept. 11, 1991,
combining with Mark Wohlers and Alejandro Pena in a 1-0 victory
over San Diego. On April 8, 1994, he threw a no-hitter to beat the
Dodgers, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been used a lot of different ways,'' said Williams. ``But
primarily he's a starter. I feel like we got a good arm. It's a
good addition for our club.''
</P>
<P>
   The rotation now is Pedro Martinez, who pitched Tuesday night,
Mark Portugal, Pat Rapp, Tim Wakefield, and Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox haven't officially made room on the roster for Mercker,
though they put some wheels in motion Tuesday. Marino Santana was
moved from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day list, making room
on the 40-man roster. The likely suspect to be dropped from the
25-man major league roster is Japanese righthander Tomokazu Ohka,
who was recalled from Pawtucket Monday to replace Brian Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker will be the first lefthander to start for Boston this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for good pitchers, it doesn't matter if it's
a right or lefthander,'' said Williams.

KANSAS SCHOOLS FACE BALANCING OF EVOLUTION AND CREATIONISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., La., Texas)  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Sitting at their students' desks two days before
the start of the new school year, four high school biology teachers
here were hashing over the vote of the Kansas Board of Education,
earlier this month, to delete virtually any mention of evolution
from the state's recommended science curriculum and its
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' reaction was as swift as it was unanimous: They
would continue to teach science as they have been, with the support
of their superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get evolution here,'' said Elaine Pardee, who teaches
at Washburn Rural High, where the science classroom walls are lined
with various animal skeletons that, by their very appearance,
testify to the evolutionary theory of a common ancestor among
mammals. ``We're not going to cheat our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 miles away in Pratt, a small town west of Wichita, the
local school board president, Willa Beth Mills, had a very
different reaction to the state board's action. She applauded it,
and said she hoped that it would lead to elements of creationism _
or at least a heavy dose of skepticism about the theory of
evolution _ being injected into her district's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's relegated to Sunday school,'' Mrs. Mills
said. ``If you present the material to students with critical
thinking, and they come to you with a paper supporting creationism,
or arguing against evolutionary theory from a creationist point of
view, you should accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   These are emotionally volatile and exceptionally confusing days
for the teachers, principals and parents of Kansas' public school
children. Two weeks after the board's vote, which was widely
interpreted as establishing an important national beachhead for
creationists, the theater of battle has shifted to the state's 304
public school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Because the adoption of standards in science or any other
subject cannot be dictated under state law, it will be up to each
district to decide whether to follow the lead of the state board,
which periodically issues guidelines suggesting what should be
taught in the state's classrooms. What the state board can control
is the content of its standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 2000-2001 school year, the state tests in 7th-
and 10th-grade science will not ask students questions about the
theories that multiple species have evolved from a common ancestor
and that the universe originated in an explosion, or big bang _ two
ideas that have come under sharp attack from those who have found
more persuasive evidence of the world's origins in religion.
Questions about ``micro-evolution,'' defined in the state
guidelines as changes in an organism's ``structure, function or
behavior,'' will remain.
</P>
<P>
   At issue for Kansans is nothing less than reconciling two
central explanations of life: the Darwinian theory that man and
monkey gradually branched off from the same family tree millions of
years ago as they adjusted to a changing environment, a contention
heavily rooted in scientific evidence, and the creationist belief
that a divine being has been pulling the biological levers of the
universe, including the origin of man as described in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The debate concerns more than what public school students should
learn about each point of view, more than a decade after the
Supreme Court said states could not compel the teaching of
creationism. For science teachers, the state board's
characterization of evolution as a theory shrouded in doubt _ no
matter the supporting testimony of fossils and genetic codes _ has
raised worries about whether other theories at the heart of
science, like those concerning atoms or even gravity, will come
under attack next.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take away evolution because it's a theory, you can't
teach science,'' said Steve Angel, a chemistry professor who is the
president of the Auburn-Washburn school board in Topeka and a
member of the committee of experts whose standards were rewritten
by the state board. ``All of science is theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate Republican, has been among the most
vocal critics of the state board, whose 10 members are elected and
are outside of his control. He argues that the six-member majority
that rewrote the standards in just a few hours, ripping out whole
pages of a document that had been drafted over nearly two years by
a committee of 27 scientists and science teachers, did so to make a
rhetorical splash at the behest of the conservative wing of the
state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 304 locally elected school boards who have the
option to tell the state board to go jump in the lake,'' said Mike
Matson, a spokesman for the governor. ``The governor is confident
the overwhelming number will.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a group of parents, the school board in Pratt,
a town of about 7,000, arranged a presentation earlier this month
from a local wildlife biologist about a controversial book titled
``Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological
Origins.'' The book _ first printed in 1989 by Haughton Publishing
of Dallas and since sold to public schools in more than a dozen
states, including Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Texas _ suggests that
``intelligent design,'' as engineered by an ``intelligent agent,''
may be a more compelling explanation than biological evolution for
the wide variety found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   While the book stops well short of identifying God as the
designer, as creationists might, critics, including those
affiliated with the National Association of Biology Teachers, have
condemned the book as little more than an artfully worded end-run
around the constitutional separation of church and state in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But to Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of
Wildlife and Parks who presented the book to the Pratt board, ``Of
Pandas and People'' and its theory of intelligent design provides
the perfect antidote to those teachers who might be tempted to
teach evolution as an undisputed fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the theory as saying, `It is legitimate to have, as part
of the tool kit for science education, the option to say that the
things we see in nature may be designed or could have been
designed,''' he said. ``It doesn't speculate or presuppose that
there is a creator or miracles involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mills, the board president in Pratt, said the book is now
under consideration for inclusion as a supplement to the district
science curriculum, which was already being rewritten at the time
of the state board vote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administrators in Pratt said that Mrs. Mills' position on the
standards has not prompted anyone to tell district officials they
would pull their children out of the school system.
</P>
<P>
   In Auburn-Washburn, one of five school districts in Topeka, the
board president, Steve Angel, and the superintendent, Howard
Shuler, have pledged that there will be no change in the district
science standards in response to the state board vote. Shuler said
that only one parent of the district's 5,000 students had written
to criticize the district stance, and that none had threatened to
pull children out of district schools.)
</P>
<P>
   Ninth-grade biology students at Washburn Rural will be
introduced to Darwin and the theory of evolution over three to five
days in the spring semester, after they have gone through rites of
high school biology like dissecting a rat and a sheep's heart.
</P>
<P>
   The textbook used in the ninth grade, ``Biology: Visualizing
Life,'' published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston of Austin, Texas,
explains that ``monkeys, apes and humans are examples of primates''
and argues that ``primates most likely evolved from small,
insect-eating rodentlike mammals that lived about 60 millions years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pardee, who has taught biology at Washburn Rural for nine
years, tells her students that the theory of evolution ``is the
most currently acceptable scientific explanation that we have,''
but adds that her students ``don't have to believe it.'' What she
insists is that her students ``know what the facts of the theory
are.'' Though they might be able to pass the new state science test
without such knowledge, she says, the material is covered in the
standardized science test for the district and the advanced
placement test in biology.
</P>
<P>
   When the inevitable question from a student arises about
creationism, usually couched in a biblical reference, Kevin
Bordewick, another biology teacher at Washburn Rural, said he cuts
off such discussions, believing they are better suited to a
humanities class or the home. ``It's between them, their parents
and whatever God they believe in, if any,'' Bordewick said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bordewick and his colleagues at Washburn said they would
never introduce their personal beliefs into the classroom, other
teachers said drawing such a thick line was nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Depenbusch, who teaches 7th- and 8th-grade science in
Skyline, in Pratt County, says she believes that ``evolution and
creation don't have to be mutually exclusive,'' and that ``God's
plan of creation can include evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Depenbusch says she does not ``present the science of
creationism in my classroom,'' she says she was not opposed to
telling her students about her beliefs, as long as she prefaced her
comments ``very heavily'' with a warning that the ideas were her
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution is a theory,'' she said. ``We can present several
different theories to help them think. Let them do some thinking
with the help of their families. Then let them make up their own
minds.''

IN A FIRST, SYPHILIS OUTBREAK TRACED TO CYBERSPACE CHAT ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what health officials believe is the first
time a disease cluster has been traced to cyberspace, the
Department of Public Health here has tracked an outbreak of
syphilis cases to an America Online chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Six men who have contracted syphilis in the last three months
have traced their last sexual encounters to partners they met
through an America Online member-created chat room called San
Francisco Men 4 Men (SFM4M), city health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a new development for public health officials who
traditionally define an affected group by the members' physical
proximity or relation, and poses a question for the electronic age:
When does the right to online privacy yield to public health
issues?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the syphilis-infected men know their multiple partners
only by their cyberspace nicknames, or ``handles.'' America Online
would not divulge the identities of the chat room visitors, so the
only way to contact the scores of sex partners the
syphilis-infected men met online has been through e-mails and
postings in the chat room itself.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of men known to be infected so far is small,
and their infections were identified early and are fully treatable,
they represent a sizable number of the 17 syphilis cases reported
in San Francisco this year, and the cluster has provided a
frightening glimpse of a potentially larger public health risk, as
more and more people use cyberspace to find sex partners, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the six men who met partners through the America Online
chat room, which is open only to AOL subscribers, a seventh local
man who contracted syphilis since June said he met his sex partners
through an Internet relay chat room, known as an IRC. Together, the
seven men have identified 99 sex partners in the last three months
_ one man had 47 partners _ and five of the seven men have HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when both syphilis and AIDS cases are at an all-time
low in San Francisco, as in the rest of the country, officials are
now worried that these seven syphilis cases may indicate a new
venue has been created for unsafe sex. The core group of
individuals using cyberspace to meet multiple, anonymous sex
partners is the same as that which would use bathhouses or highway
rest stops or other pick-up venues to engage in unsafe, potentially
dangerous sex, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, the director of the
sexually transmitted disease unit at the public health department.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did five of the infected men expose numerous partners
to HIV, but because syphilis causes open sores that increase the
vulnerability to HIV, their partners are at greater risk of
contracting the virus, Klausner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discovered that the Internet chat room is becoming an
important sexual network,'' he said, ``and one that poses
particular challenges for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the health department traced the cluster of syphilis cases
to the chat room, Klausner said he called America Online to find
out how the department could contact all the exposed sex partners,
as well as those men who might have contact with the exposed men.
</P>
<P>
   America Online does not give out the names of subscribers as a
matter of policy, unless presented with a court order or in the
event of special cases like a physical threat, said Rich Damato, an
AOL spokesman. Asked whether the syphilis cluster constituted a
physical threat, he said, ``I would not want in this case to
speculate what would constitute a physical threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Klausner said that the health department considered trying to
subpoena the names of the chat room subscribers, but ``there wasn't
a large enough public health risk to warrant that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a move applauded by Internet privacy advocates,
America Online put the health department in touch with Planet Out,
a worldwide online service for homosexuals based in San Francisco.
Tom Rielly, chairman of Planet Out, said that the service used
e-mails, volunteers and its own Web site (www.planetout.com) to get
the word out in the last two weeks to the chat room users who would
be more likely to read mail from the service than from other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did first was send a letter out to the chat room names
the health department obtained from the men who were infected,''
Rielly said. Then, he said, Planet Out posted instant messages to
people who were in the chat rooms. It also trained 60 volunteers to
visit the chat rooms and talk to people there, and posted
information on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 99 men who were directly exposed to syphilis, 33 have
been tested. Klausner estimated that perhaps another third had
contacted their own doctors, while the remaining still do not know
that they were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Mulligan, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a policy organization in Washington that advocates
protecting privacy rights in the cyber-age, commended the health
department and Planet Out for how they handled the situation. By
contacting people online, the agency has a chance to reach not just
infected participants, but also those who may be at risk, she said.
``They're saying, `Look, be careful,''' Ms. Mulligan said.
``They're potentially reaching a much broader audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Westmoreland, a senior policy fellow and public health
expert at Georgetown University Law School, also applauded the
effort. ``I've never heard of a case like this _ ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point, he said, is that the health department
cannot be certain that infected participants will return to the
chat rooms. But on the whole, he said, warning people in chat rooms
is an easier way of contacting people and more efficient than
traditional door-to-door methods. ``This is a new way of defining
the community,'' he said. ``It's not defined by physical geography,
but by the use of cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   (A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta said that while she had never heard of
another cluster traced to cyberspace, she could not be certain that
others simply were not reported.)
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of chat rooms based in San Francisco alone,
Rielly said, including 100 to 1,000 chat rooms geared to gay men
and lesbians. Only perhaps six or seven of those chat rooms are
expressly for people who want to meet sex partners, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Klausner of the health department said that since Planet Out
began its outreach, the numbers of men coming into the department's
sex clinics for testing has nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   But in a SFM4M chat Tuesday afternoon, several participants
pooh-poohed the notion that the syphilis cluster is anything to
worry about. One man, who identified himself as a doctor, said
incorrectly that the cluster represented a total of seven cases in
San Francisco in seven months, rather than just over two months.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that ``sex is dangerous no matter how you cut it.''

<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ With the stadium thumping to chants of
``East! East! East!'' the boys from Toms River Tuesday afternoon
stormed into the semifinals of the Little League World Series in
quest of a second consecutive championship.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey team defeated Brownsburg, Indiana, 3-1, before
15,300 fans at Howard J. Lamade Stadium, completing a 3-0 sweep of
the United States bracket and advancing to the U.S. championship
game on Thursday. The winner of that game plays the international
bracket winner for the Little League championship on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The three other American teams had varying chances of advancing
to the national championship game. Phenix City, Ala., (1-1) would
clinch the spot with a victory over the Boise, Idaho, (0-1) in the
late game Tuesday night. But Boise would advance by winning Tuesday
night and then again on Wednesday against Brownsburg (0-2).
However, if Boise won, then lost, three teams would finish with 1-2
records, and tie breakers would determine the other finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Yabucoa, Puerto Rico (2-0) closed in on
clinching a berth in Thursday's international final with a 3-1
victory over Osaka, Japan. Jorge Colon hit a two-run homer in the
bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   By winning on Monday and Tuesday, Toms River had virtually
assured itself of a spot in the U.S. championship game. So Tuesday
was a chance for the boys to have some fun, and judging from the
smiles and giggles when power-hitter Steve Bernath entered the game
to pitch the final inning, that's exactly what they did.
</P>
<P>
   Between the fifth and sixth innings, Mike Gaynor, the Toms River
manager, walked into the dugout and asked, ``Who wants to pitch?''
His team was leading by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve raised his hand with a big smile on his face,'' Gaynor
said. ``I said, `Go ahead, it's all you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bernath strutted out to the mound, barely able to contain
himself. He tossed a few warm-up pitches, most of them several feet
off the plate. But that didn't bother him. Bernath, who
occasionally pitches during the regular season, struck out the
first Indiana batter be faced. The next batter grounded out.
Bernath walked the next two batters, then allowed them to advance
on a wild pitch. He shrugged, gathered himself, and struck out the
last batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like throwing,'' said Bernath, whose nickname is
Big Unit because his gangly frame reminds people of the
Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson. ``I had been begging him all week to
let me go out there and pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve's mom, Nancy Bernath, added: ``I saw him walking out to
the mound. I didn't know what was going on. I was very nervous,
probably more nervous than he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Fontenelli, usually the shortstop, started Tuesday's game
for Toms River and earned his first victory of the post-season. In
four innings, he allowed four hits and no walks and struck out
eight. Until Tuesday, he had only pitched two innings for Toms
River. Eric Campesi pitched the fifth inning and allowed the only
run on three hits.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, it seems, was to pitch Fontenelli Tuesday so that
Campesi, the team's No. 2 starter, could pitch in the U.S.
championship game. By throwing Campesi on Thursday, the team will
have Casey Gaynor, the staff ace, rested for Saturday's World
Series title game, assuming Toms River wins on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River took a 2-0 lead on two hits in the second inning. The
Indiana pitcher, Zach Mills, got himself in trouble after walking
the first two Toms River batters he faced. With Fontenelli and Dave
Cappello on base, Bernath hit an infield single to load the bases.
Then Mike Casale drove in the first run with base hit up the
middle. Casale's hit sent the hundreds of Toms River supporters
into a tizzy. They stood and chanted, ``Beast is back! Beast is
back!''
</P>
<P>
   On that play, however, Bernath overran second base and was
thrown out by the Indiana catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River got its second run that inning when Mills threw over
his catcher's head, allowing Cappello to score from third base. The
No. 8 and No. 9 hitters, Chris Cunningham and Zack Del Vento, then
struck out swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Mills struggled with his control again in the third inning,
walking the first two batters he faced. He was replaced by Collin
Steele, who had been playing shortstop. Steele got Jeff Burgdorff
to hit into a double play, but Campesi baited the Indiana first
baseman into throwing the ball to third. The throw bounced and got
away from the third baseman and Campesi trotted home to make the
score 3-0. &QL;

 &HT;    Photos of executed inmate may sway decision in electric chair
debate
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida's seven-decade tradition of
electrocuting its murderers may have fallen Tuesday onto the
shoulders of a single man _ a man who just last month wrote that
use of the electric chair ``continues to walk the edge of
constitutional propriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Fred Lewis, who joined the Florida Supreme Court nine
months ago, could be the swing vote on a divided panel that once
again must decide whether putting enough electricity to light up a
small neighborhood through a human being violates the prohibition
against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful,'' anti-death penalty lawyer Marty McClain said
after the hour-long oral arguments that included the first-ever
appearance of photos of an executed man. ``It's just too ghastly.''
</P>
<P>
   A retiring of the chair could translate into a years-long delay
in executions in Florida as lawyers for Death Row inmates scramble
to challenge lethal injection, which, under a 1998 law, would
automatically become the state's method of execution should the
electric chair be ruled unconstitutional. ``Capital punishment is
the law of the land,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said.``We'll adapt to whatever
the Supreme Court decides, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not say a single word through Tuesday's hour-long oral
arguments, even as the two confirmed electric chair foes on the
court and a third colleague peppered lawyers with questions.
Observers were left with his single written pronouncement on the
matter: a July 1 concurring opinion that, for the time being,
approved the electrocution of Orange County courthouse killer
Thomas Provenzano.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discussion and debate will be never ending so long as this
mechanism exists,'' Lewis wrote of the electric chair. ``And
although we must have stability in legal precedent to respect the
rule of law, we must never fear confrontation with precedent when
the factual underpinnings of such precedent lack validity.'' The
high court narrowly retained the electric chair in 1997, but
advised in its majority opinion that lawmakers switch to lethal
injection. Among the 38 states where capital punishment is legal,
Florida is the largest of four that rely solely on electrocution
for executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since that ruling, the court has acquired three new members.
One, Peggy Quince, is a former assistant attorney general who once
argued to uphold death sentences. Observers generally believe she
will vote to keep the chair, along with justices Major Harding and
Charles Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Harry Lee Anstead and Leander Shaw, meanwhile, have
consistently opposed the electric chair. New justice Barbara
Pariente has raised concerns about the chair, as well. Her July 1
opinion said the court's recent approval of the electric chair was
based on the understanding that condemned inmates did not suffer
conscious pain and that the Department of Corrections follow
established protocol regarding voltage and current.
</P>
<P>
   Those guidelines were attacked Tuesday as justices delved into _
and at times tripped over _ a discussion of elementary physics.
</P>
<P>
   McClain accused the state of giving mere lip service to the
protocol of delivering 9.5 amperes of electricity at 2,300 volts
when its own experts knew the equipment could not guarantee those
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the words they think this court wants to hear,''
McClain said, and then ignore the published figures when it comes
time to actually putting an inmate to death.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Richard Martell apologized to the
court for misstating the electrical levels in the past, but said it
was based on the information that was provided to him. He countered
McClain's contention that condemned inmates felt pain with a
reminder of the point of executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking his life, and he's paying the ultimate
punishment,'' he said. ``It's not going to be pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments did not seem persuasive, though, to Shaw and
Anstead.
</P>
<P>
   Anstead pointed to McClain's photographs of murderer Allen Lee
Davis, whose nosebleed-marred execution on July 8 spurred the
latest inquiry into the chair. ``Can you hold that photo up to the
State of Florida and say this is what we want to do?'' Anstead
asked Martell. ``They look like they're right out of some horror
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Martell told the court that the electric chair was originally
invented as a humane method of execution, to which Pariente asked:
``And what century was that?''
</P>
<P>
   Provenzano is scheduled to be electrocuted Sept. 14, so the
court will likely rule before then, unless justices grant the
killer a hearing to determine his sanity. In that case, a ruling on
the chair could be delayed.

REACTION: WITH NO SURPRISES, TRADING IS RESTRAINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FED-RATES and graphic) 
(pr) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Financial markets got what many investors interpreted
as an all-clear signal from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, as the
central bank indicated that its latest quarter-point rate increase
would be enough to slow economic growth and keep inflation in
check. But the reaction was subdued in the stock and bond markets
because many had anticipated the Fed's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are seeing this as a `we're done for now' kind of
signal,'' said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. He and other Fed watchers said, however, that
they could not rule out a third rate increase by the Fed. The first
in this series came on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy remains very strong, and the balance of inflation
risks continues to edge higher,'' Berner said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas R. Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities, agreed. He said that stocks with high price-earnings
ratios and those dependent on discretionary consumer spending, like
autos and retailers, would be vulnerable if market sentiment swung
back to the view that a third rate increase was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after jumping 199.15 points to
a new high on Monday, dropped 16.46 Tuesday, or two-tenths of one
percent, to 11,283.30. The Dow was down 10 to 20 points before the
Fed announced it was raising its interest rate target, the federal
funds rate, on overnight loans between banks, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the news, the Dow fell just over 100 points before
rebounding. The Wall Street saying that covers such selling on what
would be considered good news is ``buy on the rumor and sell on the
news''; that is, buy when you expect the news to be good so that
you can take some profits when the news is good.
</P>
<P>
   The other major stock indexes finished higher, though they
dipped temporarily after the announcement. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
index of 500 stocks closed up 3.28, or two-tenths of one percent,
to 1,363.50; it was up about 3 points before the announcement by
the Fed at 2:15 p.m. The Nasdaq composite index ended at 32.80, up
1.2 percent, at 2,752.37; it was up about 25 points before the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32, to
102 24/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
dropped to 5.93 percent, from 5.98 percent on Monday. The bond was
up about 13/32 before the announcement. The price of the two-year
note, which is more sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, rose
3/32, and the yield dropped to 5.58 percent, from 5.64 percent on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was little changed on the news, falling against the
Japanese yen and the euro. In emerging stock markets, the benchmark
Mexican and Brazilian indexes fell after the announcement but were
still up for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The signal from the Fed policy makers came in the statement
released by the Federal Open Market Committee after Tuesday's
meeting. ``Today's increase in the federal funds rate,'' the
statement said, ``together with the policy action in June and the
firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over
recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising
inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a far more positive signal than the Fed gave when it
made the June rate increase. The statement released then said the
committee ``recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it
must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence,
of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP;
Associates, warned against assuming that the Fed would not raise
interest rates again before the year is over. He said one
indication was that the Fed had also raised its discount rate, the
rate charged on loans to member banks, a quarter of a percentage
point, to 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that this was an aggressive move, indicating that the
Fed was worried about inflation, so another rate rise should not be
ruled out. In past episodes of raising rates, Crandall said, the
Fed had waited longer and until the spread between the discount
rate and the target federal funds rate was much wider before
raising the discount rate.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall also pointed to a very small word change in Tuesday's
statement from the June statement. In both, the Fed referred to the
three quarter-point rate cuts that were made last fall in an effort
to calm the financial turmoil around the world after Russia
defaulted on its debt and devalued its currency.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the federal funds rate in June, the Fed said that
much of the financial strain from the fall of 1998 had eased and,
therefore, ``the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's statement, the Fed said, ``The degree of monetary
ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of
last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary
economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said that the change from ``full degree'' to just
``degree'' could be taken as a signal that the Fed would take back
all those rate cuts, which means one more rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   When you just have the Fed's statement to go on, he said, ``that
is the sort of fine distinction that you can't ignore.''

AS KEY REBELS AGREE TO A 50-MAN SIGNING PROCEDURE, CONGO PEACE
ACCORD ADVANCES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The Congo peace negotiations took a major step
forward on Tuesday when two rival rebel factions agreed to sign a
cease-fire document already approved by other combatants in the
yearlong civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But like almost everything else about the war, the compromise
between the two groups is decidedly complex. Rather than have two
or three rebel leaders sign the peace document, as originally
envisioned, the compromise calls for some 50 rebel officials from
all three rebel groups to sign.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, rebel officials said, they plan to
travel en masse to Lusaka, the Zambian capital, to sign the peace
accord that was drafted there on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel officials themselves conceded the plan's awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's really a good compromise,'' said Moise
Nyarugabo, vice president of the main rebel group, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy. ``This can just help us move in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some outside analysts wondered if the compromise was
actually aimed at peace or merely at making the accord so unwieldy
that the deal would fall apart and the fighting would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a complicated thing,'' said Hannelie de Beer,
senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South
Africa. ``I want to see if it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has been a major source of instability in central
Africa, and peace has been elusive, in part because there are so
many warring parties with so many different aims. At least six
countries, including Congo itself, are fighting, along with the
three rebel groups that are trying to overthrow President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, all the parties agreed in July in
Lusaka to sign the peace accord. It calls for an immediate
cease-fire, for the outside nations to withdraw their troops, for
international observers to monitor the peace and for a national
``dialogue'' inside Congo among Kabila, the rebels and other
opposition leaders to decide the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, squabbling broke out among the rebel
groups at the peace conference and they walked away without
signing.
</P>
<P>
   Nyarugabo's group refused to sign if its former leader, Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba, also signed. Wamba dia Wamba was ousted in May and
set up his own faction in the northeastern city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the third rebel faction, Jean-Pierre Bemba, said
he would not sign if Wamba dia Wamba did not.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dispute was on some level an internal struggle
among the rebels, the failure to sign also reflected disagreements
between Rwanda and Uganda, two of the outside countries fighting in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   They are normally close allies. But Rwanda has given military
support to the Congolese Rally for Democracy, and Uganda has
supported Wamba dia Wamba's breakaway faction and Bemba.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two countries _ and their forces on the
ground _ erupted a week and a half ago when Ugandan and Rwandan
soldiers fought a three-day battle in Kisangani in which at least
200 people were reported killed.
</P>
<P>
   After so much bloodshed, the leaders of the two nations met last
week and pledged to put pressure on the rebel groups they support
to sign the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement appears to be the fruit of that meeting.
Officials from Rwanda and Uganda praised the deal, saying it
resurrected the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they are going to sign, that gets rid of one
stumbling block,'' said Hope Kivengeri, the spokeswoman for the
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. ``Then we have to get down to
the nitty-gritty. We're really confident that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise calls for all 50 original leaders of the
rebellion to sign the document, not only Wamba dia Wamba and his
replacement in the Rally for Democracy, Dr. Emile Ilunga. The
compromise, Nyarugabo said, makes the point that Wamba dia Wamba
holds no special status above any other of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``To allow Wamba to sign alone is to accept the creation of
another faction,'' Nyarugabo said. ``We said, `Let all the founders
sign, because Wamba is one of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba said on Tuesday that he would accept the
compromise, though with some bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``One probably needs to be angry,'' he said. ``Because it wasn't
necessary _ this delay and loss of human lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bemba, who has already signed on his own, said he also was
content with the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really good news,'' he said. ``If we can agree among
each other and put Kabila out smoothly, it's OK''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and the leaders of the nations that support him,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, have signed the accord. But the
signing is only the first step in what will be a long and difficult
path toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the most pressing question is whether extremist
forces from the Hutu ethnic group, fighting alongside Kabila, will
lay down their arms in their struggle against the Tutsi-led
government in Rwanda, which borders on Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The outside nations _ each rumored to be taking away a piece of
Congo's vast wealth, in diamonds, oil, gold, timber or cotton _
will have to learn to do without those riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of problems in the air,'' Ms. de Beer said.
``What's going to be very important is continued international
attention, even after everyone signs.''

 &HT;    Pratt's `buffet' of talent has firms lining up for a seat
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The vultures have landed in northern
Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Major aircraft and engine manufacturers have roosted in the land
of Pratt &AMP; Whitney, hoping to snap up workers. Several ran large
advertisements in Sunday's Palm Beach Post with lists of job
openings.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were ABB Power Generation Ltd. of Baden, Switzerland;
General Electric-Harris Railway Electronics of Melbourne; GKN
Westland Aerospace of Tallassee, Ala.; Gulfstream Air of Savannah,
Ga.; Lockheed Martin Electronics &AMP; Missiles Division of Orlando;
Motorola, with plants in Boynton Beach and Plantation;
Siemens-Westinghouse Power Corp. of Findlay, Ohio; Westinghouse
Commercial Nuclear Fuel Division of Columbia, S.C., and Williams
International of Walled Lake, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are looking for gas turbine engineers, aircraft
and engine mechanics, electrical engineers, physicists, and systems
and software engineers. But they also are hiring accountants and
human resources specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt spokesman Tim Burris said the company isn't surprised.
``When you are making the changes that we're making, you expect
this sort of thing, especially when you have talented employees,''
Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt gave these companies the incentive they needed by
announcing a major restructuring this month that will include
moving 2,500 to 2,800 engineers involved in the development of jet
engines for the military from Florida to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second move by Pratt this year. It sent 600 engineers
to Connecticut, starting in April.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the companies _ Siemens-Westinghouse and Williams
International _ are holding open houses this week at the Embassy
Suites Hotel in Palm Beach Gardens, in Pratt's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feast. They want to visit the free Pratt &AMP; Whitney
buffet,'' said one engineer who expects to be moved to New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the engineers at Pratt &AMP; Whitney, if you have a choice
between Florida and Connecticut, you choose Florida. If the choice
is between Connecticut and the rest of the country, you might pick
the rest of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are lining up for a crack at Pratt's engineers
this week because employees at the plant on Beeline Highway in
northwestern Palm Beach County will learn if they will receive an
invitation to move with the company. Letters have already begun to
go out.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorsky Aircraft, Pratt's sister company, is moving its
helicopter plant. Pratt and Sikorsky are subsidiaries of Hartford,
Conn.-based United Technologies Corp. Sikorsky hasn't said whether
it will move its employees.
</P>
<P>
   New Piper Aircraft in Vero Beach is expanding its operation and
has openings. It employs 1,100 people in the manufacture of small
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about a hundred openings, ranging from customer
service to engineering to manufacturing,'' said Patrick Faller,
director of human resources. ``I have been approached by both Pratt
and Sikorsky employees.''
</P>
<P>
   One group of employees won't have to worry _ 200 computer
programmers and operators who were transferred to Computer Sciences
Corp. from Pratt in May.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based company will move them to other offices.
CSC has 700 offices, with 21 in Florida including two in Miami and
one in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key message is that everyone will have jobs, but it may
involve relocation,'' spokeswoman Mary Rhodes said.

TEEN WHO FLED TO ISRAEL WILL PLEAD GUILTY TO U.S. MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Maryland teen-ager who has been the subject of a
long extradition battle between the United States and Israel has
agreed to plead guilty to the gruesome murder of another Maryland
youth and to accept a 24-year prison sentence in Israel, state
prosecutors in Maryland announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said they were angry over the plea agreement
between Israeli authorities and the 19-year-old defendant, Samuel
Sheinbein, who fled to Israel days after the charred, dismembered
body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was found in an empty garage in September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli embassy in Washington confirmed the latest, and
perhaps final, twist in a murder case that has frustrated U.S.
prosecutors and outraged lawmakers in both the United States and
Israel, who alleged that Sheinbein had manipulated the legal
systems of both countries in an effort to avoid punishment for an
especially grisly crime.
</P>
<P>
   An embassy spokesman acknowledged that Israeli prosecutors had
settled on a plea bargain with Sheinbein that would require him to
plead guilty to murder at a court hearing on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors in Montgomery County, Md., where the murder
took place, had sought the extradition of Sheinbein to the United
States, where he could have faced life in prison without parole if
convicted of the strangling death of Tello, who was 19. Prosecutors
here would have been unable to seek the death penalty because
Sheinbein was a minor at the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry supported the
extradition of Sheinbein, who was born and raised in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But in February the Israeli Supreme Court refused the request
from U.S. prosecutors, accepting the argument of defense lawyers
that Sheinbein could claim Israeli citizenship by virtue of his
father's birth in 1944 in what was then British-occupied Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Sheinbein's hasty departure from the United
States two years ago, Israeli law barred the extradition of Israeli
citizens for trial abroad. As a result of the furor over the
Sheinbein case in Israel, the law has since been changed to make it
possible for Israel to extradite citizens who are not residents.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States does, Israel permits the prosecution of its
citizens at home for serious crimes committed outside its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Eitan Maoz, a lawyer for Sheinbein, refused to comment Tuesday
except to say that developments in the case would be revealed at a
court appearance next week in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor in Montgomery County, state's attorney
Douglas F. Gansler, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the
plea bargain was ``an insult to justice'' because it would allow
Sheinbein to go free on parole in as little as 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an insult that Sheinbein will now be walking free in the
streets of Israel in all probability at the age of 33 years old,''
Gansler said. ``Sheinbein undoubtedly would have served a sentence
of life in prison without parole had he been held accountable
here.''
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors in Maryland have said that, despite the plea
bargain in Israel, Sheinbein would face prosecution if he ever
returned to the United States. There is no statute of limitations
on the case, and Gansler has vowed that the murder charges against
Sheinbein will remain on the books indefinitely. ``There's no
double jeopardy question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's flight to Israel and the refusal of Israeli courts
to extradite him to the United States in the killing of Tello, a
Hispanic youth, raised a furor in Maryland's Latino community and
led members of Congress from the state to threaten cuts in the
$3-billion-a-year U.S. aid package to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Tello's family released a statement Tuesday in response to
reports of a plea bargain: ``The Tello family feels that justice
has not been achieved in this case, that Mr. Sheinbein and his
family have continually manipulated the judicial systems of both
Israel and the United States.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gansler acknowledged that by the standards of the Israeli
criminal justice system, Sheinbein had agreed to a harsh sentence,
especially since he might likely have been shown some leniency as a
result of his youth and his lack of a violent criminal record
before 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a longer term of incarceration than we had been
expecting,'' the Gansler said. ``Once you accepted the fact that he
was not going to be extradited to the U.S., then it's not so
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Israeli embassy, Mark Regev, confirmed that
a plea bargain had been reached. But he cautioned that the
agreement was not final until it had been reviewed and approved by
Israeli courts. ``The courts have the right to accept it or throw
it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler has said that if the trial were held in Maryland, he was
prepared to call as many as 80 witnesses who would weave together
evidence showing that the murder of Tello was a ``thrill kill,''
and that Sheinbein and a friend, Aaron Needle, had plotted the
crime in elaborate, grisly detail.
</P>
<P>
   Needle hanged himself with a bedsheet in a Maryland prison just
before his trial was to start in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently Tello had disrespected Aaron Needle in front of
Aaron Needle's girlfriend,'' Gansler said. ``You couldn't have had
a stronger case. We have DNA evidence. We have fingerprint
evidence.'' He said prosecutors had obtained a handwritten document
in which Sheinbein ``wrote out this recipe for murder, including
identifying the make of the circular saw he was going to use on the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   In court arguments in Israel during the extradition fight,
Sheinbein's lawyers promised that he would admit to the murder if
he were tried in Israel instead of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In a court appearance last month, however, he pleaded not guilty
to murder, although he acknowledged that he had burned and
dismembered Tello's body. The prosecutors in Maryland said they
were shocked by the plea and that it signaled an effort by
Sheinbein to win acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's lawyer, David Libai, a former Israeli justice
minister, told the Tel Aviv court that Sheinbein would not admit to
any role in the strangling death of Tello, leaving the clear
suggestion that Needle was the sole murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's father, Sol, a patent lawyer who arranged his son's
departure from the United States and has joined him in Israel, is
still wanted in Montgomery County on charges of obstruction of
justice and hindering a criminal investigation. He has said that he
feared for his son's life in a U.S. prison.

GROUP WILL RE-EXAMINE AUCTION TAX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Canada, Calif.)   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Reacting to criticism from the breeders
and buyers of race horses, the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association has announced that it will re-examine the way it raises
money, specifically the 1 per cent tax imposed on the buyers of
horses at auction sales.
</P>
<P>
   The association, created 16 months ago to unify the horse
business, caused a storm recently over its decision to add the
surcharge to the bills sent to people who buy horses at auction. In
a statement on Monday, it said it would appoint a task force to
review its money-raising formulas for its new fiscal year, which
begins next April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stronach, the Canadian industrialist who recently bought
Santa Anita and Gulfstream Park and became the most powerful force
in the racing business, said Tuesday from his office in Toronto:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say somebody else should pay for something. Why
tax the buyers of horses? The key question is: Will it be for the
common good of racing?
</P>
<P>
   ``The NTRA has a noble purpose, but it is going in too many
directions with a sizable budget and overhead. I don't like clubs
where people are appointed; the stakeholders should elect the
directors. And you've got to fix the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Caesar Kimmel, the prominent horseman, said: ``If they have to,
there are many other ways for the NTRA to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA upset many buyers in the booming horse market recently
when it notified them that the tax would be applied to bills at the
September sale of yearlings at Keeneland in Kentucky. Criticism was
also reported from a meeting of the Thoroughbred Owners and
Breeders Association in Saratoga last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Tuttle, vice president for communications for the NTRA,
said that ``some of our marketing programs would be put in serious
jeopardy'' if they were restructured now. But he said that the task
force would be set up to review the association's funding
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC FAVORITE OUT OF RACE
</P>
<P>
   Another NTRA program suffered a blow Tuesday morning when Mazel
Trick, the favorite in Sunday's $1 million Pacific Classic, pulled
up with damaged sesamoid bones during a workout at Del Mar in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic has been billed as the climactic event in
the NTRA ``championship series'' for handicap horses, but the race
has suffered the loss of top horses like Silver Charm, Victory
Gallop and Real Quiet. In their absence, Mazel Trick, with a
four-race winning streak, inherited the favorite's role. He is
trained by Bobby Frankel, who has won the Pacific Classic four
times in the eight years it has been run. But his star was pulled
up during a workout Tuesday morning, and was scheduled for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he passed the three-eighths pole, he took a bad step,''
said Bob Baffert, who trains two of the survivors for the race,
General Challenge and River Keen. ``He pulled up right away, so he
has a chance. General Challenge followed him on the track, and
worked three-quarters of a mile in 1:11, and River Keen went in
1:11 4/5, the best he's ever worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd have to say Malek has the most experience of those who
are left, and it should be his race to win or lose.''

FRESHMEN COMPETE FOR RECEIVING JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcell Allmond was speaking about himself but he might as well
have included USC teammates Kareem Kelly and Steve Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just sat back and watched, I would be bored,'' said
Allmond after a recent Trojan fall camp practice at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Allmond, Kelly and Stevenson who, collectively make
up one of the nation's best freshman receiving groups to spend much
time sitting back this season. And, beginning with the
season-opener Sept.4 at Hawaii, none of them will probably have too
much time to get bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 3 receiver is (basically) a starter,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``The first (five receivers) in our system see a lot
of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the third, fourth and fifth receivers are named
Allmond, Kelly and Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans don't have the luxury to let these guys mature
slowly. Senior Windrell Hayes has established himself as the
Trojans first receiving option and R. Jay Soward, when healthy and
motivated, is a proven threat to score at any time. After that,
though, there's not any experienced reliability and it doesn't help
that junior college transfer Craig Mitchell is having trouble
getting into camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw them in and just go,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually their ability to go or, more directly, go fast
that makes Hackett think the new receivers can help right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to coach a long time to know that they're
fast,'' Hackett said. ``They bring an element of speed to our
perimeter that we didn't have last year.''
</P>
<P>
   No California prep athlete was faster than Kelly last year as
the Poly graduate claimed the state 100 and 200 meter sprint
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else had a 10.3 (100-yard dash guy) at receiver,'' Poly
receiver coach Merle Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond, a St. Paul alum, raced to the state championship in the
110-high hurdles and Stevenson also made his mark in the sprints at
Charter Oak.
</P>
<P>
   On the football field, the speed led to a combined 66 touchdowns
last year as each helped their team reach a CIF Southern Section
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But speed comes in many forms in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``College defensive backs are not slow,'' Allmond said. ``You
find that out right away. They are either one step behind or one
step ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the new receivers has excellent size for the position.
Stevenson is 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, Kelly is 6-1, 185, and
Allmond is 6-2, 180. But trying to best utilize the size and speed
means trying to learn a complicated West Coast offense playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge gap between learning the system in high school
and learning the system here,'' Kelly said. ``They've thrown 200
plays at us in the past couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   For Allmond, it's a lot different than lining up for St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here blind,'' Allmond said.
</P>
<P>
   All three received an early start on their college football
education by attending summer workouts on campus. It was there that
one of them Allmond earned some early respect from a pretty
important guy on campus starting quarterback Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcell really stood out,'' Palmer said. ``He came right in
and got a couple of touchdowns (in 7-on-7 passing games). You can
tell he wants the ball and you can tell he wants to play right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   When camp opened, each of them knew that early playing time was
not only a possibility but a necessity. And that isits
</P>
<P>
   something each would welcome with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it pressure,'' Stevenson said. ``I would call
it a challenge. Early on, they told us it was up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Each has shown moments of promise during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond was one of the offensive stars during the 100-play dress
rehearsal scrimmage on Tuesday at the L.A. Coliseum. He showed
excellent concentration on a 16-yard reception with safety David
Gibson in his face and flashed his speed by getting behind the
defense on a post pattern for a 34-yard score on a pass from
Palmer. Kelly caught two passes for 26 yards and Stevenson had two
receptions for 34 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly may be the most polished route-runner simply because he
was strictly a receiver at Poly. Allmond lined up at different
spots on offense for the Swordsmen and was also a full-time
defensive back. Stevenson played receiver, running back and
defensive back at Charter Oak.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has plagued Kelly is dropsinconsistent hands
</P>
<P>
   . In this summer's Texas-California Shrine All-Star game, Kelly
caught a touchdown pass but he also had several catchable balls
sail through his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make excuses but it was rustiness,'' Kelly
said. ``Until the Shrine practices, I really hadn't caught any
balls since the (CIF) championship game in December. I haven't
dropped too many balls (in camp). I just need to work on that part
of my game to be a complete receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they leave school each will have plenty of opportunity to
show their ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group, I think we can be the best to ever come out of
USC,'' Kelly said. ``We're coming in at the right time. Carson, to
me, is the prototype quarterback. He always puts the ball in the
right spot and makes it easy for a receiver. Carson is the best
thing to happen to me since (former Poly teammate and Stanford
freshman) Chris Lewis.''

BARNETT AIMS TO RE-ESTABLISH COLORADO AS BIG 12 BRUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soft.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Colorado football had become. Finesse football. In
four years under Rick Neuheisel, the Buffaloes had regressed from
the brass knuckles program that won a national championship in 1990
and challenged Nebraska for dominance to a team that couldn't run
the football, couldn't stop the run and didn't win enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK at some schools, but not Colorado,'' wide receiver
Marcus Stiggers, a former Richardson Lake Highlands star, said of
last season's 8-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel left for Washington in early January. His replacement
is Gary Barnett, who was an assistant coach from 1984-91 at
Colorado when the Buffaloes became dominant. At his introductory
Colorado news conference, Barnett made it clear there was a new
sheriff in town. He promised the Buffaloes would visit the old
days. His theme: Return to Dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how soft and finesse-oriented we had become when
I said that,'' Barnett said. ``I had to create a vision. Unless you
have a vivid picture of where you want to go, you won't get there.
You want a standard, and we have one here \Rthe 1990 title\S.
Having done it before really helps. When I say `return to
dominance' around here, everybody has a clear picture of what that
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes probably won't contend for a national championship
this season. But Barnett's return along with a large group of
talented players has Colorado ranked a consensus No. 15 in 10
preseason polls. The belief is that if Barnett can win at
Northwestern, where he spent nine seasons and won two Big Ten
Conference titles by revitalizing a tepid program, he should have
success at a state school like Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was a surprise pick to replace Bill McCartney in 1995.
Neuheisel won 10 games each of his first two seasons and received
notoriety as a New Age coach. He took his team rafting, staged
water-gun and snowball fights and played guitar on stage with Jimmy
Buffett. He was a cool coach.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Buffs went 5-6 in 1997 _ a season littered with
penalties and turnovers _ there were questions about a lack of
discipline. And even eight victories last season didn't quiet the
doubters.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett has set about emphatically answering those questions.
Practices are fast-paced and hard hitting. The winning team in the
spring game ate steak; the losers ate beans. Barnett showed his
team the statistics from the 1989, 1990 and 1991 teams (combined
record: 30-5-2) and compared those numbers with last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very vivid,'' Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   How vivid? From 1989-91, Colorado averaged 289 yards rushing a
game and 36 rushing touchdowns a season while allowing 126 yards
rushing per game and an average of 10 rushing TDs a season. Last
season, the Buffs allowed 147 rushing yards per game and 24 rushing
TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we needed to change our image, and I don't know if we
would have had there not been a \Rcoaching\S change,'' center Andre
Gurode said. ``We've been a finesse team, but now it's a whole new
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I want. I want smash-mouth,'' defensive back
Rashidi Barnes said. ``That's what the team wants. We want to come
up and hit people. As a defensive player, that's what you live
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett had been living for a chance to return to Boulder. When
he left Colorado in 1992 to take over at Northwestern, many of his
colleagues believed he had snuffed out a bright career. But when
the Wildcats reached the Rose Bowl in 1996, Barnett became ``the''
hot coach. He interviewed at UCLA and Georgia. His name was linked
to the Notre Dame opening and the Detroit Lions job. In December
1997, he was interviewed by Texas, a job he said was
``intriguing.'' His name come up as a possible replacement for John
Blake at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   When Neuheisel resigned, Barnett thought he would get the job
after being interviewed by Colorado officials. But the announcement
was delayed when Colorado spent time trying to lure Denver Broncos
assistant coach Gary Kubiak. Barnett even e-mailed Northwestern
players telling them that he would stay in Chicago to honor his
10-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to pull out after \RColorado\S told me that they
were going with Kubiak,'' Barnett said. ``I realized it was a job
that I really wanted. A few days later, I'm out recruiting and get
the message that Kubiak has turned the job down. Things changed I
didn't have control over.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett knows that his yearly candidacy for job openings has
followed him to the Rocky Mountains. So, Gary, is this your last
coaching move? ``I have been asked that, and my answer is `I
certainly hope so.' I get tired of the questions, but I understand
them. I wouldn't have left Northwestern if it hadn't been for
Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett has gone home again. His goal is to take the Buffaloes
on a similar nostalgia tour, back to the days of 10-win seasons,
significant bowl games, national championship hunts and
knock-your-breath-out football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last spring we changed the total approach, and I thought the
kids handled it well,'' Barnett said. ``They were surprised at the
tempo and the physical nature. At the end of the spring, we were
more physical than we had been. We're not a mentally disciplined or
tough team yet. But we're closer to that than we were. We
definitely set a tone. A loud one. We're going to run the football
effectively, we're going to become a physical team instead of a
finesse team.''

RENO AND BRITISH STEP UP MONEY LAUNDERING INQUIRY AT BANK OF NEW
YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal money laundering investigation at the Bank of New
York is intensifying this week as Attorney General Janet Reno and
British authorities stepped up their interest in the effort,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House Banking Committee said it planned to hold
hearings next month on international financial corruption and the
threat to America's banking system from money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue is whether foreign theft has been facilitated by
self-serving banking practices in the Western world, including the
U.S.,'' said Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the banking
committee. ``With regard to the Bank of New York, the question is
whether they were unwittingly duped or were willing facilitators.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question has huge implications for the bank.
But it will take some time for that to be known, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, if a bank is found to have knowingly
laundered money for criminals, federal regulators can revoke its
charter effectively putting it out of business. Even if just one
employee acted without the knowledge of bank management, the
institution could still face severe penalities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the investigation at the bank was publicly acknowledged
last week, the bank has been cooperating with a federal
investigation of its Eastern European accounts since last
September, according to people involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, regulators are questioning whether the bank ever
properly supervised one of its fastest-growing businesses. Billions
of dollars, some of it investigators believe tied to Russian
organized crime, flowed through the bank, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bank conducted transactions with money that came from
criminal activity and it did so knowingly or through willful
blindness, it can be prosecuted for money laundering whether or not
it filed suspicious activity reports,'' said Charles Intriago, a
money laundering expert and publisher of Money Laundering Alert, a
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bank nor any of its employees have been accused of
any wrongdoing. Two senior bank employees were suspended last week
pending the outcome of the investigation. The bank will not discuss
any aspect of the investigation including issues involving its
employees or its customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the bank was compromised by employees
secretly undertaking crimes. But even if that were the case, the
bank could still be in serious legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rule that says that more than one employee needs to
know for a bank to be convicted'' of illegal activity, said
Intriago. ``If the employee acted within the scope of his or her
duties then the institution can be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``An account of this magnitude _ given the area in which the
bank was dealing _ should have had supervisory reviews up and down
the line,'' Intriago said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is said by a person close to her to have a ``personal
interest'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the last few days, two British investigators
arrived in the United States to bolster the FBI's effort, and
Switzerland's banking commission said Tuesday that it is also
cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss law enforcement authorities said earlier this year that
Russian organized crime had been actively laundering money in banks
there and Swiss prosecutors have been investigating allegations of
money laundering involving members of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals close to the Bank of New York investigation said
that the bank began cooperating with the probe at a relatively
early stage, suggesting that much of the most suspect activity
occurred only because the bank left accounts open to observe and
entrap those involved in the suspected laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, huge sums began zipping through accounts at the
bank activity that would total $4.2 billion by March of this year.
This was one month after the bank began cooperating with
investigators, according to officials involved in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Money-laundering is a legal catch-phrase referring to the
criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them
through a sequence of bank accounts so that they ultimately look
like legitimate profits from legal businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key accounts through which money is suspected of
being laundered belongs to a company called Benex, which
investigators believe filtered money for Semyon Mogilevich, an
alleged kingpin of Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Benex's owner, Peter Berlin, is married to Lucy Edwards, a Bank
of New York executive in London. Ms. Edwards reported to Natasha
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, who ran the bank's Russian business from its
New York headquarters. Ms. Edwards and Ms. Kagalovsky are the two
Bank of New York employees who have been suspended. Both women have
declined to comment; Berlin cannot be located.
</P>
<P>
   Benex went into business in London in May, 1998, according to
British corporate records. A month later, in June, 1998, British
authorities, investigating the financial activities of Russian
organized crime, alerted the FBI to suspected money laundering at
the Bank of New York involving Benex. This was the first time the
FBI became aware of the problem, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Republic National Bank of New York, which
actively competed with the Bank of New York for Russian business,
sent a letter to the FBI regarding suspicious money transfers its
handled involving Russian companies and the Bank of New York .
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, the FBI notified the Bank of New York of an
investigation and it was only at this time that the bank filed its
own suspicious activities report with regulators.

 &HT;    Marianne Gingrich claims husband Newt took 'valuable assets'
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING TO (a) General news and (p) National political
categories.)
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt
Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's
assets until their divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition,
Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial
portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further
transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has
already transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation
and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all this came down, she had all the assets,'' Evans said.
``He was so detached from anything that had to do with finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich didn't even have a checkbook, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's counterclaim, filed Aug. 9 in Cobb Superior
Court, is not specific about what assets the former speaker is
accused of attempting to transfer. Her attorney, John Mayoue,
declined to elaborate on the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already
contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the
former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after
1998 GOP election losses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Mayoue has said that Marianne Gingrich is
prepared to thoroughly investigate her husband's personal life and
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce last month, after 18 years of
marriage. Marianne Gingrich immediately served notice that she
wanted to depose 33-year-old Callista Bisek of Arlington, Va., with
whom Gingrich is alleged to have an affair lasting several years.
Bisek works as an aide for the House Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue has convinced Judge Robinson to allow him to take a
video-taped deposition of Bisek. Mayoue has said he intends to
question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt
Gingrich. A date for the deposition has been tentatively set for
Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Tuesday that Newt Gingrich and Bisek ``had a
relationship,'' but declined to define it any further.

A PAIR OF DARING LEAPS INTO CLASSICAL TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By JACK ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two wonderful surprises danced their way across stages this
summer. The choreographers of both took what seemed like foolhardy
risks. Yet, instead of plummeting into catastrophe, both Twyla
Tharp and Trisha Brown managed to soar creatively. Ms. Brown, in
fact, even levitated a dancer. Ms. Tharp wrestled with Beethoven,
and she and Beethoven both emerged with honor.
</P>
<P>
   When she announced the score for the premiere that her company,
Tharp!, staged last month at the American Dance Festival in Durham,
N.C., some music-loving dancegoers must have felt like fainting.
Ms. Tharp set her ``Grosse Sonata'' to Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.
29 in B flat (Op. 106), the ``Hammerklavier.'' This is precisely
the sort of imposing score that dance-composition teachers warn
against, for its formal intricacy and emotional urgency can make
choreography look irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tharp relishes challenges. Indeed, inspired
choreographers sometimes produce wonderful works by sheer daring.
Back in the '30s, to the horror of music critics, Leonide Massine
created exciting ballets to Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony (``Les
Presages'') and Brahms' Fourth Symphony (``Choreartium''). As
revived by the Joffrey Ballet and England's Birmingham Royal
Ballet, respectively, these works retain their power.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the director of the Hamburg Ballet, John
Neumeier, has found Mahler's fervent but lengthy symphonies
perfectly suited to his own creative temperament. Jerome Robbins
successfully choreographed Bach's ``Goldberg Variations'' for the
New York City Ballet. Molissa Fenley, in ``State of Darkness,''
used Stravinsky's clamorous ``Sacre du Printemps'' _ a score that
most choreographers would tackle by filling the stage with hordes
of people _ for a striking solo about a woman warrior. And the
Dutch choreographer Hans van Manen once successfully created a
ballet to one movement of the ``Hammerklavier.'' Ms. Tharp had
precedents to encourage her.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a dance to the entire ``Hammerklavier,'' which lasts
about 40 minutes? What chutzpah! Nevertheless, from the moment Ms.
Tharp matched Beethoven's bold opening statement by having Andrew
Robinson and Thomas Lund swoop Gabrielle Malone across the stage,
one knew all would go well. There was a joyous solo on point for
Stacey Caddell, a former member of the City Ballet. Ms. Malone, a
modern dancer, was not on point. Yet ``Grosse Sonata'' did not
treat ballet and modern dance as rivals. Rather, their techniques
provided Ms. Tharp with a wide range of movement possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   She explored ways in which Ms. Malone and Robinson could cling
together. Beethoven's theme and variations sequence prompted
unexpected choreographic slowings and speedings, as if time were
stopping and restarting. And, to Beethoven's mighty concluding
fugue, Ms. Tharp repeated and wove together some of the significant
movements she had introduced earlier. So much happened that it was
hard to believe there were only four dancers. But, of course,
Beethoven's musical complexities involve only two hands (in Durham,
the capable hands of Paige Hoffman).
</P>
<P>
   If it was at least conceivable that Ms. Tharp would turn to
Beethoven, since she often employs classical music, who could have
imagined Ms. Brown as the choreographer and stage director for an
opera? Or that the opera would be ``L'Orfeo,'' a Monteverdi work
that ranks among the masterpieces of the 17th century? To be sure,
Ms. Brown created incidental dances for a staging of ``Carmen''
back in 1986. But this production, seen at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music in June, was her own conception, and surely even some of her
admirers could not have predicted it.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Ms. Brown participated in the experiments of the
Judson Dance Theater, which emphasized ordinary movements. Later,
she made dancers climb walls with the aid of harnesses. More
recently, she has favored deliberately elusive choreography in
which complicated phrases are introduced, only to be swept away
almost instantly. Ms. Brown's artistic progress has been
fascinating. Somehow, it led her to Monteverdi.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the designs of Roland Aeschlimann and the performances
by Concerto Vocale and Collegium Vocale, conducted by Rene Jacobs,
``L'Orfeo'' was scenically and musically notable, as well as
choreographically distinctive. Ms. Brown did much to stress
Monteverdi's contrasts between earth and air, light and darkness,
mortals and deities.
</P>
<P>
   The opera opened magically when, through a circular panel
resembling a porthole, the audience beheld a spirit floating,
seemingly weightless, through space. This figure kept returning
like an emissary from the heavens. The movements for the earthly
characters, many in loosely fitting white suits, were often based
on walking steps. Ms. Brown blended singers and dancers so
skillfully that it was sometimes hard to distinguish who was
dancing and who was singing. Yet, at emotionally charged moments,
the dancers' movements grew more complex, the dancing thereby
heightening the singers' dramatic gestures.
</P>
<P>
   When Euridice died and Orpheus journeyed to the underworld in
search of her, the backdrop darkened with what looked like an
eclipse, huge walls moved forward and Pluto's kingdom became a
realm of darkness. Stage lights were kept so low that shapes were
barely visible. And where some choreographers who stage operas
might have been tempted to keep the cast compulsively busy, Ms.
Brown was not afraid to have people stand still when immobility was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit came flying back to push away black curtains (and,
presumably, the forces of darkness), and Ms. Brown's staging
combined the two endings Monteverdi composed for the opera.
Exemplifying the way in which Renaissance artists could
Christianize Greek mythology, she had Apollo appear as a
Christ-like figure on the backdrop and promise immortality, even as
Orpheus met a martyr's death at the hands of the Bacchantes.
</P>
<P>
   Monteverdi's music often seems to glow. So, finally, did this
production. Ms. Brown and Ms. Tharp both demonstrate that when
experienced choreographers have vision and daring, miracles can
result.

 &HT;    Marianne Gingrich claims husband Newt took 'valuable assets'
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING TO (a) General news and (p) National political
categories.)
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt
Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's
assets until their divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition,
Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial
portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further
transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has
already transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation
and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all this came down, she had all the assets,'' Evans said.
``He was so detached from anything that had to do with finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich didn't even have a checkbook, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's counterclaim, filed Aug. 9 in Cobb Superior
Court, is not specific about what assets the former speaker is
accused of attempting to transfer. Her attorney, John Mayoue,
declined to elaborate on the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already
contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the
former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after
1998 GOP election losses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Mayoue has said that Marianne Gingrich is
prepared to thoroughly investigate her husband's personal life and
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce last month, after 18 years of
marriage. Marianne Gingrich immediately served notice that she
wanted to depose 33-year-old Callista Bisek of Arlington, Va., with
whom Gingrich is alleged to have an affair lasting several years.
Bisek works as an aide for the House Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue has convinced Judge Robinson to allow him to take a
video-taped deposition of Bisek. Mayoue has said he intends to
question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt
Gingrich. A date for the deposition has been tentatively set for
Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Tuesday that Newt Gingrich and Bisek ``had a
relationship,'' but declined to define it any further.

CENTRAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATES TO AVERT INFLATION

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve raised interest rates Tuesday
by a quarter of a percentage point, the second increase in less
than two months, saying the action should help avert inflation
while allowing the nation's long economic expansion to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside arguments from farmers, labor unions,
manufacturers and some politicians that there is no inflation to
fight, the central bank said it would increase the main rate it
controls, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among
banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. It also said it would raise
its more symbolic discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal
Reserve system to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said the risks of inflation should now be ``markedly''
diminished, a statement that investors and analysts read to suggest
that further rate increases this year, while by no means out of the
question, were unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively small, Tuesday's increases were intended to
slow the economy by raising borrowing costs, or at least to help
lock in a general rise over much of this year in the rates set by
the financial markets, from mortgages to corporate bond offerings.
Banks quickly raised their prime lending rates to 8.25 percent from
8 percent, a step that will result in higher rates on some consumer
and small business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks see-sawed after the Fed's announcement and ended the day
mixed. But analysts said the hint that further rate increases might
not be necessary was good news for investors, who have bid stock
prices up to record levels recently on the assumption that the
central bank could control inflation without a protracted series of
rate increases. Apparently driven by that reasoning, bond prices
rose Tuesday, pushing long-term rates down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Fed portrayed its decision as another step
in reversing the three quarter-point rate cuts it made last fall,
when the global financial system was threatening to seize up and
other countries were looking to the United States for help in
keeping their economies afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The global crisis has largely passed, and in the meantime the
American economy has continued to expand robustly, setting off some
tentative warning signals about inflation but generating almost no
actual inflation so far.
</P>
<P>
   Having now taken back two of last fall's three rate cuts, the
Fed distinctly left open the possibility that it could raise rates
a third time this year. Economists said the central bank could
still increase rates another notch at its next meeting on Oct. 5 or
the subsequent meeting on Nov. 16, if economic data showed
inflationary pressure in the form of a sharp decline in
unemployment, further big wage increases or a substantial rise in
the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
   But its statement suggested that the Fed saw its work as more
likely to be finished for the year, with any threat of inflation
now well contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to view the odds of an Oct. 5 rate hike as
considerably less than 50-50 at this point,'' said Bill Dudley, an
economist at Goldman, Sachs in New York. ``Obviously it depends on
the data, but most likely the Fed is done for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's statement said that with financial markets having
recovered, economies worldwide bouncing back and strong growth in
the United States creating an extremely tight labor market, ``the
degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial
market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained,
non-inflationary economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In what analysts said was an important shift in tone by the
central bank, the statement added that the combination of the two
rate increases by the Fed plus a rise in recent months in the
longer-term rates set by the markets ``should markedly diminish the
risk of rising inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank said it had adopted a neutral outlook about the
need for any changes to monetary policy over the short run, meaning
that it does not see any clear evidence now that it will have to
raise rates again. But it is unclear how much value that stance has
in predicting the Fed's decision when it meets in October, because
it adopted a neutral position after raising rates a quarter-point
on June 30 and went on to raise rates again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's action drew criticism from a variety of
interest groups and politicians who traditionally oppose higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
   They said Tuesday that the increase was unjustified at a time
when overall inflation is nearly dormant and the prices of farm
products and some other commodities are falling or depressed. They
said most companies had little ability to raise prices because of
intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when inflation is almost dormant and when foreign
markets are only now beginning to emerge from recession, this
decision is a disappointment,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the rate increase would
``increase the likelihood that our national economic progress will
continue to fail to benefit fully those at the lower end of the
economic spectrum.'' Steve Forbes, the Republican presidential
candidate, said the Fed was turning a mighty economy into ``the
economic equivalent of the Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   But economists on Wall Street said the Fed was doing the right
thing to fight inflation before it takes root because price
stability has been the foundation on which the long expansion has
been built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right with the Fed on this issue,'' said Allen Sinai, an
economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York, adding that
the central bank had to act early because ``inflation is a glacial
process, loaded with inertia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As it has for the last several years, the Fed's Federal Open
Market Committee came into Tuesday's meeting facing a raft of
somewhat contradictory economic data.
</P>
<P>
   Although it slowed in the second quarter and faces potential
trouble from a rapidly expanding trade deficit and a weakening
dollar, the economy appears to have regained momentum over the
summer. Industrial output last month rose to its highest rate in
more than a year. Housing starts remain strong and retail sales are
robust. Demand for imports was strong, and rebounding economies in
Asia and Europe mean better prospects for exporters.
</P>
<P>
   With growth strong, job creation has remained brisk, and wages
rose last month at a pace that while gratifying to workers was seen
by some economists as the first signs of a possible inflationary
spiral. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly focused in
his public comments on the depletion of the labor pool and the
possibility of an excessive surge in wages as the most immediate
inflationary threat to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, inflation by nearly all measures has remained controlled,
if not dormant, leaving the Fed in the position of fighting what
the central bank's critics consider a phantom menace.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has had to weigh several other tricky issues in setting
policy. It would clearly prefer not to have to raise rates later
this year at a time when the Year 2000 computer problem could be
having real or psychological effects on the economy and the
financial markets. Some analysts said the Fed might have decided to
tighten policy Tuesday to reduce the need to do so late in the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also continues to grapple with the relentless
rise in stock prices, seeing both a threat to financial stability
in the possibility of a market crash and a ``wealth effect'' that
fuels consumption at a time when the Fed is trying to slow the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates generally dampen enthusiasm among
investors, but Wall Street has shrugged off two successive rate
increases, at least partially offsetting any slowdown that the
higher rates might bring.

JUDGE BLOCKS CLEVELAND'S SCHOOL VOUCHER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Fla., Maine, Wis.)  (js) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CHICAGO _ One day before the start of the school year in
Cleveland, a federal judge issued an injunction Tuesday blocking
the city's four-year-old voucher program, preventing several
thousand children from attending private and parochial schools at
taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. of U.S. District Court
in Cleveland said that there was probable cause to believe that the
school voucher program violated the constitutional separation of
church and state. Noting that the vast majority of the private
schools in the program were religious schools, the judge declared
that ``the Cleveland program has the primary effect of advancing
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said he was blocking the voucher program until he had
time to consider a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, but
he said in his opinion that there was ``no substantial
possibility'' that he would ultimately rule in favor of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is expected to be closely watched around the
country as cities face calls from advocates of school choice to use
public money to send children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may also affect the nation's first statewide
voucher program, begun this year in Florida, which is being
challenged in state court by some of the same plaintiffs who sued
to block Cleveland's program.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's decision is only the second time a federal court has
ruled on the issue of vouchers, legal experts said. The first was a
ruling earlier this year that denied a request by three families in
Maine to use public money for tuition at a Roman Catholic School.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland decision is considered especially significant
because it halts a program that had been under way for years and
was the nation's first program to allow vouchers to be used for
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   One other city, Milwaukee, began its voucher program in 1990 but
did not allow religious schools to participate until after
Cleveland did. The Milwaukee program was upheld by the Wisconsin
Supreme Court last year, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear
appeals of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a tremendous victory,'' said Joseph L. Conn, a
spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
part of a coalition of civil liberties and public education
organizations that sued to block the Cleveland program.
``Basically, this brings the voucher train to a screeching halt,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Bolick, the litigation director for the Institute for
Justice, which argued for the voucher program, called the decision
``an outrageous abuse of judicial power.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his organization had already filed an appeal and hoped
to have the injunction lifted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you would see an injunction like this come with a
program that had not yet started,'' Bolick said. ``Literally, on
the eve of the fourth year of this program, the court has seen fit
to turn the world upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 4,000 children expecting to start classes at 56
private and parochial schools, Oliver said he recognized that his
ruling would be disruptive. But he added that allowing the voucher
program to continue until he had made his final decision could
``cause an even greater harm to the children by setting them up for
greater disruption at a later time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland program, created by the Ohio Legislature in 1995,
pays up to $2,500 in tuition costs for children in low-income
families. For the 1999-2000 school year, about 5 percent of the
77,000 children in Cleveland's public schools were signed up for
the voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   William Wendling, a spokesman for the Cleveland Municipal School
District, said that all the children would be welcome but that
``clearly, it is going to be a scramble to find teachers and
facilities and transportation for all of these students.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wendling said the voucher students would not start school on
Wednesday with the rest of the district's schoolchildren because it
would take a few days to make arrangements and decide how many of
the 4,000 students could remain in their private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Sula, who sends three of her children, ages 6, 8 and
10, to Our Lady of Good Counsel School under the voucher program,
found out about the ruling as she was painting hopscotch squares on
the school's playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's discrimination against people of faith and I
think the state has the ability to fund public schools and help
with private schools at the same time,'' said Mrs. Sula, who added
that her husband, a guard at the county jail, planned to work
double shifts to continue sending her children to the Catholic
school. ``It's going to hurt a lot financially, but we're just
going to have to bite the bullet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolick said his organization would try to drum up private
donations to pay tuition costs for those who participated in the
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland program was challenged in court almost immediately
after it had begun four years ago, and the legal battle worked its
way to the Ohio Supreme Court. That court ruled in May that the
program was unconstitutional because it was created as an amendment
to the state budget rather than in a separate piece of legislation.
But the court also said the program did not violate the separation
of church and state, leaving the door open for state legislators to
revive it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Legislature did so, with a separate education
bill, prompting opponents of the voucher program to file the
lawsuit on which Oliver ruled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Cleveland program has been buffeted by
financial and academic problems. Most recently, state education
officials recommended removing three schools from the program after
a newspaper detailed potentially unsafe conditions and a
predominantly unlicensed staff at one of the private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher opponents had seized on such flaws to claim the program
did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cleveland voucher program was bad law, bad policy, bad
education for the kids,'' Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers, said Tuesday. ``Now we can make sure the
money will be in the public schools, where there is a real school
improvement effort going on.''

HURRICANE BRET LEAVES TEXANS FEELING LUCKY   
(DW)

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The remnants of Hurricane Bret moved into northern
Mexico on Tuesday after officials in the Texas border town of
Laredo blamed heavy rainfall from the storm for a traffic accident
in which four people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Laredo had feared that the storm would stall over
the low-lying city and repeat the heavy flooding that Tropical
Storm Charlie brought last year to another Texas border town, Del
Rio. Instead, the storm kept moving, causing sporadic flooding in
Laredo but no serious damage there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged a major bullet,'' said Jerry Garza, a spokesman for
the city of Laredo. Garza said city officials had declared a state
of emergency after the National Weather Service predicted up to 20
inches of rain, which might have caused the creeks throughout the
city to overflow. ``The creeks filled up,'' Garza said, ``but it
stopped raining.''
</P>
<P>
   Designated Category 4, or extremely dangerous, because of its
145 mile-per-hour winds, the storm veered away from heavily
populated Corpus Christi and came ashore on Sunday in Kenedy
County, a rural expanse of pasture land with only 460 people. Once
ashore, the storm quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical
storm by Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety,
said officials had estimated that casualties could have been as
high as 1,500 people if the storm had delivered a direct blow to
Corpus Christi. Instead, it meandered westward from Kenedy County
through areas with few, if any, people. The National Weather
Service estimated that the storm had dropped from 25 to 35 inches
of rain in Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very lucky,'' said Brian LaMarre, a weather service
meteorologist. ``If it had landed in Corpus Christi or Houston or
any populated area, it would have caused phenomenal damage. As it
was, it turned out to be a rainmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of evacuees continued to return home on Tuesday
from inland shelters and hotels, utility workers all but restored
electricity in affected areas. The Texas Public Utility Commission
reported that 3,000 people remained without power but predicted
that all power would be restored by Wednesday. Nearly 3,000 people
remained without telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal traffic accident in Laredo occurred on Monday
afternoon as heavy rains from the storm deluged the city. Officials
said that a tractor-trailer truck jackknifed on a rainy, windy
highway and smashed into a pickup truck. Three people in the pickup
were killed, as was the driver of the tractor-trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That accident happened right when the really heavy part of
Tropical Storm Bret starting affecting Laredo,'' Garza said.

MARKET PLACE: ANALYST SHIFTS, AND TIME WARNER SHARES FALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Brazil and Japan)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Time Warner Inc. tumbled about 7 percent
Tuesday after a Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. analyst who has been a strong
supporter of the stock sharply reduced her earnings estimates for
the company, citing problems in its music business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Time Warner fell $4.5625, to $61.625, after falling as
low as $60. More than 15.6 million shares changed hands, making the
company's stock the seventh most traded issue.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, Jessica Reif Cohen, lowered her earnings estimate
for 1999 to 35 cents a share from 48 cents and her estimate for
2000 to 80 cents from 82 cents. She cited Time Warner's declining
share in the American music market and weakness in key foreign
markets like Germany, Brazil and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The revision spooked Wall Street because Time Warner stock over
the last three years has been a stellar performer, although it has
been falling in the last month or so. ``Any kind of a
disappointment in a momentum stock like that gets people nervous,''
said David Londoner, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors saw the fall in the stock price as an
over-reaction by the market and a buying opportunity. After all,
some noted, Ms. Cohen's estimate had been much higher than those of
most other analysts, and her revision merely moves her close to the
average estimate of 37 cents a share for this year and 67 cents for
next year, as compiled by First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings. Moreover, some said, the problems in the record business
have generally been known. Also, even Ms. Cohen herself still rates
Time Warner a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually bought some more stock this morning,'' said Mark
Greenberg, portfolio manager of the Invesco Leisure Fund, which
counts Time Warner as one of its 10 largest holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg noted that Time Warner named a new head of its music
division last week and said it was not unusual for new executives
to try to lower expectations at the start so they have some room to
show improvement. ``I don't believe there's a fundamental problem
at Time Warner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman of Warner Music, Roger Ames, is taking over
from Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, who were known primarily for
running the Warner Brothers movie studio and had little experience
in music. Ames, a former head of music operations at Polygram NV,
will be faced with ending years of management turmoil at Warner
Music, stemming a slide in market share and strengthening the
company's international operations, which have never been as strong
as its American business.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Tuesday, Ms. Cohen said that despite healthy
conditions for the music industry as a whole, ``Warner Music has
been experiencing a downturn in its domestic and international
music sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's share of the overall album business in the United
States declined to 16.6 percent in the first half of this year from
18.3 percent in the period a year earlier, she said, while
Seagram's Universal Music gained strength after its acquisition of
Polygram.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, which ended in June, Time Warner reported
a decline in revenue in its record business but an improvement in
earnings, in part because of cost savings. But Ms. Cohen said cost
cuts would make less of a difference going forward. She cut her
estimate of music division earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization to $478 million for this year from a previous estimate
of $540 million. Last year, the company had music earnings of $493
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen also increased her estimates of the losses to be
recorded by the WB Network, citing its additional spending on
distribution in smaller markets.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has in recent years replaced the struggling Walt
Disney Co. as the queen of media stocks. Time Warner stock, which
trades under the symbol TWX, has gone from a 52-week low of less
than $38 to a recent high of more than $78. But it has been falling
in the last few weeks as the market began to view the stock as
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen recommends the stock, with a 12-month price target of
$85. ``While we continue to recommend TWX as a core media holding,
we believe the shares may continue to tread water near term as
current year estimates decrease,'' she said.

GETTING DOWN TO WHAT MAKES AMERICA HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 29)

 By ANDY MEISLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ Several years ago, the Oscar-winning
director Robert Zemeckis was making a movie on location when he
discovered that one of his principal cast members had a serious
drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   The actor failed to show up for a night scene he was to appear
in. After a costly delay, it was discovered that a local bartender,
having watched the actor drink himself into insensibility, had
driven him back to his motel.
</P>
<P>
   As Zemeckis remembered it during an interview in his office on
the Universal Studios backlot, his immediate reaction was swift and
terrible: at 2 a.m. he phoned the local doctor who was on call for
the film company, summoned him to the set and proceeded to berate
him, loudly blaming him and him alone for the actor's inebriated
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrational? Of course,'' Zemeckis said. ``I would hope that I
wouldn't react the same way again. But it was simply the
unbelievable frustration of not being in control of this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head ruefully. His story, he admitted, is a
``perfect parable'' for society's chronically wrongheaded approach
to the complicated problem of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that quickly becomes apparent,'' he said, ``is that
there is no solution to the problem. You can't control what is
basically a personal journey. You can't legislate sobriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that American legislators haven't tried. In fact, Zemeckis _
a 48-year-old Hollywood filmmaker not formerly even vaguely
associated with the low-profile world of nonfiction television _
has made a two-hour documentary on this very subject.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The Pursuit of Happiness: Smoking, Drinking and
Drugging in the 20th Century,'' the film is to have its premiere on
the Showtime cable network on Sept. 13 as part of ``In the 20th
Century,'' a millennium-related series using well-known directors
to take on major subjects of their choosing. It is a rare
full-length examination of a topic that lends itself easily to
rousing slogans and pithy sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is with the help of dozens of these fleeting but
oh-so-emphatic references to drugs, alcohol, tobacco and addiction
that Zemeckis makes his main points. He culled them from sources as
varied as presidential press conferences, the utterances of
presidential ``drug czars,'' newsreels, beer commercials, old
magazine ads, old sitcoms like ``Leave It to Beaver,'' standup
comedy routines, exploitation films like ``Reefer Madness'' and
Hollywood blockbusters (including his own).
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with hundreds of hours of wonderful material,''
said Zemeckis. One can see, for example, Desi Arnaz hawking Camels,
Newt Gingrich advocating the death penalty for drug dealing, Jack
Webb pontificating on the horrors of LSD, a gaggle of tobacco
executives swearing that cigarettes aren't addictive and a
psychedelically dressed Sonny Bono urging his fans ``not to become
potheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with these half-forgotten audiovisual artifacts are
on-camera interviews with numerous historians, former addicts,
addiction counselors and other experts, including a spokesman for
Alcoholics Anonymous, an advocate of medical marijuana use, a
libertarian proponent of drug decriminalization, the author of
``Denial Is Not a River in Egypt'' and the radio personality Dr.
Demento, a connoisseur of drug-soaked pop music from Cab Calloway
to Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing what we discovered,'' said Zemeckis. ``For
instance: when I started this project. I thought that the so-called
drug crisis was something that was happening right now; our
generation's problem, as bad as it's ever been. But it turns out
that the crisis has been going on forever _ and actually, the worst
period in our country's history was the 1830s, when the entire
country was on a bender and everybody was walking around drunk.
Actually, the country has been sobering up pretty interestingly
since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other arguments made in ``The Pursuit of Happiness'':
that American society has habitually criminalized the substances
used primarily by minorities (i.e., opium for Asian immigrants and
marijuana and cocaine for African-Americans) while legalizing those
used by white adults (i.e., beer, alcohol and tobacco). That the
advent of Prohibition in the 1920s, far from springing full-blown
from a groundswell of public indignation, was in large part an
economic imperative pushed by industrialists like Henry Ford who
wanted reliable, sober workers for their new assembly lines. That
antidrug public service announcements and school programs, though
well-meaning and organized with creativity and passion, have had
little proven effect on drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Also: that the search for pleasure, chemical-based or otherwise,
is a not ``problem'' that can be addressed as if it somehow stands
apart from our very identities as Americans and human beings. One
of the most striking moments in the documentary is at the beginning
when an actor recites the ``pursuit of happiness'' clause in the
Declaration of Independence against a background of images ranging
from public inebriation to a smiling little girl twirling herself
dizzy on a tree swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' intones one of the experts, ``the impulse to alter
what we ordinarily call ordinary waking consciousness is inborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most provocative aspect of ``Smoking, Drinking and
Drugging'' is that its approach is accepted by the very experts and
authority figures usually arrayed on the other side of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that it wasn't intended to be an antidrug piece,
but a comprehensive and sophisticated treatment of a very complex
issue, I thought it was great,'' said Ginna Marston, one of
Zemeckis' interviewees and a spokeswoman for Parternship for a
Drug-Free America, the advertising-industry coalition that produces
the well-known antidrug public service announcements (``This is
your brain on drugs'').
</P>
<P>
   ``When we signed on to Bob doing this,'' Mark Zakarin,
Showtime's executive vice president for original programming, said
carefully, ``we realized that he was going to bring a point of view
to it. All we asked was there be an intelligent framework to his
subjectivity, and inside that framework enough objective reality
that we can all agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his current project, the sum of Zemeckis' experience with
the documentary form was in the early 1970s, during a short stint
as an assistant news editor at a Chicago television station.
Zakarin maintains that inexperience was never a problem. Zemeckis
didn't see it as an obstacle, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm addicted to documentaries,'' he said. ``That's all I watch
on television. It started with ``The American Experience,'' on PBS,
and now I watch the History Channel, the Learning Channel _
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis was born and reared in the Chicago area. He says he was
a heavy drinker in college _ a habit, he adds, that disappeared
once he transferred to film school at the University of Southern
California. After making several unsuccessful feature films in the
1970s and early 1980s, he had a run of hits, beginning with
``Romancing the Stone'' in 1984. Soon after came ``Back to the
Future'' (1985), ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' (1988) and ``Forrest
Gump'' (1994). For the latter, he won the Academy Award for best
director.

DOCTORS ABLE TO HALT ANTI-REJECTION DRUGS IN KIDNEY RECIPIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors in Boston reported Tuesday that a bone-marrow transplant
had enabled a kidney-transplant patient to survive without
anti-rejection drugs and that nearly a year later, she was showing
no sign of rejection. They said they believed it was the first time
that doctors had performed an organ transplant with the intention
of stopping anti-rejection therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the operation were unusual: The patient had
a form of cancer, multiple myeloma, that led to kidney failure as a
complication, and doctors said they felt the only possible
treatment was a double transplant. But they also hoped the
transplants would induce a state of immune tolerance in the
patient, a condition known as mixed chimerism.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper in the Aug. 27 issue of the journal Transplantation,
and in a news release Tuesday, doctors at Massachusetts General
Hospital announced they had succeeded. The patient, a woman in her
50s from the Boston area, underwent surgery last September. Her
kidney is functioning normally, and she has not taken
anti-rejection drugs since the 73rd day after the transplants,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, nearly all transplant recipients must, for the rest of
their lives, take powerful anti-rejection drugs, whose side effects
include increased risks of infection, diabetes, cancer and other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedure has limited use, said Dr. Thomas Spitzer, a
transplant researcher at Massachusetts General and a participant in
the procedure. In this case, the donor was the patient's sister,
increasing the chance of success because of their biological
closeness. The doctors also said they used a new, less toxic type
of bone-marrow transplant, which allows the recipient to preserve
most of her own marrow. This led, the doctors said, to the blended
immune system that characterizes mixed chimerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further research will refine the way we can create mixed
chimerism for organ tolerance,'' Spitzer said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the research team, Dr. Benedict Cosimi, was
cautiously optimistic about broader applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first step toward the day when transplant recipients
can be made tolerant to their donors' organs without the risks and
costs of lifelong immunosuppressive drugs,'' Cosimi said. ``We hope
to be able to use this approach with less closely matched donors,
providing even more options for patients needing transplanted
organs.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his team had considered a couple of other
candidates for a similar double transplant, but that they were
``too sick or not appropriately matched.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``It is something we are ready to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if they were ready to perform transplants between an
unrelated donor and patient, Spitzer said, ``We're getting close to
the point where we would feel comfortable enough, but not quite.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in chimerism as a factor in the success of transplants
has grown in recent years, partly as a result of anecdotes about
patients who chose to stop taking anti-rejection drugs many months
after receiving a new organ. A leader in adapting chimerism in
transplantation has been Dr. Thomas Starzl, a professor of surgery
at the University of Pittsburgh, who pioneered liver transplants in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Work along these lines has been conducted by a number of
research teams, including those at Massachusetts General.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a very significant achievement that they were
able to treat renal failure plus an underlying bone marrow
disease,'' Starzl, who did not participate in the Boston
transplants, told The Associated Press. ``This is really an
exploitation at a very practical level of fundamental principles of
transplantation.''

BELGIAN SAYS SERBS USED GAS ON KOSOVARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A Belgian scientist is reported to have found
evidence that Yugoslavia used chemical weapons on ethnic Albanian
fighters and civilians in Kosovo during the months of the NATO
bombing and before peacekeepers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   His findings were immediately challenged by U.S. and U.N.
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Janes Defence Weekly says in its latest issue, to be published
Wednesday in London, that the findings showed that Kosovar
Albanians were attacked with BZ gas or a similar compound, which
does not kill but causes disorientation and confusion. Its use is
prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian scientist, Aubin Heyndrickx, director of the
International Reference University Laboratories in Ghent, went to
the Balkans in May to take samples from Kosovar Albanians in two
hospitals, one in Kosovo and one in Albania. The rebels had bases
in northern Albania, and Serbs fired over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Heyndrickx was invited by the Kosovo Liberation Army, Janes
said.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the samples led Heyndrickx to conclude that a
cocktail of agents may have been used in shells fired in Kosovo,
where, he said, people reported that ``hundreds'' had been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts reacted with skepticism. Heyndrickx, who has done
similar studies in Iran and Angola, did not respond to calls
Tuesday to his home and office seeking more information.
</P>
<P>
   John Parachini, a chemical weapons expert at the Washington
office of the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said
charges of chemical attacks have been made frequently by all sides
in the decade of civil war in the Balkans. All have been hard to
prove, though experts agree Yugoslavia has such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Monterey Institute in California, Jason Pate, a research
associate in the chemical and biological nonproliferation project,
said BZ can be very hard to detect because there are no lingering
effects, contrary to Heyndrickx's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not really long-term effects from BZ intoxication,
so the soldiers would be able to return to work rather quickly,''
he added. ``But in the short term, it is certainly an effective
tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would not be surprised to learn that BZ had been
used in Kosovo but that proving it would be difficult.

NORTHRIDGE'S BRADY MOLDED IN FLOWERS' IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to mistake the coach and quarterback for teammates,
because they were.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Aaron Flowers was playing his final season at Cal State
Northridge and Marcus Brady was a 17-year-old freshman. Now, less
than two years after his final game as a Matador, Flowers is
teaching Brady everything he knows about the run-and-shoot offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the best quarterback situation in the
country,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin said. ``What Marcus
Brady has been able to absorb from Aaron is the nuances of the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The molding of Brady into Flowers' image has been so successful
that Flowers' father, Norm, can instantly see the similarities when
he watches film of his son's senior year and Brady from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brady)'s drop and release looks so much like Aaron,'' said
Norm Flowers, a former high school coach. ``I don't know if that's
a natural thing, or what.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see Aaron Flowers in Brady. Both are about the
same height and build, although Flowers said there is one
noticeable difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When stuff breaks down and he starts to scramble, he doesn't
look like me,'' he said, noting Brady's superior athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, who had the best passing season in CSUN history in 1996
when he threw for 3,540 yards and 30 touchdowns, is in the unusual
situation of watching his records be smashed _ from the sideline.
He thinks Brady has a good chance to break those records this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the day comes sooner than everyone thinks,'' Flowers
said. ``I'm going to be happy for him on that day. I'm one of the
guys that got this thing started and he's going to be known as one
of the guys who got it to the next level, that won a Big Sky
championship, that won a national championship.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Easy transition
</P>
<P>
   For Flowers, becoming a coach was a natural progression. His dad
was a coach and Aaron played like a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Flowers was the head coach at Artesia from 1990-95. He said
other parents' objections to Aaron becoming the starting
quarterback ended quickly when they saw the kid's uncanny
combination of intensity and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things he had as a player, they are intangibles you just
can't coach,'' Norm said. ``Someone once said (Aaron) was obsessed
with football.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady has talked about Flowers' ability to ``control the
offense.'' It wasn't hard for Flowers, considering he was calling
his own plays as a sophomore _ in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knows the offense,'' Brady said of his first-year
coach. ``It makes it that much easier. What I see is what he saw.''
</P>
<P>
   And what most see is a young coach who has a firm grasp of the
run-and-shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers was a graduate assistant last year when Brady threw for
2,983 yards and 26 touchdowns. After the season ended, and to the
delight of Brady, then head coach Ron Ponciano promoted Flowers to
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Flowers could easily be playing and not coaching
football, but that doesn't matter. Because he is only 6-foot,
Flowers _ the Big Sky Newcomer of the Year in '96 and second-team
all-conference two consecutive years _ never thought about playing
in the NFL, or even the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to leave my family to go up to Canada... just
to take a shot,'' he said. ``I felt I had done what I wanted to do
in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers transferred his competitive energy to coaching. When the
lease on the house he shared ended this summer, Flowers slept in
the Matadors' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neatest thing I notice about Aaron is how much he cares
about the players,'' said Amber Saenz, Flowers' girlfriend of
almost two years. ``He never reflects on what he has (done). He
would rather bring it out of someone else. He could care less if
his name is ever brought up in a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brags about the records Marcus is going to break,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's All-American
</P>
<P>
   Brady spent the summer doing clerical work for the County of San
Diego. Every once in a while, he would get a call from Flowers.
``Just to make sure nothing was distracting me,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy for Brady to relax or let down after the impact
he made as a freshman. But that hasn't happened, given his
performance during the team's first weeks of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is playing at a high, high level,'' Kearin said after a
recent practice.
</P>
<P>
   That should be no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who played three sports in high school, started at
quarterback and was the team captain at San Diego's Morse High in
1996, and the Eagles went 12-1. As a junior, he started at
off-guard for the basketball team. He pitched, played shortstop and
outfield for a baseball team that once beat the No. 1 team in the
nation _ Mt. Carmel, which featured future first-round draft
choices Eric Chavez and Eric Munson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports has been pretty much my whole life,'' Brady said.
``(Sports) fits my personality. I love to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was growing up, Brady spent hours playing basketball in
his driveway. He played to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd lose, he wanted to get another teammate,'' said Drew
Amerson, a redshirt freshman wide receiver at CSUN who grew up near
Brady in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Brady graduated from high school with a 3.6 GPA and scored 1,150
on the SAT. If he was two or three inches taller, Brady could have
played for any team in the nation. But at 5-11, his options were
limited to the Ivy League, which doesn't offer athletic
scholarships, or the service academies.
</P>
<P>
   Brady chose the Navy. After only a few months of what he called
``boot camp,'' he quit and came home.
</P>
<P>
   Brady ended up at CSUN simply because the coaching staff didn't
block his desire to play quarterback. Every college that recruited
him out of high school wanted Brady to play defensive back or wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Brady spent the season on the sideline as a redshirt,
watching Flowers. He had never heard of Flowers before, but he
admired Flowers' toughness as he played through a stress fracture
in his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Brady hurt his elbow against Northern Arizona last year but came
back to play against Eastern Washington the next week. He completed
19 of 24 passes for 285 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way I was going to sit out that next game,''
Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, Brady displayed the toughness and leadership
that marked Flowers' two years at CSUN. Now he has Flowers teaching
him the system.
</P>
<P>
   Is this destiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I have one of the greatest jobs for a young coach
because I have a kid like (Brady),'' he said. ``I see it as a big
risk. He was the Big Sky Newcomer of the Year (last year). What if
his numbers drop and he throws 20 interceptions? Where is the blame
going to go? To me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay up at night thinking about if he gets hurt or if I am
doing too much stuff with him, putting too much in his brain,'' he
said. ``Time will tell.''

 &HT;    Virginia hurting on defense
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ Virginia has won at least seven games 12
years in a row, but that success could be in jeopardy as coach
George Welsh prepares for his 18th season with the Cavaliers. Four
defensive players have been suspended for the season for either
academic or legal problems. A fifth, backup tailback Antwoine
Womack, who rushed for 708 yards and made second-team All-ACC in
1998, has taken a leave of absence for this season because of legal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among the defenders, only end Darryl Sanders (academics) was
projected as a starter, but safety Devon Simmons (legal trouble)
and linebackers Donny Green (academics) and John Duckett (legal)
would have had significant playing time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers expect problems on defense, the unit that has been
strong in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't have the talent we've had in the past,'' Welsh
said. ``The talent and the depth on defense is not what it's been.
I'd rather win games with defense. I've won games with defense and
a good running game in the past, but that's not enough today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs appear strong on offense. Most of the starters are
back. One who isn't is quarterback Aaron Brooks, who graduated. His
replacement is Dan Ellis, who says he doesn't run as well as Brooks
and can't throw as far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a pocket-type quarterback,'' he said. ``I guess
I'm the one big question mark coming into the season, although I
don't see myself as a question mark.'' Ellis will be Virginia's
seventh quarterback in eight seasons, but that isn't necessarily a
detriment, starting tailback Thomas Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's going to do a good job,'' Jones said. ``He's really
smart and makes good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones rushed for 1,303 yards last season to lead the ACC. He
scored 15 times and is the No. 4 returning rusher in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 205-pounder and native of Big Stone Gap, Va.,
attended three summer schools, took an overload of course hours
each year and graduated in three years with a degree in psychology.
He is in graduate school this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said contact is what he likes best about football.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may sound kind of weird, being a running back, but it
makes me feel good to play hard for 60 minutes,'' he said. ``With
Antwoine out, I may have to carry four or five times more per game,
but I feel I get better as the game goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the biggest disappointment of his career has been
last season's 41-38 loss to Georgia Tech. Virginia led 38-17 before
the Yellow Jackets scored 24 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had won that game,'' Jones said, ``we could have easily
jumped into the top five (in the rankings).''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems worried about a drop in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be second in the ACC,'' linebacker Shannon
Taylor said. ``We want to be involved in the BCS (Bowl Championship
Series). We had a chance last year and lost to Georgia Tech. Coach
said this is the fastest team he's ever had. I believe strongly
we're a top 10 team.''

MICROSOFT HIRES FORMER SILICON GRAPHICS CHAIRMAN TO HEAD INTERNET
UNIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Italy)  By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft has selected Richard Belluzzo, a computer industry
veteran, to head its Internet operations, signaling that its future
lies more in electronic commerce than in becoming a media company.
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo, 45, resigned on Monday as the chairman and chief
executive officer of Silicon Graphics Inc., a position he held less
than two years. He joined the struggling maker of computer work
stations in January 1998, after a 22-year career at Hewlett-Packard
Co., where he rose to become the No. 2 executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Belluzzo was
expected to go to Microsoft to head its Internet operations.
Microsoft declined to comment, and Belluzzo could not be reached.
But industry executives close to Belluzzo said he does plan to head
Microsoft's Internet unit, which is now called the Consumer and
Commerce Group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s strategy for the World Wide Web has been
evolving toward commerce for some time. The company, once regarded
as a potential media powerhouse, has focused its recent Web
investments mainly on communications, shopping, travel, scheduling
and personal finance. Its plan is essentially to transfer its
strength in the personal computer business to the Internet arena _
developing popular software that makes people more productive.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Microsoft has pulled back from some of its
media ventures. Last month, the company sold off its collection of
city arts and entertainment guides, MSN Sidewalk, for about $240
million to Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet era, the distinction between software and
services are increasingly blurring. Microsoft intends to funnel the
people who use its Internet software to commerce sites in travel,
banking and shopping _ sites in which Microsoft has a stake or that
generate transaction revenues for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy now is to use its software strengths to create a
transaction backbone for the Internet,'' said Mark R. Anderson,
president of Technology Alliance Partners, a research firm. ``And
Microsoft is really pulling back from the media stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives close to Belluzzo said the timing of the
Silicon Graphics announcement on Monday caught Microsoft somewhat
by surprise when senior executives, including Steven Ballmer, the
president, are on vacation. Belluzzo is expected to begin work at
Microsoft in September.
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo made his industry reputation as the executive largely
responsible for building Hewlett-Packard's computer printer
business into a consumer category. As a young executive, Belluzzo
pushed to lower manufacturing costs for printers to make them
affordable and marketed them aggressively through retailers.
</P>
<P>
   For Hewlett-Packard, the printer business now generates sales of
more than $17 billion a year. Before he left for Silicon Graphics,
Belluzzo also oversaw the strategy for the reinvigorating
Hewlett-Packard's personal computer business, which has thrived in
the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands consumers and he understands consumer
branding,'' said Jeffrey Christian of Christian Timbers Inc., an
executive recruiter who knows Belluzzo. ``And he's run large,
complex technology businesses before. Microsoft is going after a
solid technology executive, but he is not as obvious a choice as
someone coming straight out of one of the Internet companies like
Yahoo or Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has conducted a wide-ranging search since last
November when Pete Higgins, a group vice president, stepped down.
to take a permanent leave of absence. Microsoft has considered
several candidates including some from well-known Internet
companies. For example, George Bell, the president of Excite At
Home Corp., has said he was approached about the Microsoft job, but
declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer and Commerce Group is currently headed by a pair of
executives, Brad Chase and Jon DeVaan, who are highly regarded at
Microsoft. Chase is a veteran marketer who led the campaigns for
Windows 95 and Internet Explorer. He is now a key strategist in the
company's come-from-behind competition against America Online.
DeVaan is known as a technology executive, who led the effort to
inject Internet software into Microsoft's Office programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chase and DeVaan are expected to continue in their current
assignments. But it will fall to Belluzzo to run the business and
make sure that Microsoft is an increasing force in the Internet. At
Microsoft, according to industry executives close to the company,
Belluzzo is viewed as a solid leader who understands the industry
and who should learn the Internet business quickly.
</P>
<P>
   His sometimes difficult experience at Silicon Graphics, which is
still losing money and recently shifted strategy once again, is
regarded by Microsoft more as a useful learning experience than a
black mark on his career, according to executives close to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo's hardening experiences came early. The son of Italian
immigrants, Belluzzo began working at age 11, doing everything from
sweeping floors to picking prunes in the orchards near Santa Rosa,
Calif., where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Business Week magazine, Belluzzo recalled
that a big motivation for improving himself came from a high school
guidance counselor told him he was not college material. The
humbling encounter, Belluzzo said, prompted him to lose 50 pounds
and study hard. ``That motivated me to go to school, and do
something more than manual labor,'' he told Business Week. &QL;

EL GUERROUJ EXTENDS WINNING STREAK IN 1,500-METER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ As he floated toward the finish line and his
second straight 1,500-meter world championship, Hicham El Guerrouj
had time to throw kisses. First with one hand, then the other,
finally both. With the tender expression on his boyish face, there
was never a question of boastfulness: This was a young man thanking
someone.
</P>
<P>
   One was for his family, he explained later. Another for the
crowd. And the third? To pay tribute, the 24-year-old Moroccan
said, to having just run in ``one of the best races of this
century, and that makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   El Guerrouj's winning time of 3 minutes 27.65 seconds (the
fifth-fastest in history) was just 1.65 seconds off his world
record, and as he came through the final 100 meters, many in the
crowd of 50,810 rocking Estadio Olimpico thought they were about to
see it broken. El Guerrouj knew he would fall short, but said there
are more important things in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have the world record,'' he said with a smile.
``This is about winning the world title.''
</P>
<P>
   Just behind him, as expected, was Noah Ngeny, the 20-year-old
Kenyan who helped push El Guerrouj to his world record in the mile
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm not unhappy,'' said Ngeny, whose 3:28.73 is a
Kenyan national record. ``El Guerrouj is a wonderful runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ngeny was followed by Reyes Estevez of Spain (3:30.57).
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, the Olympic gold medalist and
three-time world champion, was running in fifth as they began last
lap, but soon began to lose ground and did not finish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conditions _ 92 degrees and 50 percent humidity at
the 9:10 p.m. start _ it was the fastest 1,500 meters in World
Championship history, with El Guerrouj's countryman, Adil Kaouch,
setting a strong pace of 1:52.15 though 800 meters. As the last lap
began, El Guerrouj was in the lead, followed by Estevez, Ngeny, and
former Olympic champion Fermin Cacho of Spain. With about 300
meters left, the medalists became clear, as El Guerrouj began to
pull away and Ngeny passed Estevez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like that,'' American Steve Holman
(3:34.32, ninth) said of El Guerrouj's race. ``To run 3:27 after
rounds in this heat was otherworldly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Estevez complained of pace-setting by Kaouch (``the
beauty of the final was taken away''), El Guerrouj denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We entered the race each one for himself,'' he said. ``There
was no preplanned tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaouch finished last.
</P>
<P>
   And El Guerrouj, once again, first.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has not lost at 1,500 meters since his bell-lap fall
in the 1996 Olympics said doubt never entered his mind Tuesday
night that his streak would live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure about winning the race before and throughout my run
tonight,'' he said. ``It is as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second marquee event of the night, world record-holder
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia became a four-time world champion
with his 27:57.27 victory at 10,000 meters, a distance at which he

U.S. SAYS IRAQIS WERE KILLED BY THEIR OWN ARTILLERY FIRE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Intensifying the war of words over civilian bombing
casualties in Iraq, the Pentagon said Tuesday that Iraq's own
antiaircraft artillery, not U.S. fighter jets, killed two people
during a clash in northern Iraq on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also said reconnaissance photographs showed that
Iraq had put launchers for surface-to-air missiles in residential
areas in Mosul, in northern Iraq, in an effort to protect them from
attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for Pentagon officials to disclose the extent of
aerial surveillance or to provide detailed accounts of the damage
caused by U.S. and British jets in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the United States has faced growing
international weariness with the repeated bombing of Iraq. There
was a sharp rebuke last week from the Foreign Ministry of France,
which until last year had contributed aircraft to the patrols of
the no flight zones where Iraqi planes are forbidden to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually detailed accounts, officials said, were an effort
to undercut sympathy that might be building for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has previously accused Iraq of using human shields
to protect weapons, knowing that U.S. and British pilots operate
under strict guidelines intended to avoid killing civilians. But it
was the first time the Pentagon offered photographic evidence of
such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. European Command, which oversees U.S. jets patrolling
northern Iraq, said the reconnaissance photographs showed two fully
armed missile launchers within 115 feet of homes in Mosul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The placement of these SAMs in civilian populated areas is
further evidence that the Iraqi military uses civilians as shields
for their antiaircraft artillery and other weapons that shoot at
coalition aircraft,'' a statement by the command said.
</P>
<P>
   The command also denied that U.S. jets based in Turkey had
attacked Baashiqah on Monday, killing two civilians, as Iraq had
reported. Instead, the command said, Iraqi antiaircraft artillery
had fired at allied jets from the town, which is 20 miles northeast
of Mosul, one of the major cities in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Shells from those batteries, the command said, fell to the
ground, exploded and caused the two deaths and another injury.
</P>
<P>
   The command did not elaborate on the source of this information.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with broad rules for responding to threats from Iraqi
jets, the pilots reacted to the artillery fire not by attacking the
batteries themselves but by striking a radar station near Saddam
Dam. That site, 28 miles west of Baashiqah, was also the target of
U.S. and British strikes on Aug. 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   Skirmishes like the one on Monday have occurred every few days
for nearly eight months, ever since President Saddam Hussein
declared that the no flight zones were a violation of Iraq's
sovereignty and vowed to defy the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies defined the zones after the
Persian Gulf War ended in 1991 to protect ethnic groups facing
repression from Hussein's government.

GOVERNOR BUSH, CONSIDER THE CASE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let's consider the stance of George W. Bush as
lock-'em-all-up tough guy. And let's apply his implacable hostility
to possessors and users of cocaine to a really bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sherlock Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know he never existed and was written into
turn-of-the-century London when the stuff was legal (here, too, by
the way). But the alleged wisdom of the governor's no-exceptions
sternness has to be apparent in all cases, hypothetical and
retroactive, or it makes no sense. Holmes is an appropriate
subject, not to excuse drug use but to understand it; using Sigmund
Freud, by contrast, would tax Governor Bush's reasoning powers
unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine Bush landing like a ton of bricks on a modern
incarnation of the greatest of all detectives, whom Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle portrayed as a guy with something of a habit that
affected no one but himself and was indulged regularly but not
constantly. Remember, you could find millions of Americans who do
or have done that, often when they were making ``mistakes'' as
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dr. John Watson's narration, we learn that Holmes was a
user when he was in between cases. In the early story ``A Scandal
in Bohemia,'' Doyle's Watson refers to Holmes's ``cold, precise,
but admirably balanced mind . . . the most perfect reasoning and
observing machine that the world has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that in his down time, Holmes was holed up on
Baker Street, ``alternating from week to week between cocaine and
ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his
own keen nature.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit later, in ``The Yellow Face,'' a disapproving Dr. Watson
said of the great man: ``Save for the occasional use of cocaine he
had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against
the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers
uninteresting.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ominous description begins ``The Sign of the Four,''
when Watson comes upon Holmes shooting up, which the doctor says he
has been doing three times a day for many months in this period.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine or cocaine? he asks. The latter, replies Holmes,
offering some to Dr. Watson, calling it ``a seven percent
solution'' (hence the title of the second-rate movie decades
later).
</P>
<P>
   Watson berates himself for not ojecting more strenuously but
makes his point, which Holmes takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one,'' he
says. ``I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and
clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter or
small moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But consider the cost,'' argues Dr. Watson. . . . Why should
you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great
powers with which you have been endowed?''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes counters that it's no big deal, because when his mind is
attacking difficult problems, ``I can dispense with artificial
stimulation.''
</P>
<P>
   So should our modern Holmes be locked up for felony possession?
Or should Doyle's works be banned from school and public libraries
as dangerous propaganda? Should tolerance in British detective
yarns be limited to Agatha Christie, who in ``The Labors of
Hercule'' is more careful to note that in addition to exhilaration,
``take too much of it and you get violent mental excitement,
delusions and delirium''?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, and I'd bet Bush would agree.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Felony possession, in practice, is not a charge aimed at the
discreet or at well-off, well-connected young people making
mistakes. It's a bullet aimed at poor kids on the street, more
often black or Hispanic kids; in practice the bullet's purpose is
to force users to give up suppliers, but that doesn't blot out the
fact that by the thousands people languish in prison who have never
posed any threat to any law-abiding citizen. Many of them need help
and want desparately to stop using, but jail cells outnumber
treatment program slots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's weird behavior to date has nothing to do with his
qualifications to be president, no matter what he did 'twixt 18 and
28, any more than Holmes's admitted using of cocaine affected his
ability to be a brilliant problem-solver. But Bush's selective
claims and selective silence knock the legs out from under his
ability to discuss an extremely serious problem in this country
without evoking legitimate snickers. And hypocrisy lurks in the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SUED OVER NOT PAYING OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Workers for a large and well-known employer in the
nation's capital have accused their bosses of juggling the books to
cheat them out of overtime pay in violation of the law and then
lying about to it to conceal the illegality. Sounds like a case for
the Justice Department, except in this instance the employer is the
Justice Department, the agency charged with enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a federal judge said the court would ask more than
12,400 current and former Justice Department lawyers whether they
wanted to join a class-action lawsuit filed last year by nearly 200
lawyers against the agency. The lawsuit seeks a half-billion
dollars for what the lawyers charge are millions of hours of
overtime that the department owes them.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly candid internal Justice Department documents have
been provided to the plaintiffs by the agency. They show that
department officials knew they were in violation, but kept, in
effect, two sets of books.
</P>
<P>
   One set, on which paychecks were based, required lawyers to
state that they worked 40 hours a week, no matter how much time
they actually put in.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials also kept a second set of records _
detailed, computerized time sheets that clocked overtime hours. The
records were used by superiors to measure their lawyers' effort, to
ask Congress for bigger budgets and even to bill legal fees to
losing adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are individuals who have devoted their professional
lives to enforcing the law,'' Robert A. Van Kirk, a lawyer at the
firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly who represents the Justice Department
employees, said, ``and, as a matter of principle, many object to
the nation's chief law-enforcement agency purposefully ignoring the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that the Justice Department ranked the 94
U.S. Attorneys' offices according to how many overtime hours were
worked in each office each month. The results were distributed to
supervisors who exhorted prosecutors, in some cases by name, to log
more overtime hours so the office would advance in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also show that Justice Department officials have
known for many years that lawyers worked more hours than the
official 40 a week and realized that a 1945 law, the Federal
Employees Pay Act, required the Justice Department and other
executive branch agencies to pay all employees overtime or to give
them compensatory time off.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is represented in the case by lawyers
from the civil division who have been granted a waiver from their
superiors to defend the agency even though they have a financial
stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials would not discuss the specifics of
the lawyers' case because of the pending litigation. But a senior
Justice Department official speaking on condition of anonymity said
that almost no lawyers at the department had ever expected to
receive overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The official questioned the applicability of federal overtime
statutes to Justice Department employees and said that it was
generally understood within the agency that only overtime
pre-approved by an authorizing official was eligible for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the official said, if the lawyers prevailed, the
culture of professionalism at the Justice Department would be
altered, forcing lawyers to work in the less desirable environment
of the hourly wage worker.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from seeking legislation to bar lawyers from being
paid for overtime, the Justice Department has not corrected the
problem, in part because of the administrative headaches, a work
ethic that regards lawyers as professionals who are expected to
work long hours, and the high cost of a fix, estimated to be $40
million to $50 million a year, or more.
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which has
jurisdiction over claims against the government exceeding $10,000,
is potentially embarrassing for the agency that routinely
prosecutes companies for infractions that seem no more serious. It
may also embarrass Attorney General Janet Reno, who in in-house
speeches has frequently emphasized her desire to make the Justice
Department a worker- and family-friendly workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with Justice Department lawyers suggest that
government lawyers, who once might have have been reluctant to sue
their employer, have gone to court because the overtime issue has
widened the gulf between their salaries and the hefty ones of
lawyers in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers fresh out of law school make about
$40,000 a year. The most battle-hardened Justice litigators make
about $125,000 a year, which is a little more than the beginning
salary for law school graduates who land jobs as associates at some
of the country's top private firms.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors. Although the government was once
thought of as a dignified public service refuge for lawyers who
wanted to avoid the high-pressure environment of private firms, the
working lives of lawyers at the Justice Department have changed in
recent years. Criminal, civil and appellate litigation is
increasingly complicated, stressful and enormously time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, many career lawyers have grown weary of putting
in punishing hours on a case without overtime or compensatory time
while some must submit a written request to take a few hours of
vacation time to attend a child's school event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to be an assistant United States Attorney,'' said
Kenneth C. Bauman, a veteran federal prosecutor in Portland, Ore.,
who has joined the class-action suit. ``I love my job. My job is to
enforce the laws of the United State adhering to the highest
ethical standards. I was surprised when this suit was filed and
later on when I was told that my employer, the Department of
Justice, had not followed the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Department administrators have told lawyers who work in
the agency's U.S. Attorneys' offices and at its Washington
headquarters that they are not entitled to overtime or compensatory
time. As the agency's manual said, ``Assistant U.S. Attorneys are
professionals and should expect to work in excess of regular hours
without overtime pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the law appears to say otherwise. Van Kirk's team has
uncovered internal memorandums dating back nearly 20 years in which
the Justice Department acknowledged that lawyers were entitled to
overtime pay. One review of the issue, in 1980, determined that
``attorneys, other than members of the senior executive service,
are entitled to overtime or compensatory time.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have uncovered a paper trail of documents that they
say indicate that the Justice Department has continued to violate
the law long after its officials plainly knew they were breaking
it.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1998 memorandum, a senior Justice Department lawyer, Fran
M. Allegra, addressed the issue. ``I believe it is problematic
(some might use the term unconscionable) for the department to
continue to not pay its attorneys overtime knowing full well that
the overtime statute applies,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a prophetic conclusion, Allegra wrote, ``In any event, if the
department continues to ignore this problem, sooner or later, an
intrepid attorney will develop a class action on this issue and
major problems will result.''

<P>
   In a move that could leave Canada with one major airline, a
Canadian conglomerate, with the help of American Airlines' parent
company, offered $3.8 billion in cash and stock Tuesday to buy Air
Canada and merge it with Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would significantly alter a slice of the North American
airline business. Travelers on Canadian routes would be left to
deal with a virtual monopoly, especially when flying to
destinations in eastern Canada. And the UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
unit could lose passengers to American, its key rival.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday how quickly this megadeal would take
place, if at all. The Canadian conglomerate, the Toronto-based Onex
Corp., said it would pay $5.54 (U.S.) for each Air Canada share, a
23 percent premium, or allow stockholders to swap their holdings
for an equal number of shares in Airco, a subsidiary that Onex had
formed for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The overtures by Onex _ and its chairman Gerald Schwartz, one of
Canada's most active deal makers _ received opposite reactions from
the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada's executives appeared to be surprised, saying in a
statement that the company was aware that an ``unsolicited
below-market offer'' had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Airlines appeared to roll out the red carpet for
Schwartz. The company's board of directors recommended that
shareholders accept Onex's offer of $1.34 or 0.2424 of a share of
Airco's stock for each of their shares. Kevin Benson, the chief
executive of Canadian Airlines, even said in a statement that if
the transaction were completed, it would result in a true national
airline for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enthusiasm from Canadian Airlines, analysts were
confident the deal would hit a few snags. It was not clear Tuesday
how receptive Canadian regulators would be to having one major
carrier, despite the financial woes both airlines have experienced
independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most immediate problem is that Onex's offer is probably
too low,'' said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley.
``Schwartz may have to raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forming one airline may be too big a headache even for Schwartz,
who has, among his many properties, major stakes in Sky Chefs, the
airline caterer, and Celestica, which sells automotive products.
Analysts said the new company, to be called Air Canada and
headquartered in Montreal, could face some labor unrest even before
it is formed.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz announced Tuesday that the combined company would
eliminate 5,000 jobs, mainly through attrition. While reductions of
that magnitude may woo analysts and investors, they tend to rile
union bosses, who are especially vocal in the airline industry. Air
Canada's pilots had a strike last year that cost the company some
$130 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger were to go through, the only other significant
airline competitor left in Canada would be Westjet, a 3-year-old
carrier based in Calgary that serves 11 cities in Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected troubles with the deal, analysts were
generally hopeful that it would be completed. Air Canada and
Canadian Airlines have wobbled financially for years, leaving some
observers to wonder if both can survive indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this deal happens, I think it's a good thing for Canadian
travelers,'' said Murphy. ``It ensures a strong industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Air Canada ponders Onex's offer, another feud appears to
be heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised AMR for committing $334 million to the proposed
Air Canada deal. AMR owns 33 percent of Canadian Airlines, a
statutory limit. If the deal is completed, Onex will own 31 percent
of the new Air Canada; AMR, 14.9 percent; and the public
shareholders, 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would American manage to protect its Canadian Airlines
investment, but the company could get a huge bonus with the deal.
The airline industry is rapidly dividing up into global alliances,
which allow its members to jointly sell flights and share frequent
flier miles within the group. If the Onex deal is completed, the
new Air Canada is expected to switch from the Star Alliance,
dominated by United and Lufthansa, to Oneworld, the alliance formed
by American and British Airways. The move would enable American to
sell seats on flights to all the new airline's destinations in
Canada, leaving United without a partner there.
</P>
<P>
   United may have other ideas. The company said in a statement
released Tuesday that it ``firmly intended'' to monitor carefully
any developments on Onex's and American's offer to acquire Air
Canada.

LABOR TENSION RISES AT FORD, EASES AT GENERAL MOTORS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Co. is
facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor
relations at the General Motors Corp. are finally starting to
improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials
and auto executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it
less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers
union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a
pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry,
they said. The UAW conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and
1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that
helped it and hurt GM and the Chrysler Corp., which has since
become part of DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Ford wants to sell or spin off its auto parts division and has
been reluctant to commit itself recently to building more vehicles
and engines at less efficient factories. Both moves have alarmed
local union officials, who have put pressure on the UAW's national
leadership to take a tough stance.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been negotiating lately to merge the auto parts unit
with the Lear Corp. as part of a complicated stock deal. Those
talks are now focused on finding a way to make sure that the
transaction is tax free, but no deal is likely until after the
expiration on Sept. 14 of the UAW's contracts with Ford, GM and
DaimlerChrysler, people close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears possible, although still not certain, that the
UAW will negotiate first this year with DaimlerChrysler, leaving
for later in the autumn the difficult issues at Ford and the
complicated but less contentious issues at GM. The union has taken
a renewed interest in the talks at DaimlerChrysler despite the
death earlier this month of Jack Laskowski, the union's vice
president for DaimlerChrysler issues.
</P>
<P>
   The talks at GM, while complicated and hard to resolve quickly,
have been going well. ``They seem to want to work with us,'' much
more so than in the past, said a UAW negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, said in an interview that he wanted to hold talks first with
Ford this autumn. This would make it unlikely that the UAW would
also negotiate first with Ford. The American and Canadian unions
have a history of not negotiating with the same auto maker at the
same time because the American union is so much bigger that the
Canadian union might then receive short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said that if the UAW chose Ford, he would most likely
choose another auto maker. But Hargrove works closely with the UAW,
and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford
so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the
UAW will not select Ford, although he added that he did not know
what the UAW would do.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union also tends to hold short strikes every three
years before reaching contracts, often against the first company
with which negotiations are held. That is mainly because Canadian
labor laws effectively prevent local units of unions from staging
walkouts in the middle of a contract. But the result may be to ruin
Ford's remarkable string of strike-free years.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McAlinden, the manager of automotive economic studies at
the University of Michigan and an adviser to the auto makers and
the UAW, said that the Canadian laws made it likely that Hargrove
would call a strike at Ford. ``It forces him to do some sort of
walkout every three years to show he has some teeth,'' McAlinden
said.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's contracts do allow such strikes for health and safety
reasons. UAW local units in Flint, Mich., cited such reasons a year
ago in a strike against GM that crippled the company's North
American operations for nearly two months and measurably slowed the
American economy during the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada and in the United States, the unions are demanding
substantial wage and pension increases in addition to continuing
the job security provisions that have been a staple of national
contracts over the last two decades. The auto makers are enjoying
record sales and have accumulated huge cash reserves _ $24 billion
in the case of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are doing very, very well,'' Hargrove said.
``The companies are making a lot of money and the workers are
entitled to share it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher wages would put Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler at a
disadvantage in competing with imports from countries like Korea
and Germany. But Japanese auto makers now assemble the majority of
their vehicles in the United States and tend to match wage
increases in Detroit so as to forestall unionization of their
American factories.

 &HT;    Bailey skips contempt hearing, rushes to bedside of critically
ill wife
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In 40 years of limelight trials, F. Lee Bailey's
presence in a courtroom seldom created more drama, consternation
and skepticism than his absence _ and the reason for it _ in U.S.
District Court here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameras and reporters waited in vain outside the federal
building for the famous defense lawyer who was scheduled to defend
himself against a contempt of court citation for refusing to turn
over $2 million belonging to a convicted client and claimed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the pugnacious legal lion in cowboy boots, U.S.
Magistrate James Glazebrook and federal prosecutors found
themselves facing owlish and soft-spoken Richard Lubin, pleading
for a humanitarian delay of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey had been called away from his hotel at 4 a.m. to the
bedside of his critically ill wife, Lubin said. Patricia Bailey,
56, had nerve-block surgery Monday at Indian River Memorial
Hospital in Vero Beach to relieve excruciating pain from pancreatic
cancer, Lubin said. But ``something had gone wrong with the
surgery,'' he said, and early Tuesday she was unconscious and
starting to experience organ failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors required that he be there,'' Lubin said. ``He is
in no condition to assist me or to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from Bailey's defense of infomercial king William
McCorkle, a former stripper, and his wife, Chantal, who were
convicted last year of fraud and money laundering. The jury that
convicted the McCorkles of swindling people with a get-rich-quick
real estate scheme ordered them to forfeit $10.6 million in assets,
including $7.1 million in Cayman Islands bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The government got $5.1 million from the accounts and demanded
the remaining $2 million, but Bailey said it was his for legal fees
and costs, and most had already been spent. Glazebrook ordered him
to pay $2 million into the court registry, Bailey refused, and the
judge set the contempt hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The McCorkles, who are appealing their 24-year prison terms, sat
through the hearing in ankle chains and bright orange jumpsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bailey spent 44 days in jail in Tallahassee in a
similar fight with the government, over $17 million in stock he
refused to turn over after representing Canadian drug dealer Claude
DuBoc. McCorkle loaned Bailey $100,000 to help him get out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   To pay off debts he'd accumulated by borrowing against the
stock, he mortgaged his 74-foot yacht Spellbound, and the $1.2
million home he and Patricia Bailey own in Manalapan.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's reputation for tricky legal strategy appeared to work
against him at first, as
</P>
<P>
   federal prosecutors were clearly skeptical about the last-minute
emergency plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is at a loss,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Marie
DeMarco said, noting that Bailey had filed motions to delay the
hearing on other grounds before bringing up his wife's medical
problems. ``We just don't know about her condition.''
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that Bailey had transferred $400,000 of the
Cayman Islands money into his wife's personal bank account in West
Palm Beach at one time.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco and Glazebrook both said the magistrate had admonished
Bailey repeatedly to get another attorney to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Glazebrook said he sympathized with Lubin, who'd had only two
days to review the complex case, but that was no grounds for
delaying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Bailey chose not to retain you in time, then his case
may be jeopardized by your inability to argue it on your feet,'' he
told Lubin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, Bailey had never mentioned his wife's medical
condition in all the grounds he'd cited trying to get the hearing
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who did not want to use that as a reason,''
Lubin said. ``This is a proud man. This thing took a horrible turn
... and just overwhelmed him. These are last ditch efforts to save
this lady's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Glazebrook recessed the hearing, called all the lawyers into his
chambers and had a private hearing in which he telephoned Patricia
Bailey's primary physician, Dr. Jeremy Geffen of the Geffen Cancer
Center and Research Institute in Vero Beach. Then Glazebrook came
back into the courtroom and postponed the hearing until Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question that Mr. Bailey needs to be
with his wife over the next few days,'' the magistrate said.
</P>
<P>
   The Geffen Center describes its program as a mixture of
conventional treatments _ surgery, chemotherapy, radiation _ with
alternative therapies such as nutrition, psychotherapy, massage,
acupuncture, and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bailey nor Geffen could be reached for comment late
Tuesday. Lubin said Bailey was in the hospital's intensive care
unit with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope,'' he said, ``so they're hoping she can
recover from this downturn and respond to treatment. That's all I
can say.''

</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point, its second increase in less than two months, to
help avert inflation while allowing the long economic expansion to

manufacturers, the Fed, which is headed by Alan Greenspan, raised
the target for the federal funds rate on overnight loans among
banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent and the discount rate on
loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4.75 percent from
4.5 percent.

world of color, nothing is just blue anymore. Increasingly it's not
even navy or sky or lapis. Crayola seems to now favor wholesome
all-American names, like Macaroni and Cheese (orange, of course)
and chestnut. When there are a bazillion shades of rose cosmetics
or crayons or paints on the market, giving them all specific,
sometimes strange names is a practical way to tell them apart.

 Raychem Lays Off 646 In Bay Area Consolidation
<TEXT>

 &QL; 
In one of the biggest Silicon Valley layoffs in recent years,
Raychem yesterday announced it will cut 646 jobs in Menlo Park,
Redwood City and Fremont as its new parent company begins
consolidating operations.
</P>
<P>
   The news came less than two weeks after shareholders of Menlo
Park-based Raychem approved a $2.9-billion buyout by Tyco
International, a fast growing conglomerate based in Bermuda. The
new owners are combining Raychem, which makes a diverse array of
wiring devices, fuses and other electronic components, with AMP, an
even larger component manufacturer acquired by Tyco earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 2,200 positions, half of them abroad, are to be
eliminated from the Raychem and AMP payrolls by the end of the
year. Most of the cuts will be completed by the end of September,
company officials said. Some local workers were shown the door
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   All of the jobs being eliminated in this area are white-collar
positions, according to company spokeswoman Maryanne Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Raychem is one of several large Bay Area employers that have
recently announced major job cuts. Last week disk drive maker
Quantum said it would lay off 750 to 800 employees, including about
600 in Milpitas, or about a quarter of its local work force.
Yesterday Quantum arch-rival Seagate Technologies chimed in with
news of 1,600 layoffs in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The new job cuts at Raychem come on top of 300 announced in
June. After the latest round of layoffs, the company will continue
to employ some 2,500 people in the Bay Area and about 7,000 total.
Together, AMP and Raychem will employ about 45,000 people
worldwide. Their combined sales will amount to about $7.2 billion
this year. Overall, Kane said, the companies expect that
``hundreds'' of employees whose jobs are scheduled for elimination
will be able to transfer into different positions on the
AMP/Raychem payroll. Those who are laid off will be offered
``generous'' severance payments, she said, but she refused to
provide details, citing privacy considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Workers knew they would find out yesterday who would go and who
would stay. ``I called this `the big day.' We knew for the last two
weeks we would find out today,'' said a Raychem saleswoman who did
not lose her job.
</P>
<P>
   Laid-off workers were given notice in the morning and had the
day to clean out their desks. In the parking lot, one worker left
behind a grocery bag containing a green lamp, a box of chocolates,
a bottle of wine and a crinkled old birthday card.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of RAYCHEM2 (16447 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Among those laid off, emotions were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were sad because they'd been there for a real long time,
15 or 20 years. It was like their family,'' said one female
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Others ``had been here for a long time and they wanted the
severance pay and, around here, it's not too hard to find another
job,'' a salesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Outplacement consultants were on site yesterday, helping
laid-off workers brush up their resumes and interviewing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The job reductions are part of a larger plan under which AMP and
Raychem operations will be reorganized into a series of integrated
business units defined by the market segments they serve, such as
communications, energy and automotive, Kane said. Products,
however, will continue to be sold under the AMP or Raychem brand
names.
</P>
<P>
   AMP President Jurgen Gromer will preside over the combined
operation. Former Raychem CEO Richard Kashnow will serve as
executive vice president for business development and investments.

FASHION MAGAZINE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATES WITH A BIG DEAL

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fashion magazine world consolidated Tuesday with
the agreement to sell Fairchild Publications Inc. to Advance
Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast. Advance will now be
the publisher not just of its current stable of Vogue, Vanity Fair
and Mademoiselle, but also of Women's Wear Daily, W and Jane.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the magazines was not disclosed Tuesday, but last
week executives at both Advance and Walt Disney Co., which owns
Fairchild, confirmed that Advance had offered $650 million,
outbidding Hearst Corp., its archrival in the magazine publishing
business.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney executives, apparently mindful of the potential value
of fashion news and photographs on the Internet, got Advance to
agree that Disney's Buena Vista Entertainment Group, which includes
Web sites like espn.com and abc.com, will retain the right to
publish articles and photographs from W, Women's Wear Daily and
Jane. A joint news release by the companies indicated a new women's
Web site might be the venue for the material.
</P>
<P>
   The news release also said that Disney and Advance ``have agreed
to explore forming an Internet joint venture using the content of
all appropriate Advance and Disney magazines.'' Spokesmen for the
two companies would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Disney struck a deal with Infoseek Corp.
combining Infoseek's search engine and other online assets with the
assets of the Buena Vista Internet Group. The combined company,
Go.com, is expected to issue a tracking stock that would reflect
the performance of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from keeping the Internet rights to the editorial material
of Jane, Women's Wear Daily and W for an unspecified period of
time, Disney is also keeping outright ownership of Los Angeles
magazine, the city magazine in its hometown.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday whether the deal, which was announced
late in the day, would permit Advance to offer advertisers a
multiple buy of advertising in all the fashion publications. The
remaining large competitors are Harper's Bazaar, published by
Hearst, and Elle, published by the Hachette Filippachi magazines
unit of Lagardere Group.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which must be approved by regulators, should be
complete ``by the end of the 1999 calendar year,'' according to the
news release.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Advance control of more fashion advertising
revenue than any of its rivals _ revenue amounting to hundreds of
millions of dollars annually.

 E-Loan Shares Up 27% After Forging Alliance With BofA
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;

<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Shares of E-Loan rocketed up 27 percent yesterday, the day after
the Dublin online mortgage company said it is expanding into auto
finance and forming an alliance with Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan's stock rose $6.38, to $29.75, on trading of 4.84 million
shares, nearly four times the average daily volume since the
company's initial public offering two months ago. That was still
far below $63, the stock's highest closing price, reached a few
days after E-Loan went public.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine out of a total of 13,900 trades in E-Loan's stock
yesterday were for blocks of 5,000 shares or more, according to the
brokerage firm Goldman Sachs. And only 3.5 million shares were sold
to the public in the June offering.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of large trades and total volume exceeding the
number of shares in public hands indicated that large institutions
played little part in yesterday's stock surge. Instead, it appears
to have been powered by small-time speculators who bought and, in
many cases, quickly sold E-Loan shares.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan said on Monday yesterday  &LR; that it had agreed to buy
CarFinance.com, the leading online auto lender, from BofA, which
owns 80 percent of the company's stock. In exchange, the bank will
get a 5 percent ownership stake in E-Loan, which already is the
largest mortgage company based on the Internet, though it is not
yet profitable.
</P>
<P>
   That move fueled a sense that the company is poised to dominate
two major categories of lending on the Internet and will have the
financial backing of North Carolina's BofA, the nation's largest
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors see E-Loan establishing a relationship with a major
financial institution,'' said J.H. Lee, a New York analyst with the
brokerage firm EBI Securities.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan and BofA plan to jointly develop new loan products to
sell over the Internet. ``We want the entire right side of the
consumer balance sheet, and we'll look at all opportunities in that
category,'' said E-Loan chief executive Chris Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   BofA already lends money to E-Loan, which the company uses to
fund consumer mortgages. Partnership with BofA offers ``favorable
and long-term access to capital,'' which should boost E-Loan's
profit margins, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they build an alliance, the two will continue to compete
as lenders. E-Loan funds mortgages and also acts as a mortgage
broker for other lenders, including BofA.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan's shares have been hurt recently by rising interest
rates, which tend to lower consumer demand for mortgages and erode
lender profit margins.

 Pac Bell to Offer Discount Deals
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Gearing up for its coming battle with AT&AMP;T, Pacific Bell said
yesterday that it will begin selling customers discounted packages
of telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Corp., the parent company of Pac Bell, plans to roll out
``bundled'' packages first in Fremont and Dallas and then expand
the offering throughout California and other SBC states.
</P>
<P>
   A ``significant part'' of the Bay Area will be able to buy the
discounted bundles by the end of the year, according to a Pac Bell
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to offer packages of services such as local
phone, wireless, satellite TV, high-speed Internet connections and
Internet service at prices that are lower than if customers bought
each service separately.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell also plans to offer long-distance service if and when
its application to be a long-distance provider is approved by
regulators. The regional phone company now has an application
pending with the state Public Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell is offering several ``Simple Solutions'' plans that
start at $34.95 per month for a package that includes local phone
service, voice mail and Caller ID. Subscribers to this package also
get to choose three other services such as call waiting and call
forwarding. Local phone service alone, excluding taxes and other
fees, is $11.25 per month.
</P>
<P>
   The $83.95-per-month plan bundle includes high-speed Internet
service using digital subscriber line technology, Caller ID and a
choice of three other phone services. Customers who buy this
package pay 31 percent less than if they bought all the services a
la carte, Pac Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is going slowly in its rollout so that it can keep
on top of demand, said Steve Dimmitt, Pac Bell vice president of
consumer marketing. Pac Bell could not keep up with demand for DSL
earlier this year after it cut the price for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's bundle is part of a growing trend among companies to
give customers one-stop shopping for all their telecommunications
needs.
</P>
<P>
   As competition heats up in the telecommunications industry,
companies are trying desperately to hold on to consumers, who tend
to jump to whichever provider offers the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Selling customers a multitude of services at a discounted rate
reduces the chance that customers will leave, because they have a
financial incentive to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you buy from a single company, the less tempted you
are to go away when somebody else offers a good deal,'' said Roger
Wery, executive vice president in charge of the communications
practice at Renaissance Worldwide, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a financial incentive, industry watchers say,
customers like bundles because they can go to one provider for all
their needs and get all their telecommunications services itemized
on a single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Dimmitt said that initially, customers who buy a bundle will get
local phone, Internet and digital subscriber line service on a
single bill. Wireless will be added before the end of the year, and
DirecTV, whose satellite TV service Pac Bell is reselling, soon
should be added to the package bills.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as AT&AMP;T and RCN Corp., also plan to offer
Bay Area consumers packages of local, long-distance, cable TV and
high-speed Internet access in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates caution that bundles are not for
everybody. Because they include so many items, customers need to
make sure they actually will use all the services they pay for in a
bundle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need to be cautious that they're really not adding
on additional features and services to their phone that, no matter
how much money you supposedly save, you would never use anyway,''
said Charles Carbone, consumer advocate with The Utility Consumer
Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Carbone said that before customers sign up for a package, they
should do an analysis of their bill to see which services they want
and need.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said Pac Bell's bundle is a direct swipe at
AT&AMP;T, which is testing its own local phone service in Fremont and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which bought TCI and is in the process of acquiring
MediaOne, plans to compete with Pac Bell and other regional phone
companies by offering local phone service over its cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Fremont is the only place where AT&AMP;T customers can
get local phone service via TCI's cable TV lines, but AT&AMP;T plans to
expand the trial to 10 cities _ including Pleasanton _ before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, AT&AMP;T is testing local phone service using ``fixed
wireless'' antennas that attach to the side of a customer's home.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as it finishes upgrading its cable network across the
country, AT&AMP;T plans to offer local phone service, high-speed
Internet access and cable TV as part of its own bundled package.
</P>
<P>
   In January, AT&AMP;T rolled out its Personal Network plan, which
costs $29.99 per month, plus 10 cents per minute, for all
long-distance, wireless and calling card calls, including those to
Canada, the United Kingdom and parts of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing Fremont for its first rollout, Wery said, SBC is
sending a message to AT&AMP;T that it's ready to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``SBC is clearly signaling to the market that they are going to
go after AT&AMP;T,'' Wery said. ``This is the first time that you see a
pretty broad suite of services and products offered by a regional
Bell operating company.''
</P>
<P>
   And while AT&AMP;T may have been first to market with its bundle,
industry watchers said, SBC's offering includes more immediate
services for consumers _ especially in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T offers long-distance as part of its package, but Bay Area
customers cannot get wireless service from AT&AMP;T. And it will be
awhile before the local phone product is rolled out to all
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell cannot yet offer long-distance, but is able to offer
wireless phone service and satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us what we believe is the right offering to compete
head-to-head against AT&AMP;T,'' Pac Bell's Dimmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials said Pac Bell's selection of Fremont ``doesn't
seem like a coincidence'' but said the competition will be good for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that Fremont has emerged as the center of
universe,'' said James Peterson, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T. ``But it
would appear that Pac Bell has discovered what we've discovered _
that customers want to be able to purchase bundles of telecom
services at reasonable prices.''

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   `Kidpreneurs' Can't Sign Contracts 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Please advise if there are age restrictions in forming companies
and, if so, how do ``kidpreneurs'' get around them? Can minors be
legally liable for business transactions?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are under 18 years of age, you are considered
incompetent from a legal standpoint, and it makes no difference if
you are the next Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child can't enter into a contract or be held responsible or
liable for a contract,'' says San Francisco attorney James Millar.
``If you are under 18, any contract you sign is not legally
binding.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean minors can't start business ventures any more
than it means they can't be child actors or money-making athletes.
</P>
<P>
   It just means they must have a parent or other guardian sign the
documents to establish the business, borrow the money, sign the
sales agreements and deal with all other contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Parents commonly are managers for their child actors and
athletes, and that's probably the first choice for underage
entrepreneurs. But Millar suggests that if the parent or parents
don't share the child's vision, it might be preferable to find some
other guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure it's someone you trust,'' advises attorney Mark
Radcliffe of the Palo Alto law firm Gray Cary Ware Freidenrich.
``Get the legal documents explained to you, don't sign away rights
for the rest of your life, and understand how the money is being
managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most kid entrepreneurs, from Web site designers to
lemonade stand operators, do not set up formal businesses or have
anyone sign contracts on their behalf. They simply do it, and
neither they nor their parents give much thought to potential legal
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids' enterprises fall below the radar screen,'' Millar
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   In case of a lawsuit against a young entrepreneur, the parent or
legal guardian could be subject to damages if the plaintiff
prevails. Such suits are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing for minors and their employers to consider are
strict laws governing underage workers. Self-employed minors are
not subject to California's permit requirements, but anyone under
18 who works for someone else should visit the state's Department
of Industrial Relations Web site at  &LR; www.dir.ca.gov/dlse &LR; 
 &LR; /childlabor.htm &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The site discusses work permits, age limitations for specific
jobs, and penalties for violations of the child labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Getting Known Online
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have established a Web site for our baby-products
business. But how do we get it noticed and attract customers
without spending a lot of money?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Whether you have a storefront or a Web site, generating
traffic still is the name of the game. The first step is to get
your site listed on search engines such as Yahoo, HotBot, Excite,
AltaVista, Infoseek, Go2Net/MetaCrawler, Ask Jeeves, LookSmart and
Google.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Heeter Lundquist, author of ``Selling Online for Dummies
(IDG Books, $24.99), says the easiest way to get your business home
page listed on online directories is to go directly to the various
search engine sites and apply to have your company's site added in
the appropriate product category. Such listings usually are free.
</P>
<P>
   To increase your venture's visibility further, consider trading
links with other retail or information sites that share a common
theme with yours or offer complementary products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them by phone or e-mail if they would be interested in
adding your site to their ``hot link'' list if you do the same for
them. You might set an expiration time for such a link, such as a
month or two, to test the concept.
</P>
<P>
   You also might scrape together some dollars to buy banner ads on
popular sites that can direct your pitch specifically to viewers
who click on baby products. Or you might advertise on a retail site
that caters specifically to young or expectant parents.
</P>
<P>
   The price of banner ads is based on ``impressions'' or page
views, and the cost typically runs from 2 cents to 15 cents per
impression. It is important that your ad is directed at the
appropriate audience.
</P>
<P>
   And Lundquist notes that ad innovation and rotation are crucial.
Like wary trout, if Web surfers don't bite (or click) after a few
casts, you've lost them.
</P>
<P>
   To improve your chances of making a sale, Lundquist says it is
helpful to post your customer service and privacy policies, company
history and partners, press clippings and testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   You also can use various services to track customer traffic as
well as manage and monitor your advertising. Once customers do
respond, be prepared to answer their e-mails and orders promptly.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Wild Brain Is Filling Airwaves
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By David Lazarus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
It isn't necessary to ask how business is going at Wild Brain, San
Francisco's leading animation studio. Artists, computer wizards,
directors and others occupy just about every available cubbyhole in
the company's 17,000-square-foot office in a former Inner Mission
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem,'' said chief executive Jeff Ulin. ``We're
OK at the moment. But as soon as the next big project hits, we'll
outgrow the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Wild Brain has a steady stream of projects, big and
small, in the works, so the lack of elbowroom will only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dilemma most young companies would kill for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had any quiet time,'' admitted Phil Robinson, Wild
Brain's vice president and one of three co-founders. ``There's
always more work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that work has been all over the airwaves in the form of
the animated Colonel in Kentucky Fried Chicken commercials. Past
ads have included ``Super Mom'' for Coca-Cola and spots for Nike,
Levi Strauss and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Wild Brain will resurrect one of the giants of the
advertising world _ the Jolly Green Giant _ in a major campaign for
Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   But animated commercials are only part of Wild Brain's
activities. Among other things, the company also has created
episodes for HBO's adult-oriented ``Spawn'' series and for Steven
Spielberg's DreamWorks Television, and produced its first animated
feature, direct-to-video ``FernGully cq &LR;  2: The Magical Rescue,''
for 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In the wings is an extensive Internet venture with a
high-profile partner. The Wild Brain folks don't want to tip their
hand too quickly on this, but Ulin allowed that it would be
``something complementary'' to the firm's existing animation
business.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Brain came into being about five years ago when Robinson,
John Hays and Jeff Fino _ who all worked at various times for
Colossal Pictures, a San Francisco production house now on its last
legs _ agreed to pony up $5,000 apiece to launch their own company.
</P>
<P>
   The first job, animation for a computer game, arrived within a
week. Subsequent gigs quickly fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Wild Brain now has about 100 full-time employees,
with more coming aboard as various projects require. ``We've been
profitable every year of our existence,'' Ulin said, ``and have
grown every year in terms of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   He's projecting revenue growth of as much as 50 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, Pixar, headquartered in Richmond, last
month reported second-quarter income of $6.4 million on revenues of
$13.5 million. This was up from profit of $2.1 million and revenues
of $3.8 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the number of employees, Pixar is about four times
Wild Brain's size.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Wild Brain announced a $6.5 million
investment from Interfase Capital Partners, a new-media venture
capital firm. The money will be used for Wild Brain's pending
Internet initiative and to position the company as a leading player
in computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to say that Wild Brain never met a form of animation
it didn't like. From CD-ROMs to computer-generated images, the
company's artists, directors and producers are constantly on the
lookout for new creative outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``FernGully 2'' was perhaps Wild Brain's most important turning
point to date. Delivering a complete feature film on time and on
budget confirmed that the studio can handle ``long-form'' projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us less than a year and a half,'' said co-founder
Fino. ``It was a real lucky break. But the ultimate goal always has
been to create our own properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild Brain is doing just that with a 26-episode original series
tentatively titled ``Poochini's Yard.'' Based on an award-winning
short film, ``A Dog Cartoon,'' which tells the story of a dog and
his favorite bone, the series represents Wild Brain's first major
long-form endeavor developed entirely in-house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poochini's Yard,'' which may remind some viewers of the
slapstick, anything-goes Looney Tunes from Warner Bros., is being
co-produced by Germany's EM.TV, which will handle international
distribution of the series. Wild Brain is now seeking a domestic
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the long-form projects to be the anchor,'' said
co-founder Hays, who also serves as president of the company.
``Feature films are the real goal. They allow us to do our craft on
a higher scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild Brain has a number of feature-length projects in various
stages of development, including a production for Nickelodeon
described by Hays as ``American mythology with a slight Western
angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works is a computer-generated short film intended in
part to serve as a training ground for a similarly produced
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be a recognizable Wild Brain style in the company's
animated movies? On this point, all the company's bigwigs
unanimously agree: no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our studio is strong because we do a lot of styles,'' said
Fino. ``You can't look at something we do and see a Wild Brain
look. Some marketers may think this isn't a good thing, but we do.
We can do every style.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who recently completed animated sequences for the
upcoming live-action film versions of ``Dudley Do-Right'' and
``Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' sees Wild Brain charting a course between
``traditional'' two-dimensional animation and the
computer-generated 3-D stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of the sort of work that catches his fancy, he cited
Disney's latest, ``Tarzan,'' and director Brad Bird's ``The Iron
Giant.'' Both films combined rich, hand-drawn techniques with
swooping 3-D landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The two movies also offered another lesson. Despite glowing
reviews for each, ``Tarzan'' packed in crowds via Disney's vast
marketing machinery, while ``The Iron Giant'' has done relatively
little business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to have a good idea and tell it well,''
Robinson concluded. ``You also have to market and strategize it.
You have to get the enthusiasm of the big studios behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wild Brain has proven more than adept at playing nice with
corporate clients, it remains to be seen how cooperative the
company will be when its creative vision is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the company's leaders see Wild Brain's free
spirit and independence as advantages and insist that they expect
to work with any and all partners, as opposed to Pixar's exclusive
relationship with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood generates these big projects, a lot of executives
get involved and decisions get made by committee,'' Robinson said.
``These are the juggernauts that end up hosing money down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to make films without that huge budget overhead and
layers and layers of executives. We've learned how to do things
leaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild Brain's business associates are quick to sing the company's
praises. ``They're top echelon,'' said Matthew Anderson, who
produced the Kentucky Fried Chicken spots for the Young &AMP; Rubicam
advertising agency in New York. ``They're really mellow,
fun-to-work-with people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of their creative approach and the way they do
things, they're one of the top animators we've worked with,'' said
Joe Stanley, senior vice president of Dailey &AMP; Associates in Los
Angeles, which tapped Wild Brain for a series of Willy Wonka candy
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Such raves hopefully will continue as Wild Brain approaches a
near-inevitable public offering of its shares. While no such plans
have been announced, CEO Ulin revealed that he's already pondering
the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing and events are starting to overtake us,'' he
said. ``We're exploring the feasibility of growing further.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Ulin will be the first to concede: Wild Brain is going to
need a bigger office.

DISCOVER AND DREYFUS WILL BEGIN AFTER-HOURS STOCK TRADING
WEDNESDAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two more online brokerage firms have struck an
agreement to offer customers after-hours stock trades, beginning
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Discover Brokerage, the online unit of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., and Dreyfus Brokerage Services, a division of Mellon
Bank, plan to begin allowing small investors to trade in some of
the most active Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange issues from 6
p.m. to 8 p.m. The result will be an evening session after the
major exchanges close at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Discover, which ranks ninth in average daily trades among online
brokers, and Dreyfus, a much smaller player, will use MarketXT,
formerly known as Eclipse Trading, a new after-hours electronic
trading network backed by Morgan Stanley and several large trading
firms.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a flurry of activity in recent weeks among online
brokerage firms and electronic trading networks, which say they are
paving the way for 24-hour electronic stock trading and aiming to
offer small investors all the advantages and conveniences that
institutions have long enjoyed, such as trading on news announced
after the markets close.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the Chicago Stock Exchange said it would offer
after-hours trading to smaller investors in October, making it the
first exchange to do so. ETrade Group, the giant online brokerage
firm, and Instinet, the electronic trading network owned by Reuters
Group, said days earlier that they would join forces in September
to offer trading from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Datek Online Holdings
already offers trading in Nasdaq stocks from the close until 5:15
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firms say small investors are eager to trade
cheaply and conveniently over the Internet. Some live on the West
Coast _ where the New York markets close at 1 p.m. local time _ and
others simply prefer the convenience of trading from home, after
the markets close.
</P>
<P>
   So while the major stock exchanges _ the Nasdaq Stock Market and
the New York Stock Exchange _ are contemplating an evening session,
a number of alliances are being formed among online brokerage firms
and so-called electronic communications networks, or ECNs, which
are low-cost computerized trading systems, which are fast winning
acceptance as efficient ways to sort and match orders. Experts says
it is unclear whether several after-hours systems acting
independently of one another will attract enough orders for
customers to get good prices and whether there is truly sufficient
demand for such service.
</P>
<P>
   In the Discover and Dreyfus alliance, customers will have their
Internet trades directed to MarketXT, an electronic system that
will be supported by market makers at Morgan Stanley; Herzog Heine
Geduld, and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, creating a
kind of hybrid stock exchange with both electronic and human
components.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, MarketXT will have its first trial, said
Michael O. Sanderson, chief executive at MarketXT Inc., which is
based in New York. ``We'll have three market makers generating live
quotes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be able to trade in the 200 stocks that make up
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 100 and the Nasdaq 100 _ among the most
popular issues available, Monday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. O'Connell, the president and chief operating officer
of Discover, based in San Francisco, said the system would only
accept limit orders, meaning an order to buy 100 shares of
Microsoft must be accompanied by a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be dominated by hedge funds or institutional
traders,'' O'Connell said. ``This was totally developed and
conceived with the individual investor in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Discover, one of the nation's fastest-growing
online brokers, say that there has long been a need for after-hours
trading. For more than a year, 25 percent to 40 percent of the
brokerage firm's online orders have been placed after the markets
close, they say. Those orders sat and waited in an electronic queue
until the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. the next day. Now, investors
will be able to ask that their trades be executed well past dinner
time.

 _ SF CHRON   San Francisco Hotel Strike A Possibility 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Steve Ginsberg &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The operators of 11 of San Francisco's largest hotels will try to
stave off a strike by its union employees with another round of
labor negotiations scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Casey, president of Local 2 of the Hotel and Restaurant
Workers union, warned that a strike could come as early as next
month, during the height of the convention season.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents room cleaners, dishwashers and
restaurant workers, has voted overwhelmingly to authorize their
negotiating committee to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union's five-year pact with management that expired August
14 affects 8,000 workers at 50 hotels and motels in the city. A new
agreement with 11 of the city's largest hotels would set the
guidelines for workers at the remaining 39 hotels and motels.
</P>
<P>
   The union is planning a demonstration Friday in Union Square to
air its complaints. Casey said there also is a campaign under way
to make travel agents, corporate executives and hotel customers
aware of the workers' plight.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hotel strike in San Francisco occurred in 1980
when the hotel workers union struck several hotels for a month and
cost the city well over $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the hotel workers union struck the Mark Hopkins, the
only major hotel targeted during the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the two sides in the current dispute are
far apart on wages, workloads and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants to raise its employees' hourly wage rates from
$12 to at least $13.50. Union officials say management has not made
a wage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The union also says management is attempting to maintain health
benefits at current levels. The union said many of its workers,
especially room cleaners, who represent 40 percent of the union
workforce, suffer from repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward a new contract has been slow. Union spokeswoman
Valerie Lapin said management did agree to double pension
contributions to between $700 and $800 a month.
</P>
<P>
   One hotel operator who requested anonymity insisted that San
Francisco hotel workers already are the nation's highest paid and
that the companies can't afford the increases. They say their
occupancy rates peaked in 1997 and have fallen each year since.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial union demands calls for the new
owners of acquired hotels to keep the union workforce.
</P>
<P>
   The union lost the Sir Francis Drake hotel when it changed hands
in 1997 and has been unsuccessful in organizing there since.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are with 11 of the city's Class A hotels,
including the Westin St. Francis, Sheraton Palace, the Fairmont and
Hyatt Regency and Grand Hyatt. The San Francisco Marriott is not
included.
</P>
<P>
   Should there be a strike, Casey said it would be selective,
targeting one or a few high-profile properties to maximize impact.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Korshak, the hotel operators' chief negotiator and a Los
Angeles attorney, was unavailable for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is one of San Francisco's biggest industries. In 1998,
the city's hotels hosted 4.2 million visitors who spent $3.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this year, hotel occupancy in the
city was 76.4 percent, 1.2 percent more than it was a year ago,
according Smith Travel Research, a tourism industry consulting
company.

 _ SF CHRON   San Francisco Hotel Strike A Possibility 
<TEXT>

 &QL; 
The operators of 11 of San Francisco's largest hotels will try to
stave off a strike by its union employees with another round of
labor negotiations scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Casey, president of Local 2 of the Hotel and Restaurant
Workers union, warned that a strike could come as early as next
month, during the height of the convention season.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents room cleaners, dishwashers and
restaurant workers, has voted overwhelmingly to authorize their
negotiating committee to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union's five-year pact with management that expired August
14 affects 8,000 workers at 50 hotels and motels in the city. A new
agreement with 11 of the city's largest hotels would set the
guidelines for workers at the remaining 39 hotels and motels.
</P>
<P>
   The union is planning a demonstration Friday in Union Square to
air its complaints. Casey said there also is a campaign under way
to make travel agents, corporate executives and hotel customers
aware of the workers' plight.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hotel strike in San Francisco occurred in 1980
when the hotel workers union struck several hotels for a month and
cost the city well over $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the hotel workers union struck the Mark Hopkins, the
only major hotel targeted during the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the two sides in the current dispute are
far apart on wages, workloads and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants to raise its employees' hourly wage rates from
$12 to at least $13.50. Union officials say management has not made
a wage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The union also says management is attempting to maintain health
benefits at current levels. The union said many of its workers,
especially room cleaners, who represent 40 percent of the union
workforce, suffer from repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward a new contract has been slow. Union spokeswoman
Valerie Lapin said management did agree to double pension
contributions to between $700 and $800 a month.
</P>
<P>
   One hotel operator who requested anonymity insisted that San
Francisco hotel workers already are the nation's highest paid and
that the companies can't afford the increases. They say their
occupancy rates peaked in 1997 and have fallen each year since.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial union demands calls for the new
owners of acquired hotels to keep the union workforce.
</P>
<P>
   The union lost the Sir Francis Drake hotel when it changed hands
in 1997 and has been unsuccessful in organizing there since.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are with 11 of the city's Class A hotels,
including the Westin St. Francis, Sheraton Palace, the Fairmont and
Hyatt Regency and Grand Hyatt. The San Francisco Marriott is not
included.
</P>
<P>
   Should there be a strike, Casey said it would be selective,
targeting one or a few high-profile properties to maximize impact.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Korshak, the hotel operators' chief negotiator and a Los
Angeles attorney, was unavailable for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is one of San Francisco's biggest industries. In 1998,
the city's hotels hosted 4.2 million visitors who spent $3.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this year, hotel occupancy in the
city was 76.4 percent, 1.2 percent more than it was a year ago,
according Smith Travel Research, a tourism industry consulting
company.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Most cities root unabashedly for their big
hometown companies. But here _ where Northwest Airlines has its
headquarters, employs 21,000 and controls 80 percent of the airline
seats out of the city _ many people are rooting for Sun Country
Airlines, a small local charter airline that started flying a
regular schedule to a mere 15 destinations in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northwest is doing anything it can to put Sun Country out of
business,'' said the Rev. Brian Kimbler, a pastor in Brainerd,
Minn. He recently flew with Sun Country to New York with his wife
and a group of eight teenagers from his church, paying $228 apiece,
below Northwest's advanced-purchase fare of $308 and a world away
from its $1,200 midweek round-trip fare. ``I like competition,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hatch, Minnesota's attorney general, also likes
competition. In January, after Sun Country said it would begin
scheduled service, he sent a letter to John H. Dasburg, Northwest's
chief executive, putting him on notice that the attorney general's
office would be watching the airline's reaction to Sun Country. For
local news organizations, the David-versus-Goliath battle between
the two airlines has been one of the biggest stories of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation in Washington, after being
alerted by a letter from Hatch in April, told Northwest, the
nation's fourth-largest airline, to report each competitive action
it takes in relation to Sun Country.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest says that such scrutiny is unwarranted. ``The impetus
here is not to penalize or punish Sun Country,'' said Douglas M.
Steenland, executive vice president and general counsel at
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the support Sun Country is receiving, its
experience shows how difficult it is for a small airline to make it
in head-to-head competition with one of the industry's giants at
its so-called fortress hub.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS)
</P>
<P>
   Scores of new airlines have been started since the industry was
deregulated in 1978, but only one _ America West Airlines, a unit
of the America West Holdings Corp. of Tempe, Ariz. _ has managed to
enter the ranks of the majors. The rest have struggled to stay
alive or have folded, either as a result of mismanagement, ruthless
competition from the major airlines or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same two decades the industry has consolidated into a
cadre of giant competitors, each of which dominates one or more of
the nation's major airports, where they are able to charge premium
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Northwest and Republic Airlines each carried
roughly 40 percent of the passengers in the Twin Cities. But in
1986, Northwest bought Republic, giving the airline a dominant
position overnight.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the General Accounting Office found that fares
in Minneapolis were, on average, 49 percent higher than those at
comparable airports where there is competition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIMS)
</P>
<P>
   Northwest now controls 54 of the 70 gates at the main terminal
of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, forcing Sun Country
to use the Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal, a converted hangar on the
opposite side of the tarmac. That and Sun Country's comparatively
limited schedule make it difficult for the airline to attract the
lucrative business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Country executives say that Northwest has matched its low
fares on routes where the two compete and has even added flights on
some competing routes. They also say that Northwest has threatened
to retaliate against travel agents who book flights on the airline
and has even stopped sharing spare parts with the airline, a
courtesy commonly extended between airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest denied pressuring travel agents and said that it had
matched Sun Country's low prices selectively, leaving in place many
of its higher walk-up fares. It said it had stopped sharing parts
with Sun Country, but only because Sun was asking for so many.
</P>
<P>
   Steenland added that Sun Country likes to present itself as a
struggling upstart but is really a potent competitor because its
owners, the La Macchia family, also own the Mark Travel Corp. of
Milwaukee, one of the biggest package-tour companies in the
country, with more than $1 billion in annual sales. (Northwest's
revenues last year were $9 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to competing primarily in the leisure markets of
Las Vegas and Orlando, they are the Goliath and we're the David,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS)
</P>
<P>
   Despite what it sees as Northwest's unfair tactics, Sun Country
is not giving up. In June, the airline announced that it would
lease six new long-range Boeing 737's to replace some of its aging
727's and to expand its fleet. Last week, Sun Country announced
that, beginning this fall, it would add a second daily flight to
Detroit and Milwaukee and expand its service from Minneapolis with
new flights to San Diego, Harlingen, Texas, and three Florida
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the gum stuck to the bottom of their shoe,'' said Bill
La Macchia Jr., 33, Sun Country's president. Then he paused and
added, ``And they just can't get us off.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIMS)
</P>
<P>
   Resentment against Northwest _ long referred to unaffectionately
here as ``Northworst'' _ has been simmering for years. It grew
after two outside investors, Alfred A. Checchi and Gary L. Wilson,
took it over in the early 1990s, loading the airline with debt in
the process. But the situation boiled over last fall when Northwest
pilots went on strike, shutting the airline down for 15 days and
stranding thousands of travelers all over the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike, calls went out from politicians and community
groups to find some way to relax Northwest's stranglehold on the
city. Sun Country and La Macchia stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Country, which is based in nearby Mendota Heights, started
as a charter airline in 1983, carrying gamblers to Las Vegas, Nev.,
and shoppers from around the country to Minneapolis' giant Mall of
America. The La Macchias decided to buy 75 percent of the airline
in 1997 to guarantee that flights would be available for their
package-tour company.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately, the purchase seemed to be a disaster.
Sun Country lost $11 million in 1997. Rather than let the airline
die, the La Macchias invested an additional $5.5 million to buy the
25 percent they did not own. ( La Macchia, whose father founded and
still runs Mark Travel, would not say how much the family paid for
its initial stake.)
</P>
<P>
   Sun Country was profitable in the first eight months of last
year. But it went into the red in the last four months, when the
charter market traditionally declines. One of Sun Country's biggest
customers had been Northwest's package-tour company. But in recent
years, La Macchia said, especially after Sun Country quietly
started offering some scheduled flights in 1996, Northwest began
steering more business to its own charter airline.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest strike convinced La Macchia that he could balance
Sun Country's wobbly revenues by expanding scheduled service and
promoting it heavily. ``Northwest, with its lock on this market,
really presented the company with an opportunity,'' said Paul
Miller, a Northwest veteran who is now Sun country's vice president
for market planning.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Sun Country began a newspaper advertising
campaign claiming credit for bringing low fares to Minneapolis and
offering the chance to win free flights for a year. The airline
received more than 80,000 responses, including many handwritten
notes of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill, it would be great to fly out of Minneapolis and be
treated like a paying customer, not a
take-it-or-leave-our-service-stinks attitude like Northwest!,'' one
correspondent wrote. ``And I am a gold member at Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   La Macchia, who spent 10 years working for Mirage Resorts, Inc.
in Las Vegas, has followed in the footsteps of his old boss, the
casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn, by starring in his company's ads.
</P>
<P>
   A first set of arch television spots shows La Macchia going door
to door in a white shirt and tie, introducing himself to mystified
Twin Cities residents. ``All we want to do is make air fares
reasonable,'' La Macchia tells one indifferent housewife. ``Our
walk-up fares are very reasonable,'' he explains to two young boys,
as the three sit on a curb licking popsicles.
</P>
<P>
   La Macchia's strategy is to offer superior service at a lower
price. Customers are not penalized for buying one-way tickets and
are not required to stay over a Saturday night to get a low fare, a
feature designed to appeal to business and other travelers who are
forced to pay exorbitant fares for last-minute travel during the
week on large airlines.
</P>
<P>
   If a recent flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport
to Minneapolis is any guide, the strategy may soon pay dividends.
``It's clean, it's nice, and it gets me there,'' said Don Eatz,
president of Monterey Fashions of Manhattan, one of the few
business travelers on board. He was skeptical at first but agreed
to fly Sun Country when he compared the $318 fare with a $1,200
fare on Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Several Sun Country employees also appeared to be happy with the
new management. Cathy Steffens, a flight attendant, joined Sun
Country in 1989 after 20 years at Northwest. She said she was very
impressed with the changes at the airline under the La Macchias and
that morale was much higher at Sun Country than at Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the girls are grumpy and growly,'' she said of her
former Northwest colleagues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sun Country is also working hard to make the disadvantage of
being at the old Humphrey terminal into a plus. Though it is far
from the main terminal and has no rental car facilities, its small
size makes it easy to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   After coming under intense public pressure, the Minneapolis-St.
Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission, the public agency that
operates the Twin Cities airport and has long been seen as an
extension of Northwest, agreed this year to spend $73 million to
build a new Humphrey terminal that will be occupied primarily by
Sun Country in 2001. In the meantime, the commission earmarked
$450,000 to spruce up the existing terminal.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Sun Country's first month flying its new schedule, the
airline managed to fill 64.3 percent of the seats on its 15 jets,
while Northwest filled 80 percent of the seats on its fleet of 419
airplanes. James R. Olsen, one of Sun Country's founders and now
vice president for strategic planning, said that the July figure
was 70 percent and that the airline might be profitable for the
month of August.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that Sun Country can maintain that
performance in the fall, when leisure travel traditionally drops.
The airline is still little known outside Minneapolis, where 85
percent of its passengers now originate. It also does not offer
frequent-flyer benefits and must persuade skeptical travel agents
that it is a viable alternative to Northwest. Most Minneapolis
travel agents depend on Northwest for the bulk of their business
and receive incentives from the airline if they book more of their
passengers on Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Country plans to introduce a frequent-flyer program soon,
though La Macchia said it would not be like those offered by other
airlines. He explained that he wanted it to be more like the
``relationship marketing'' he learned in Las Vegas, with prizes
linked to local merchants, like pizza chains.
</P>
<P>
   Two Sun Country executives pointed out that it took five years
for Vanguard Airlines of Kansas City, Mo., and the Denver-based
Frontier Airlines, two other low-price airlines, to begin to show
profits. Are the La Macchias willing to wait that long?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely in this thing for the long haul,'' La
Macchia said. ``We are prepared to do what it takes.''

DISNEY TO BUY BIGGEST STAKE IN ONLINE TOY RETAILER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DISNEY-FAIRCHILD) 
(mk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giving a major lift to a small online retailer of educational
toys, Walt Disney Co. is expected to announce Wednesday that it has
bought a majority stake in Toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Buena Vista Internet Group, which oversees Disney's
Internet properties, indicated the company would have a 60 percent
stake in Toysmart. Disney would not say how much it paid for the
stake, citing regulatory restrictions in advance of a planned sale
of shares in the Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   But one electronic commerce analyst, David Cooperstein of
Forrester Research, said Disney had paid $20 million and would also
provide Toysmart with another $25 million in free advertising. The
ads would appear on the Go Network, which includes ESPN.com and
ABCNews.com, and on media outlets like the Disney Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Davis, president of electronic commerce for Buena Vista,
said the company would promote Toysmart heavily through its
Family.com site, which offers articles and advice on parenthood and
has roughly 3 million visitors a month. Family.com will recommend
Toysmart merchandise in its editorial areas, Davis said, while
Toysmart will use Family.com's editorial content in various areas
of its site.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said Toysmart would retain control over the site,
including decisions about which toys to sell. Analysts said this
would improve the site's chances of success, since Disney could
erode Toysmart's value if it insisted on promoting its own toys _
some of which are not educational _ through Toysmart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing extensive online promotion for
Toysmart, said Cooperstein of Forrester, ``Disney gets more people
spending more money through its network.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lord, Toysmart's chief executive, said the company defined
``educational'' toys as any products that are ``developmental, high
quality, fun, and open-ended,'' meaning they let children be
creative.
</P>
<P>
   Such toys make up 38 percent of the $23 billion toy market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Toysmart uses the Disney relationship to promote its
brand name, the site will broaden its offerings beyond educational
toys. Lord said that in the coming months Toysmart will sell
children's furniture and baby products, increasing the number of
products offered from 20,000 to 75,000 by November.
</P>
<P>
   When it does that, the company will provide competition not only
to major online toy retailers like Etoys and Smarterkids.com, but
also to sites like iBaby, a division of iVillage, which stock a
wide range of products for children, and to traditional outlets
like Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that in concept, at least, the prospects for an
online retailer of educational toys are promising. First, the toys
are highly profitable _ Toysmart anticipates margins of 40 percent,
versus 20 percent to 30 percent for mass-market toys sold online _
because they appeal to highly educated and affluent parents who are
willing to pay more. Second, because of the toys' high prices,
major chains have been reluctant to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the market for these toys through traditional
channels has been fragmented, with small chains like Noodle
Kidoodle catching on in some areas but failing to create a national
presence. This week one such retailer, Zany Brainy Inc., announced
a loss of 15 cents a share, after a loss of 80 cents in the
comparable quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For a company that started in January and began its first ad
campaign just last week, Toysmart has been a surprisingly hot
property. Toys ``R'' Us, which has failed to develop a successful
e-commerce strategy, had sought to acquire Toysmart but failed
because it insisted on controlling merchandise decisions,
Cooperstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Lord started developing the idea for Toysmart in 1997 when he
was chief executive of Holt Educational Outlets, which sells
products like audio-visual equipment to teachers and corporations.
After creating an educational toys division at Holt, he left the
company, bought the division in December and changed the name to
Toysmart.

FEW STATES ARE USING SETTLEMENTS IN TOBACCO SUIT TO CUT SMOKING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky., N.C., Mass., Ore., Calif., Fla., Hawaii, Minn., Md.,
Vt., Wash., Texas, Miss.)   (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite overwhelming evidence that anti-tobacco
campaigns reduce smoking, most states are in danger of wasting an
opportunity to fight death and disease with money from the tobacco
industry, federal health officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only six of the 46 states that participated in last year's $206
billion settlement with tobacco companies have made major
commitments to use their windfalls to cut down on tobacco use, Dr.
Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, told a conference in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The hesitation is especially frustrating because statistics show
that aggressive anti-smoking efforts sharply lower the ranks of
tobacco users, Koplan told the National Conference on Tobacco and
Health in Kissimmee, Fla.. ``We have nothing to show when we
prevent something,'' he said. ``All you can show are fewer
smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   And fewer early deaths from lung cancer, his colleague Dr.
Michael Eriksen added in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health,
said the states must wrestle not just with a public-policy
question, but something more basic: ``This raises fundamental
issues about where your moral values are.''
</P>
<P>
   To Koplan and Eriksen, the statistics are irrefutable. They
cited California, Massachusetts and Oregon, where higher tobacco
taxes were enacted in recent years after anti-tobacco advertising
and educational campaigns were undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita cigarette consumption declined 16 percent in
California from 1992 to 1996, the officials said, and 20 percent in
Massachusetts for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, probably the state whose economy is most dependent on
tobacco, has the highest smoking rate in the nation, Eriksen said.
In 1996, nearly 26 percent of adults in the state smoked, and 47
percent of students in grades nine through 12 reported having
smoked in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deplorable that we have the highest youth-smoking rate,
but understandable given our culture,'' said Amy Barkley, head of
Kentucky Action, a tobacco-control coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is second only to North Carolina in tobacco production,
but Kentucky's economy relies on it more; two-thirds of the farms
in the state grow tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC provide detailed recommendations for states on how to
combat tobacco use. The greatest emphasis is on preventing smoking
among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The six states that the agency said had made anti-tobacco,
public-education commitments in line with its recommendations are
New Jersey, Hawaii, Vermont, Minnesota, Maryland and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _
entered into earlier settlements with the tobacco companies. The
settlements, arising from the public-health costs associated with
tobacco use, are to be paid out over 25 years. (New York is to get
about $25 billion, New Jersey $7.6 billion and Connecticut $3.7
billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The states are not bound to use their settlement money fighting
tobacco, or on health programs in general, for that matter. They
can use it to build schools or to reduce debt _ all worthy goals,
Eriksen conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he said, they can use it to help people live longer. Unless
things change, Eriksen said, five million Americans who are under
18 will die prematurely because they smoke.

COMMENTARY: KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I will never forget the shock of hearing dirty
talk in the Senate for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A pubic hair on a Coke can ... Long Dong Silver ... bestiality
movies.
</P>
<P>
   I looked around the Senate Judiciary hearing room. Jaws were
slack, if not dropping.
</P>
<P>
   The stricken senators listening to Anita Hill on that October
day in 1991 looked as if they wanted to dive under the green felt
skirts of the dais, or stick bags over their heads. How could such
graphic sexual language crack that marble dignity, in the same room
where Congress investigated the sinking of the Titanic, the bombing
of Pearl Harbor, Watergate and Iran-Contra, and where Joe Welch
once demanded of Joe McCarthy, ``Have you no sense of decency,
sir?''
</P>
<P>
   Decency blushed during the Thomas-Hill hearings. There was a
sense that weekend that the scalding spectacle would not end until
one of the combatants was fatally gored.
</P>
<P>
   So it was again in the bitter contest between Ken Starr and Bill
Clinton, when Senate dirty talk made Thomas-Hill look like Disney.
By the time they got to the 1998 sex scandal, the Democrats were
wiser and meaner. They applied the ruthless, truthless lessons they
had learned watching Republicans in the Thomas hearings: Save your
guy at any cost. Only the appearance of the Gap dress interrupted
the Clintonite whispers that, as the Republicans once said of
Anita, Monica was an erotomaniac, a little nutty and a little
slutty.
</P>
<P>
   After the wild ride of the Clinton years, what shocked us in
1991 is no longer shocking enough. ``Strange Justice,'' the new
Showtime movie recreating the Thomas-Hill imbroglio that premiered
in Hollywood Tuesday night (based on the book by my friends Jane
Mayer and Jill Abramson, a New York Times editor) has goosed up the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The docudrama or adaptation _ cutting and pasting history and
fiction, real news clips and interpretive dramatizations _ features
a bizarre scene in which Clarence Thomas, played by Delroy Lindo,
rips off his shirt during his Senate testimony and prances around
half-naked and barefoot. When he utters his famous ``high-tech
lynching'' line, Lindo uses his tie as a noose.
</P>
<P>
   The prim and stoic Anita Hill, played by Regina Taylor, is given
more ratings oomph here _ with flashes of anger and trails of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors tried to give three-dimensional portraits of these
icons,'' said Jacob Epstein, the screenwriter and executive
producer. ``They may not have been representational portraits. They
were figurative and impressionistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reviews have praised the movie's edgy style, not
minding the imaginary flourishes that the film makers ``cooked
up,'' as Epstein put it.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch both bought the rights to the book
first and both chickened out of making the movie. Turner must not
have wanted to risk offending a Supreme Court justice. Murdoch, a
Thomas friend, killed the project as it was going into production.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime has won praise for daring to take on such a provocative
subject. And the movie convincingly portrays the Biden committee's
failure to call two other key witnesses who could have offered
evidence corroborating Ms. Hill, and the Bush White House's slick
packaging of an inexperienced judge.
</P>
<P>
   But it evades the truly ulcerous issue: One of these two people
told a monumental lie and got away with it. Showtime takes the easy
way, making the villain the cynical Washington process. Clarence
and Anita are merely two dignified people used by spin doctors and
partisan interests.
</P>
<P>
   With Rene Russo in ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' and the law vamps
on ``Ally McBeal'' exploiting sex for professional advantage,
feminine wiles are in fashion again. ``Strange Justice'' fits this
mood, treating sexual misconduct in the office as no-fault
behavior, a matter of Rashomon.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, during his grand jury testimony, volunteered that
although it seemed irrational, Thomas and Ms. Hill ``both thought
they were telling the truth ... you're dealing with, in some ways,
the most mysterious area of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a Bill &AMP; Monica movie in the works. We can
only hope that the actor playing the president keeps his shirt on.

PACIFIC CLASSIC FAVORITE BREAKS DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mazel Trick, who would have taken a four-race winning streak and
a ``rising star'' aura into Sunday's Pacific Classic, broke down
Tuesday morning at Del Mar as he sped through a scheduled 5-furlong
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The fractures in both sesamoid bones above the horse's right
front ankle will end the 4-year-old's promising career.
Veterinarian Helmuth Von blucher said it ``can be
life-threatening.... We'll see how it is in the next day or two.''
Surgery is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick, removed from the track in a horse ambulance, was
fitted with a splint and given a sedative. He remained in his stall
at trainer Bobby Frankel's barn late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' the colt will
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert was watching his horse General Challenge train at
the same time, and saw Mazel Trick's injury occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he passed the three-eighths (mile) pole, you could see he
took a bad step, and Chris McCarron pulled him up,'' Baffert said.
``Chris pulled him up quick, so maybe he has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a further blow to the $1 million Pacific Classic, which
lost Real Quiet and Victory Gallop to injuries in the past two
weeks. The favorites' role now goes to Malek, the 1998 Santa Anita
Handicap winner and the likely front-runner, and General Challenge,
the Santa Anita Derby winner who's the only 3-year-old in the
remaining field of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick was brought to California from France midway through
his 10-race, six-win career for new owners Audrey Skirball-Kenis,
her husband Charles and former Kentucky Gov. Brereton Jones.
Bone-chip surgery and laser treatments on both front ankles forced
a seven-month layoff.
</P>
<P>
   The layoff ended dramatically when Mazel Trick broke Hollywood
Park's 7-furlong record with a 1:19 4/5 clocking in winning the
Triple Bend Handicap in June and dominated the San Diego Handicap
at Del Mar on Aug. 7. His 4-for-4 record since switching from turf
to dirt tracks prompted comparisons to 1995-96 Horse of the Year
Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been a sound horse since I got him. I can't blame
the racetrack,'' Frankel said, alluding to criticism of the Del Mar
racing surface following a cluster of fatal breakdowns in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The expected field for the 1\-mile Pacific Classic: Malek,
General Challenge, Lazy Lode, Smile Again, River Keen, Barter Town
and Jack Grandi.

AMERICA ONLINE OFFERS FREE INTERNET SERVICE IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ America Online Inc. introduced its own free Internet
service in Britain on Tuesday, with the goal of overtaking the
growing crowd of competitors that already offer customers access to
the World Wide Web at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   The new service, known as Netscape Online, is managed by AOL
Europe, a joint venture of America Online and Bertelsmann AG, the
large German media conglomerate. First announced last month,
Netscape Online represents a strategic about-face for America
Online, which had historically relied on monthly subscriptions and
only three months ago questioned whether Britain's
free-subscription businesses could be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Netscape Online comes at a precarious time
for America Online in Britain, where its formerly large share of
the market has eroded.
</P>
<P>
   A main reason is the subscription-free newcomer Freeserve PLC,
which was created last September by Dixons Group PLC, a British
retailing chain, and in three months surpassed America Online as
Britain's most-used Internet service provider. Freeserve sold
shares of itself to the public a month ago in a bid to gain
financing for further expansion.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Netscape brand for the new service, America Online
hopes to differentiate it and not cannibalize its content-rich
subscription services like AOL U.K. and Compuserve. It is not only
going after Freeserve but the hundreds of other Internet service
providers that have sprung up around Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, America Online took out full-page advertisements in
almost all of Britain's national newspapers for its new service
with a headline that read: ``Beware part-time Internet providers _
the N is nigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Internet service business in the United States, where
access over a telephone line is relatively inexpensive, access in
Britain and in most parts of Europe can be quite expensive for
users because they must pay by the minute for local phone calls, in
addition to the charge levied by the Internet access provider. As a
result, subscription-free Internet services have emerged, luring
customers by not charging them the monthly subscription fee for
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the services share a percentage of the revenue
generated by the cost of a user's telephone call with the phone
company, which charges all calls by the minute. A subscription-free
service also derives revenue from advertising and electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called America Online's move a short-term solution to a
significantly longer-term problem, notably how America Online can
make money and how it can keep its higher-margin businesses from
losing customers to the subscription-free service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't answer the question of how AOL competes
internationally,'' said Evan Neufeld, vice president and director
for international research at Jupiter Communications in London. ``I
don't buy it as a long-term strategy to move the customers upstream
to their subscription services.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether subscription-free Internet services
are a passing fancy or are here to stay. As telephone companies
consider flat-rate pricing and upgrade their systems for faster and
more sophisticated connections, ``Netscape Online could be like the
flavor of the day,'' Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll all be talking about these wacky companies
offering free Internet access five years from now,'' he said.

 &HT;    Playoff return is Seanez's goal
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A stress fracture like the one in reliever Rudy
Seanez's right elbow normally takes six to eight weeks to heal. Six
weeks off would have Seanez returning from the disabled list just
in time for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez is cautiously optimistic about that possibility. ``Six to
eight weeks is the worst-case scenario,'' he said. ``Best-case
scenario is a couple weeks. If it doesn't happen then, I'll give it
two more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Working against him is the fear that if he pitches before his
arm is ready, he could blow out his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jeopardize my career, and I don't want to
jeopardize the team's chance to win,'' Seanez said. ``I don't want
to go out there if I'm not 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez said the arm started bothering him Friday night after he
pitched a scoreless inning against the Padres. It improved over the
weekend, but Seanez had had a similar injury and knew he should get
it checked out.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the Braves probably will turn to Russ Springer
and Mike Remlinger for the setup role.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm trained to do; that's what I've been doing the
last three or four years,'' said Springer, who had offseason back
surgery to repair a herniated disc. ``I started off the year in
rehabilitation, but I'm in a different situation now. I'm
physically able to do the job now. It's good enough to where I
don't think about it on the mound. I have days when I wake up and
it's stiff, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer earned his first save of 1999 Monday by throwing one
pitch to Eddie Taubensee and inducing a groundout.Bring in Cortes
</P>
<P>
   The Braves may have caught a break from the Rockies, who had
acquired David Cortes from the Braves last July as part of the Greg
Colbrunn deal. The Rockies thought Cortes had an arm problem, so
they returned him to the Braves and took Anthony Briggs instead.
The Braves are now calling on Cortes to fill in while Seanez is on
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said Cortes, a 25-year-old right-hander who
had 22 saves for AAA Richmond. ``I was hoping to get a call-up in
September. ...I'll just try to do the same thing here I was doing
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood said his back was feeling much better the day
after Monday's start and it would not limit him in his next start.
Millwood felt a twinge making a pitch in the fourth inning, which
is why he left after seven innings. ``It didn't hurt when I was
pitching; it hurt when I swung a bat,'' he said. ... The Braves
sent minor-league pitcher Joey Nation to the Cubs as the player to
be named in the July 31 trade for Jose Hernandez and Terry
Mulholland. Nation, a second-round pick in 1997, was 5-4 with a
4.39 ERA for Class A Myrtle Beach. ... The Braves have mailed out
playoff ticket applications to their 28,000 season-ticket holders.
The package includes applications for the Division Series, National
League Championship Series and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle and Tom Glavine will square off today in a meeting
of former Braves lockermates. Neagle said Glavine was probably his
closest friend on the Braves. ``It's always weird when you face
ex-teammates,'' said Neagle, who jokingly added. ``If I have to
drill him in the earhole I will.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a story about new musicals _ an ephemeral art
form _ and the recordings that make them endure.
</P>
<P>
   Theater critics have not been kind to new musicals in recent
years, nor have the musicals been especially kind to critics. You
would hardly know that, though, by the quantities of original-cast
albums that flood record stores and Internet music sites. Since
``Rent'' in 1995 _ the last show to garner anything close to
unanimous critical praise _ dozens of new musicals have come and
gone, on Broadway and Off, most to lackluster reviews. Yet so many
of them are available on compact disk. How did these shows come to
be recorded?
</P>
<P>
   Some record industry people would say it is a long-term bet.
Sales to the niche audience interested in new musicals (estimated
by the industry at about 5,000 hardy souls) barely justify the cost
of making a record. But the same creative team, even signed at a
loss, may one day produce a hit musical that will pay back expenses
and garner a sizable profit. That is the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is that a handful of recording executives
seem determined to preserve the sound of American musical theater _
even in its lean years, and without necessarily making a sizable
profit. In musical terms, they want the song to continue, and they
want the public to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, record companies have jumped on a hoped-for
Broadway blockbuster purely for profit, as Sony did with ``Side
Show,'' which faltered two seasons back; and Atlantic seems to have
virtually turned over its musical-theater division to the pop
composer Frank Wildhorn (``Jekyll and Hyde,'' ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'').
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, a significant majority of recent cast albums have
been produced by just three people operating at very different
companies: Bill Rosenfield, senior vice president for shows and
soundtracks at RCA Victor; Bruce Kimmel, a vice president and
producer at Varese Sarabande, a Los Angeles label largely devoted
to film soundtracks, and, to a lesser but no less influential
extent, Robert Hurwitz, the president of Nonesuch Records.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield, 45, is the executive behind the widest range of
original cast recordings, from big-budget extravaganzas like
``Ragtime'' to nontraditional works like ``Bring In da Noise/Bring
In da Funk,'' ``A New Brain'' and Stephen Sondheim's ``Assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   His reasons for recording a particular show often come down to
one word: ``Relationships,'' he emphasized in a recent interview in
his Broadway office overlooking Times Square. ``We know that to get
the smashes down the road, there have to be relationships
established with promising composers early on.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Nonesuch is better known for recording classical
music eccentrics and world music eclectics, like the artists on
``The Buena Vista Social Club,'' its hit Cuban music CD. But
Hurwitz, 50, also speaks about relationships when he explains his
commitment to the celebrated actress and singer Audra McDonald and
the rising young composer Adam Guettel, two highly promising if
commercially unproven prospects from the world of musical theater.
His label has released three recordings reflecting their work: Ms.
McDonald's solo debut album, ``Way Back to Paradise,'' and the
musical ``Floyd Collins'' as well as the song cycle ``Myths and
Hymns'' by Guettel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every area in which we record,'' Hurwitz said in his
midtown office, ``I look to establish long-term relationships with
artists whose talent is so big the world eventually is going to
come around. It would be very risky for me to work with Adam and
Audra if I was just going to work on one record. Fortunately, for
the price of a medium-size Broadway musical, I can work with them
both for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Fifteen years ago, I knew I wanted Nonesuch involved
in musical theater because I've always loved it. But I'm very
patient. I was waiting for someone's work that I loved.''
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Kimmel, 51, has carved out his own turf by
recording smaller musicals that are mostly produced Off Broadway.
These include ``Bed and Sofa,'' a show at the Vineyard Theater in
1996 by the minimalist Polly Pen, and this season's critically
lambasted ``After the Fair'' by Matthew Ward and Stephen Cole,
produced by the York Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I love something and believe it's going to have a life,
then I do it,'' Kimmel said. ``We've done the occasional Broadway
show, like the last revival of `The King and I.' They can run as
much as $250,000 to record. Off Broadway musicals cost us in the
early teens and up. They sell anywhere from 4,000 copies. Still,
most break even. And for the littlest musicals, having a record
really helps generate stock and amateur productions.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lippa, a young composer-lyricist whose musical ``The Wild
Party'' opens in February at the Manhattan Theater Club (one of two
competing productions of ``The Wild Party'' this season), was glad
to have his first produced show, ``Jon and Jen,'' preserved by
Kimmel in 1995. ``The recording stamped legitimacy on the whole
thing,'' Lippa said. ``It made me feel like a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I make any money from the record?'' he asked rhetorically.
``No. If not for Bruce, though, a lot of people wouldn't have
records. Bruce works very quickly and very cheaply, but he does
them. We did ours in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of the Seagram company,
is a musical-theater fan, it turns out. At Bronfman's direction,
all of the wholly owned labels of his Universal Music Group that
possess musical-theater catalogs have been merged into one
musical-theater division. This includes Decca, the first record
company to make an original cast album (``Oklahoma!'' in 1943).
Perhaps that is why the new entity at MCA has been named Decca
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bronfman's intention, said Chris Roberts, his president
for classics and jazz, who will oversee Decca Broadway, to pursue
new musical-theater recording projects. ``We're not just going to
sweep in and spend a lot of money,'' Roberts said. ``This isn't
about status. This is about love of an art form. It's about growing
young artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the four major new musicals announced for Broadway so far
this season _the Bee Gees' ``Saturday Night Fever,'' which begins
previews late next month; the musicalization of ``Jane Eyre'' by
the pop songwriter Paul Gordon, expected to open next year; the
Walt Disney Company's reworked ``Aida,'' with a score by Elton John
and Tim Rice, scheduled for April, and Stephen Sondheim and John
Weidman's ``Wise Guys,'' which, pending its workshop in November,
may open in the spring _ only ``Aida'' at this point has an
American record contract. It will be recorded by Walt Disney
Records, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Nonesuch, Varese Sarabande and RCA Victor are focused elsewhere
for now. Rosenfield said he would like to record ``Wise Guys'' and
both productions of ``The Wild Party,'' while Nonesuch awaits an
encore from Guettel. His ``Floyd Collins,'' with its much admired
score, was done Off Broadway in 1995. It has just ended a tour of
regional theaters and may return to New York, this time to
Broadway. Guettel, meanwhile, is working on his next piece, a
musical based on an Elizabeth Spencer novel, ``The Light in the
Piazza.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Michael John LaChiusa, whose 1994 ``Hello Again'' at
Lincoln Center was recorded by Rosenfield at RCA and whose songs
are among the pleasures of Ms. McDonald's CD, he is on the verge of
a possible breakthrough season. After nearly a decade of
apprenticeship as one of musical theater's more iconoclastic young
talents, LaChiusa expects to have back-to-back world premieres,
both on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine,'' the Creole retelling of ``Medea'' which he
wrote for Ms. McDonald, opens at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at
Lincoln Center in December. ( Rosenfield is recording it for RCA.)
That show will be followed by the season's second New York take on
``The Wild Party,'' this one with lyrics and music by LaChiusa and
a book by him and George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Joseph Papp
Public Theater. The $5 million production is going straight to
Broadway with a high-profile cast that may include Vanessa
Williams, Mandy Patinkin and Eartha Kitt.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much to suggest that LaChiusa's arrival on Broadway
this season, and possibly that of Guettel, could signal a new era
for musical theater's next generation?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. Broadway taste has rarely seemed more retrograde, as
the industry cozies up to retread movie soundtrack musicals like
the current ``Footloose'' and the forthcoming ``Saturday Night
Fever,'' while long-running British shows, like overstuffed dinner
guests, simply refuse to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the single most important reason new young composers
can't break through on Broadway,'' Rosenfield said. ``Too many dead
shows just taking up space.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to Wiley Hausam, an associate producer in charge of
musical-theater development at the Public, the future of the
American musical resides not on Broadway at all but rather in opera
houses. ``Opera companies embracing new musical-theater artists,''
Hausam said, ``that's where the next generation of great musicals
is going to come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet isn't there something disconcerting about this
quintessentially populist American invention disappearing into the
rarefied precincts of opera? The need to engage the widest possible
audience has always allowed musical theater a healthy lack of
pretension.
</P>
<P>
   One promising young composer who appears capable of straddling
these two worlds is Peter Foley. Born in Berkeley, Calif., he
attended Yale University determined to become a composer with an
emphasis on choral writing. But the state of Broadway musical
theater depressed him once he moved to New York in 1990.
Eventually, Foley sat down and wrote a science fiction musical he
called ``The Hidden Sky,'' best sung, he concedes, by a cast of 30
but quickly cut to the minimum he believes his music can sustain:
12 voices.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the influential Philadelphia institution formerly
known as the American Music Theater Festival (now renamed the
Prince Music Theater in honor of the director Harold Prince) will
present ``The Hidden Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley will be keeping company with an eclectic group. Also part
of the Prince season is an adaptation of ``The Snow Queen'' by the
classical composer Richard Peaslee and the poet Adrien Mitchell (in
December). Before that, ``Running Man'' by Diedre Murray and
Cornelius Eady, produced last season in New York at HERE by the
Music Theater Group, will be reprised in Philadelphia (Oct. 22-Nov.
7). The Music Theater Group hopes to reopen the show in New York,
where it received praise for both the production and Ms. Murray's
jazz-inflected score.
</P>
<P>
   For Foley, the future is clear. ``I want to write musicals that
make people glad they pushed themselves out of the house that night
and for some reason went to the theater,'' he said. ``I want to
write shows that make people's week.''
</P>
<P>
   No one from musical theater's younger generation has yet rivaled
the success of Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, who, with ``Once
on This Island'' in 1990 and with their Tony Award-winning score
for the current musical ``Ragtime'' (both recorded by Rosenfield
for RCA), truly have managed to make it on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But the bankruptcy proceedings engulfing Garth Drabinsky, the
former head of Livent and producer of ``Ragtime,'' have taken their
toll. ``It has been a really rough year,'' Ms. Ahrens acknowledged
recently. ``In terms of musical theater, I now know far more about
bankruptcy law than I ever hoped to.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Flaherty just concluded a four-week workshop for Livent
of their new musical, ``The Seussical,'' based on the books of Dr.
Seuss. It is the last vestige of Livent's involvement in the show.
In September, ``The Seussical'' will become the bankruptcy-sale
property of one of Broadway's biggest corporate players, the Pace
Theatrical Group, which itself is owned by the giant SFX
Entertainment Inc., a producer of live music, theater and sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's problems affected an artist on another show as well,
illustrating a fact of life on Broadway. As the corporate presence
increases and as resources for institutional theaters wane,
nonprofits can sometimes enter into bargains of inconvenience with
commercial producers while trying to create adventurous musical
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Lincoln Center Theater found itself stranded when
the $5 million musical ``Parade,'' produced in association with
Livent, received mixed reviews and Livent and Drabinsky became
embroiled in financial woes. As a result, according to Rosenfield
at RCA Victor, ``Parade'' nearly lost its informal agreement with
his company for a cast album.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Robert Brown, the young composer-lyricist of ``Parade,''
who won a Tony for his score and has a commission from Lincoln
Center Theater to write a new musical, said he is still upset by
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out,'' Brown
said. ``They announced they would not spend another dime on the
show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But
when Livent pulled out of `Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they
were pulling out, too. I had to go to Billy Rosenfield and ask him:
`What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' Billy
said, `Sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater,
emphasized: ``We were determined to make the album, even though,
God knows, we could ill afford to do it. We canvassed everyone for
money, including some of our board members.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown enlisted all those he could think of as well. ``In the
end,'' he said, ``RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big
chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's
$25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and
Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of
musical theater composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy
Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we
pulled it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sanford, the artistic director at Playwrights Horizons, is a
realist when it comes to other people's money. ``We would never be
able to do musicals if there weren't commercial producers
attached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This season his theater is mounting a musical play and a
full-fledged musical. The first, ``The Dead'' (opening in October),
is an adaptation by the playwright Richard Nelson of the James
Joyce story, with extensive incidental music by the Irish composer
Shaun Davey. The second, ``The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her
Chameleon Skin,'' is a new musical by a first-time
composer-lyricist-librettist, Kirsten Childs, a former actress and
Fosse dancer. It arrives in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get a job in the '70s in musical theater if you
were black,'' Ms. Childs said recently, ``unless you had your hand
on your hip and were wagging your head. It might be a hair better
now, but not much. I guess that's why I finally started to write a
musical myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead'' came to Playwrights Horizons via the Broadway
producers Gregory Mosher and Arielle Tepper, who had presented John
Leguizamo's ``Freak.'' They were seeking an Off Broadway partner
for their latest commercial venture after an earlier plan to rent
the Vivian Beaumont Theater fell through.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Bubbly Black Girl,'' about a young girl growing up in
Los Angeles in the 1960s and '70s, was a show that Playwrights
pursued. ``I was blown away when I first heard it last summer at
the Eugene O'Neill Theater Festival,'' said Ira Weitzman, the
associate producer for musical theater at Playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Others were interested, including the Manhattan Theater Club,
the Public Theater and the Vineyard Theater. Also interested was
Wind Dancer Productions, a company formed by Matt Williams, who
created ``Home Improvement'' and ``Roseanne'' and was the executive
producer of ``The Cosby Show.'' Not surprisingly, Wind Dancer won
the rights to ``The Bubbly Black Girl,'' with Playwrights Horizons
designated as the theater in which it would be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, ``The Bubbly Black Girl'' now has two producers:
one with a lot of money and experience in television, the other
with little money and a lot of experience in creating new musicals.
This would not have been the case as recently as the early 1990s.
Until then, according to Sanford, Playwrights Horizons
``consistently received charitable donations for musical-theater
development, not co-production deals.'' Decisions about everything
to do with a new musical, he said, right down to which record label
would record a show, were made by the theater alone, not jointly
with the donor. Over the last few years, though, that has changed.
And it is why when the time comes to decide who will record ``The
Bubbly Black Girl'' the final decision will be Wind Dancer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do wish,'' Sanford said, ``that the commercial theater
community and everybody with an interest in musical theater would
give Playwrights a subsidy for development of new musicals with no
strings attached. But they just don't do that anymore.''  &QL;

<P>
   GOSHEN, N.Y. _ While other teen-agers were enjoying the
dwindling vacation days of late summer, Mario Rangel was sitting in
front of a laptop computer, trying to memorize the capitals of
Europe for an online geography class.
</P>
<P>
   Mario's father is a migrant farm worker, one of many who travel
each year from southern Texas to Orange County, N.Y., areas rich in
black-dirt fields of onions, lettuce and other crops. For youths
like Mario and his siblings, the stay up north, about an hour and a
half from Manhattan, is an exciting time to renew summer
friendships cultivated over the years. But the migrant life can
take a heavy toll on their educations.
</P>
<P>
   Students like Mario almost inevitably lose time in the classroom
when they shuttle between states with different school calendars.
Those who leave Texas for New York in late May, for example, may
find it little use to sign up for the last few days or weeks of New
York's school year, especially since much of that time is given
over to test taking.
</P>
<P>
   And since curriculums and course schedules also vary widely
among states, migrant children who take classes out of state
frequently find themselves several steps behind their classmates
when they return home in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Mario, who dreams of becoming an electrical
engineer, is participating in a program that gives the teen-age
children of migrant farm workers laptop computers to use in taking
classes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get the class over with on line, I can do something
else in school instead of feeling like I have to catch up,'' said
Mario, who is studying world geography.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old project, known as Estrella (``star'' in
Spanish), is paid for with a $400,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Education. It seeks to use technology to alleviate a
pressing problem among a group of high school students whose
dropout rate is about 50 percent: lack of continuity in schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to get kids graduated,'' said Robert E. Lynch,
coordinator of the program in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the program seeks to give children
from poor homes a familiarity with computers that middle-class
children with personal computers in their bedrooms take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 50 teen-agers from Texas who migrate to New York,
Illinois and Montana are taking part. They and their families are
given lessons in how to use the equipment before they leave Texas.
They also sign a contract pledging to devote at least seven hours a
week to their classes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teen-agers in Montana and Illinois, and a smaller
number in New York, work in the fields during the day and carve out
time at night to do their studies, usually in school buildings with
the phone lines necessary for computer modems.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, meanwhile, many of the students do their lessons
from their homes _ often crowded, ramshackle housing that the
program equips with telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, most of the 35 students who participated
in the program's first year completed the classes, which are
offered in subjects ranging from algebra to world history,
according to Brenda R. Pessin, who oversees Estrella as part of her
job as director of migrant education services for the nonprofit
Illinois Migrant Council.
</P>
<P>
   For three failing middle-school students, she added, taking and
passing the online course meant they could advance to the next
grade when they returned to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If Mario, 15, successfully completes the course and its
follow-up tests, he receives credit at his school in Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The courses are offered through NovaNET, an online education
company that sells its services to school districts. Students are
given bite-size chunks of lessons, sometimes accompanied by video
clips, charts and other multimedia graphics. Lessons include
drills, quizzes and instructional games. Mario's geography course,
for example, included a crossword puzzle about rivers of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each unit of study generally ends in an online test that must be
passed before the student can go to the next unit.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella students decide what courses to take after consulting
with guidance counselors at their schools in Texas and, in some
cases, New York.
</P>
<P>
   While they are logged on, students are generally on their own _
there are usually no teachers to join them on line to answer
questions or discuss their work. But there is some oversight. From
her computer, Nancy Fernandez, a staff worker in a migrant
education outreach program for the mid-Hudson area, can determine
how much time students have devoted to their studies.
</P>
<P>
   She also meets in person with each student each week to chat,
discuss problems and act as a gentle prod if any of them begin to
slow down in their school work.
</P>
<P>
   Students can also turn to the project's Texas-based Web master,
who manages the project's technical aspects, for technical help.
</P>
<P>
   The service does not come cheaply. At close to $8,000 per
student, the program causes some educators to wonder whether the
money would not be better used to match students with
flesh-and-blood teachers. ``Maybe it's the best we can do, but I
think it's sad that we don't see the need for getting teachers more
closely involved with these kids,'' said Lowell W. Monke, an
assistant professor of education at Grinnell College and the
co-author of a book, to be published next year, that examines
classroom Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Sloan, a professor at Columbia University's Teachers
College, said the program risked being a Band-Aid for a serious
social ill. ``It promises to solve a problem without addressing the
real nature of the problem involved _ an exploitative labor
system,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella's organizers respond that the program exists to give
the participants a means to escape migrant life. ``We are providing
the migrant youth with education and skills so they can make a
choice,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also say it would not be possible to hire all the
specialty teachers needed for the many subject areas taught in high
school. And, they say, they try to build human contact into the
program. For example, a ``cyber-mentor'' e-mail correspondence
program pairs the teen-agers with college students.
</P>
<P>
   To Gary Chapman, a social policy researcher at the University of
Texas who has criticized some computer-based education as little
more than technological glitz, Estrella makes sense. ``This is one
example where you get the thing that technology is good for _
shifting time and space _ where it might actually help,'' he said.

 &HT;    Resiliency keeps Braves playoffs in sight
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To fully appreciate the wonderful psyche of the
current Braves, we'll return to Sunday's game at Turner Field
against the Padres. The setting is the home dugout. It is the
bottom of the fifth inning, and Brian Jordan is doing the
equivalent of making the sun tumble from the sky by letting his
pain conquer his will.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in baseball is tougher than Jordan, but after two months
of a throbbing right hand, even the Braves' right fielder wrapped
inside a strong safety's body is threatening a Roberto Duran.
</P>
<P>
   No mas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in so much pain that I really wanted to pull myself out
of the game,'' said Jordan, recalling Tuesday night how he relayed
his thoughts to pitcher Greg Maddux, sitting nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that, after a few words from Maddux, Jordan stays
around long enough to knock in the winning run in the bottom of the
ninth inning. Jordan said, ``When I wanted to leave the game, Greg
looked at me and said, `Hey, you gotta be like a dog. You gotta be
aggressive. You gotta suck it up. You just have to forget about the
pain.' I said, `Wow. This is a pitcher motivating an everyday
player.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This also is why the Braves will survive their little war with
the Mets along the way to flashing a pulse for one of the few times
in October. You see, despite the Braves' mighty forefathers through
the 1990s, producing four pennants and a World Championship, never
have they fielded a team with more guts, more courage, more
something.
</P>
<P>
   For our discussion, you can forget that bunch in '91, when the
Tomahawk Chop was as fresh as the guys on the roster. They were the
current Reds, just glad to have a worthy August and September.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Braves slipped by the Giants with 104
victories to their 103. That was another test of the Braves nerves,
all right. But those '93 Braves trailed the Giants by as much as 9
and 1/2 games in early August. Anything the Braves did afterward
was dandy, and it wasn't as if they were without their clean-up
hitter. They also had their closer, and one of their primary clutch
hitters did leave the roster for the rest of the season after
damaging his knee in July.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the plight of the current Braves, and we didn't even
mention that their starter in this one against the Reds was John
Smoltz, still battling elbow and thigh problems. As a result, he
did the unusual earlier this month by altering his pitching motion
to ease his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, with the healthy Mets nipping at their cleats,
the Braves continued to do well enough to enter Tuesday night's
action with the best record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it goes back to spring training, after we lost
Andres Galarraga (the cleanup hitter) and Kerry Ligtenberg (the
closer),'' said Glenn Hubbard, the Braves' first base coach, who
played second base for the team during the 1980s. ``(Braves
manager) Bobby (Cox) said, `Hey guys we've got the talent to win
it, and we ain't going to cry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: This scrappy bunch that threatens to keep clawing its
way toward better things. Jordan said, ``We're sucking it up. We're
gutting it out. So, to me, that just makes you better come playoff
time, because you've been through so much all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitely.

A MOZART RECITATIVE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By TAMARA BERNSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few pinholes in an old musical score _ and a Canadian
musicologist's passion for the chaotic world of 18th-century opera
_ have led to the discovery of what appears to be a long lost
recitative by Mozart. Dorothea Link, a specialist in the operas of
Mozart and his contemporaries, came across the setting for strings
and voice, 35 bars long, in the Austrian National Library in Vienna
a few months ago. The recitative precedes the well-known aria
``Vado, ma dove?'' (K. 583), which Mozart wrote for the singer
Luisa Villeneuve. Although the recitative is not in Mozart's hand,
all the evidence points to his authorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge discovery, but it's a nice one,'' said the
English musicologist Stanley Sadie, an eminent Mozart scholar and
the editor of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. ``It
helps fill in a bit of a picture. For generations, people thought
they knew everything Mozart had written. But lately a few things
have come to light.''
</P>
<P>
   Those few things include ``Der Stein der Weisen'' (``The
Philosopher's Stone''), a collectively composed Viennese opera to
which Mozart seems to have contributed several numbers. It was the
return of German music archives seized by the Soviets during World
War II that enabled David J. Buch, an Iowa musicologist, to
discover Mozart's apparent involvement in ``Der Stein'' in 1996.
But the recitative to ``Vado, ma dove?'' has been staring
musicologists in the face all along.
</P>
<P>
   The authenticity of Mozart's setting of ``Vado, ma dove?'' has
always been rock-solid, Ms. Link said recently from Halifax, Nova
Scotia, where she was wrapping up a year of teaching at Dalhousie
University. The autograph copy is in a library in Berlin; Mozart
also entered the piece in his handwritten catalog of his works. We
know that Mozart wrote the aria in 1789, at Villeneuve's request,
to replace one of her arias in ``Il Burbero di Buon Cuore'' (``The
Surly Benefactor''), an opera by Vicente Martin y Soler, who was
the most popular Viennese opera composer of Mozart's day.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute arias, as they are called, made news last fall, when
the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, appearing in ``Le Nozze de
Figaro'' at the Metropolitan Opera, overrode the wishes of the
director Jonathan Miller and sang two alternative arias Mozart had
written for Adriana Ferrarese del Bene, the second soprano to sing
the role of Susanna, also in 1789. A furor resulted, and the
superstar mezzo was taken to task in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 18th century, it was standard practice to ``bring
your own aria,'' so to speak, the idea being that singers were
entitled to music that suited their voices and acting
personalities. Ms. Link, whose current scholarly focus is the
original singers of Mozart's operas, noted that Villeneuve _ the
first Dorabella in ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' in 1790 _ seems to have been
particularly fond of Mozart's work; she asked him to provide
several substitute arias in the months preceding the premiere of
``Cosi Fan Tutte.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Ms. Link added, Villeneuve had good reason to want to
upgrade her arias for the 1789 revival of ``Il Burbero.'' ``The
singer who created her role clearly wasn't as good or famous as
Villeneuve, and Martin wrote the part accordingly,'' Ms. Link said.
``It was dime-store music.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most 18th-century arias, ``Vado, ma dove?'' was preceded by
a recitative: a short text set not with a lyrical melody but with
speechlike ``patter,'' harmonized with a few chords.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's autograph of ``Vado, ma dove?'' contains no recitative,
so it was generally assumed that when Villeneuve performed in ``Il
Burbero,'' she simply sang Martin's recitative _ a ``secco''
setting, for voice and continuo _ before lighting into Mozart's
aria. Singers today perform Mozart's ``Vado, ma dove?'' without
recitative. But when Ms. Link examined the score to ``Il Burbero''
used by the conductor of the Vienna Court Theater for all the
performances of the opera, she found a different story.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the score contains both Martin's and Mozart's
settings of ``Vado, ma dove?'' Mozart's aria, written out by a
court copyist, has been sewn into the original score. The pages
containing Martin's setting of the aria, meanwhile, show tiny
pinholes; these, Ms. Link explained, indicate that at one time
those pages were sewn shut, the 18th-century way of crossing out
unused material in a performing score.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But those pinholes show that Martin's secco recitative was also
sewn shut; it was replaced by a more elaborate setting, an
``accompanied'' recitative, for strings and voice. And the new
recitative was added at the same time as Mozart's aria.
</P>
<P>
   How can Ms. Link tell this? The accompanied recitative, she
explained, is written on the same type of paper as Mozart's ``Vado,
ma dove?'' and in the same hand. Recitative and aria were sewn into
the score in a single bundle. Most telling, perhaps, Mozart's aria
starts on the flip side of the last page of the accompanied
recitative.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Link proposes this scenario: Mozart finished the aria,
entered it into his catalog and delivered it to Villeneuve for a
run-through. But when they tried out the piece, they decided that
the immediately preceding passage of text now called for something
more elaborate than Martin's secco setting. So Mozart composed a
new accompanied recitative that captures the text's emotional
instability and rising tension.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied, he then submitted the two pieces, recitative and
aria, to the theater copyist, who wrote them out and inserted them
into the score together. The fact that Mozart did not include the
recitative in his catalog is not damning; he left out a number of
other small works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence that it's fully by Mozart really is
strong,'' said Sadie, who had seen a copy of the accompanied
recitative and read a paper Ms. Link had written about her
discovery, as yet unpublished. ``I don't think there's any reason
to question it.'' Sadie, speaking from his home in London, added
that the physical evidence _ pinholes, paper, binding, handwriting
_ is backed up by musical content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a number of his musical fingerprints on it,'' he
said: notably, a distinctive, downward arpeggio in the violins that
crops up frequently in ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' and ``a way of
building excitement'' through carefully gauged harmonic
progressions.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of 18th-century theatrical practice, Sadie said, it
is highly improbable that someone else would have written a new
recitative for Mozart's aria. Obviously, you cannot be 100 percent
certain without an autograph, he added. ``But if you were a betting
person, you could put 95 percent odds'' on Mozart's authorship.
</P>
<P>
   If those odds satisfy singers and conductors, the recitative
will add weight and dramatic tension to future performances of
``Vado, ma dove?,'' which is now heard chiefly in concert. (Plans
for a first performance and recording of the aria with its ``new''
recitative are underway at Lawrence University, in Appleton, Wis.,
where Ms. Link has just joined the music faculty.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Link's recitative and a handful of similar finds in
recent years have broader significance. They show that 18th-century
opera was, in her words, ``always a confluence of artistic
imagination and circumstances.'' It is no longer sufficient to take
an autograph score as the composer's last word; musicologists and
performers will have to pay more attention to conductors' scores,
with their record of what actually happened on stage. ``The
veneration of autographs has gone too far,'' Ms. Link said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``Vado, ma dove?'' likewise gives a revealing
glimpse of Mozart as, in Sadie's words, ``a practical man of the
theater.'' It helps dislodge the popular image of the composer as a
divine, mad genius, a cliche hard-wired into the modern imagination
by Peter Shaffer's play ``Amadeus'' and the film based on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in Mozart's day was writing for posterity,'' Sadie
said. ``They were writing to make sure that next week's
performances went well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Link picked up the theme: ``Nowadays we think that singers
have to give in to the score, that come hell or high water, they
have to `sing those notes.' But in the 18th century, it was the
composers who had to bend. It was a part of their pride in their
craft to say, `I don't care how bad that tenor is, I'll write
something that works.'''
</P>
<P>
   That, Ms. Link pointed out, is exactly what happened to Mozart
with ``Don Giovanni'': he had a good tenor for the original
production in Prague and a lousy one for the subsequent one in
Vienna. So in Vienna, he replaced the challenging tenor aria ``Il
mio tesoro'' with a new, simpler one, ``Dalla sua pace.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the Vienna Elvira was a soprano of greater
stature than the Prague one, so Mozart added a new aria for her,
``Mi tradi,'' which no one today would dream of leaving out. If,
right from the start, Mozart was writing for specific singers, with
all their strengths and weaknesses, who is to say what his
``ideal'' version was? What today's public thinks of as the
``correct'' version of ``Don Giovanni,'' Ms. Link noted, is in fact
a composite of the Prague and Vienna productions. ``Yet we won't
tolerate a hodgepodge version of the two productions of `Figaro.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the Bartoli affair. ``She was perfectly
right,'' Ms. Link said of Ms. Bartoli's decision to sing Mozart's
alternative arias for Susanna. ``Her voice is much more like
Ferrarese's than Sto-race's'' _ Nancy Storace having been the
original Susanna. Ms. Link speaks of those historic singers as if
they were old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period-instrument movement is authentic in so many ways,''
she added. ``Now it's time to expand that to the actual material
being sung, to reflect the operatic practices of the time. Today's
audiences expect to hear ornamentation added to arias. Why not add
the element of surprise of which arias are actually going to be
sung? The notion of what is authentic is a whole lot wider than
what we've heretofore thought.''

 &HT;    Streak's 6 as Smoltz ends slide
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz was mired in the longest winless streak of
his career, and now this?
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th start of that stretch, which by Tuesday night was
more than two months old, Smoltz had Reds ace Pete Harnisch and his
eight-game winning streak to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Maybe that was the best way for Smoltz to put an end
to his frustrations, with a 6-4 victory that extended the Braves'
winning streak to six games, matching their longest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves used a pair of lively innings to rough up Harnisch
for six runs, the most he'd allowed all season. That helped Smoltz
overcome a three-run home run that shouldn't have happened and earn
his first win since June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Since that win over the Diamondbacks in the desert, Smoltz has
gone on and come off the disabled list with an inflamed elbow. He
strained his groin and didn't miss a start. He has lowered his arm
angle to three-quarters and added a different change-up to his
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched well in Pittsburgh and lost, pitched well against the
Astros and took no-decision, and defied science in Denver by
holding the Rockies to two runs in six innings before taking yet
another a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   All that brought him to Tuesday as the one the Braves turned to
continue their roll against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves spotted Smoltz a 2-0 lead in the first inning after
jumping on Harnisch for five hits, then erased a 3-2 deficit with
another four runs in the sixth. The first five Braves hitters of
that inning reached base on three singles, a walk and a two-run
double by Jose Hernandez for a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams had sent Harnisch's first pitch of the game past
Aaron Boone at third base for a double and eventually scored on a
Chipper Jones flare over Boone's head into shallow left field. But
the rally ended prematurely when Ryan Klesko was thrown out at
home, and Aaron Boone has some offensive revenge in store.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had a chance at an inning-ending double play in the
second on a grounder by catcher Eddie Taubensee but came up
empty-gloved as the ball stuck in the infield dirt. That allowed
Aaron Boone a trip to the plate, and he worked the count to 3-1
before depositing a Smoltz fastball into the left field seats to
give the Reds a 3-2 lead.

RENO AND BRITISH STEP UP MONEY LAUNDERING INQUIRY AT BANK OF NEW
YORK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 17th graf, `In October 1998 ...' to add that it's unclear why
account was kept open past March.)  (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal money laundering investigation at the Bank of New
York is intensifying this week as Attorney General Janet Reno and
British authorities stepped up their interest in the effort,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House Banking Committee said it planned to hold
hearings next month on international financial corruption and the
threat to America's banking system from money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue is whether foreign theft has been facilitated by
self-serving banking practices in the Western world, including the
U.S.,'' said Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the banking
committee. ``With regard to the Bank of New York, the question is
whether they were unwittingly duped or were willing facilitators.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question has huge implications for the bank.
But it will take some time for that to be known, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, if a bank is found to have knowingly
laundered money for criminals, federal regulators can revoke its
charter effectively putting it out of business. Even if just one
employee acted without the knowledge of bank management, the
institution could still face severe penalities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the investigation at the bank was publicly acknowledged
last week, the bank has been cooperating with a federal
investigation of its Eastern European accounts since last
September, according to people involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, regulators are questioning whether the bank ever
properly supervised one of its fastest-growing businesses. Billions
of dollars, some of it investigators believe tied to Russian
organized crime, flowed through the bank, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bank conducted transactions with money that came from
criminal activity and it did so knowingly or through willful
blindness, it can be prosecuted for money laundering whether or not
it filed suspicious activity reports,'' said Charles Intriago, a
money laundering expert and publisher of Money Laundering Alert, a
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bank nor any of its employees have been accused of
any wrongdoing. Two senior bank employees were suspended last week
pending the outcome of the investigation. The bank will not discuss
any aspect of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the bank was compromised by employees
secretly undertaking crimes. But even if that were the case, the
bank could still be in serious legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rule that says that more than one employee needs to
know for a bank to be convicted'' of illegal activity, said
Intriago. ``If the employee acted within the scope of his or her
duties then the institution can be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``An account of this magnitude _ given the area in which the
bank was dealing _ should have had supervisory reviews up and down
the line,'' Intriago said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is said by a person close to her to have a ``personal
interest'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the last few days, two British investigators
arrived in the United States to bolster the FBI's effort, and
Switzerland's banking commission said Tuesday that it is also
cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss law enforcement authorities said earlier this year that
Russian organized crime had been actively laundering money in banks
there and Swiss prosecutors have been investigating allegations of
money laundering involving members of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals close to the Bank of New York investigation said the
bank began cooperating with the probe at a relatively early stage,
suggesting that much of the most suspect activity occurred only
because the bank left accounts open to observe and entrap those
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, huge sums began zipping through accounts at the
bank, activity that would total $4.2 billion by March of this year.
This was one month after the bank began cooperating with
investigators, officials involved in the investigation say. But it
was unclear why the account was allowed to remain open beyond
March.
</P>
<P>
   Money-laundering is a legal catch-phrase referring to the
criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them
through a sequence of bank accounts so that they ultimately look
like legitimate profits from legal businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key accounts through which money is suspected of
being laundered belongs to a company called Benex, which
investigators believe filtered money for Semyon Mogilevich, an
alleged kingpin of Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Benex's owner, Peter Berlin, is married to Lucy Edwards, a Bank
of New York executive in London. Ms. Edwards reported to Natasha
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, who ran the bank's Russian business from its
New York headquarters. Ms. Edwards and Ms. Kagalovsky are the two
Bank of New York employees who have been suspended. Both women have
declined to comment; Berlin cannot be located.
</P>
<P>
   Benex went into business in London in May, 1998, according to
British corporate records. A month later, in June, 1998, British
authorities, investigating the financial activities of Russian
organized crime, alerted the FBI to suspected money laundering at
the Bank of New York involving Benex. This was the first time the
FBI became aware of the problem, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Republic National Bank of New York, which
actively competed with the Bank of New York for Russian business,
sent a letter to the FBI regarding suspicious money transfers its
handled involving Russian companies and the Bank of New York .
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, the FBI notified the Bank of New York of an
investigation and it was only at this time that the bank filed its
own suspicious activities report with regulators.

COURT CLEARS CLINTON AIDE IN LYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals panel Tuesday cleared Ira
Magaziner, the chief architect of the Clinton administration's
ill-fated health plan, of lying under oath to a federal court about
the nature of the White House task force that helped formulate the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a federal trial judge, Royce Lamberth, criticized
Magaziner, saying that he, with the Justice Department and the
White House, behaved ``reprehensibly'' and ``dishonestly'' in
describing the makeup of the task force. Lamberth said Magaziner
and the government tried to defend the fact that the task force
deliberated in secret by falsely claiming that all of its members
were full-time federal employees when dozens, if not hundreds, of
part-time consultants were members.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth fined the government more than $285,000 to pay the
legal costs of some of the outside medical and consumer groups that
had filed suit to require that the task force's deliberations be
public.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit strongly disagreed Tuesday with
Lamberth's finding. In a unanimous decision, the panel said there
was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the government or
Magaziner.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court held that the district court's findings of bad
faith ``are without clear and convincing evidentiary support and
that the attorney's fees award therefore cannot be upheld insofar
as it rests on bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner, a longtime friend of President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, was hurt by the charge, his friends said, and tried
to clear his name. He did not return telephone calls seeking
comment Tuesday, but his lawyer, Irvin Nathan, said, ``We are
grateful that the Court of Appeals has unanimously vindicated Mr.
Magaziner and upheld all of the arguments we made in this appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the composition of the task force headed by
Mrs. Clinton and set up in 1993, just days after Clinton took
office. In a sworn declaration, Magaziner seemed to say that all of
the members of the task force were government employees. Under a
1972 federal law, such a task force may keep its meetings private
if all members are government employees but may not do so if its
membership includes non-government people.
</P>
<P>
   The task force had, in fact, recruited scores of experts from
private industry to advise the Clinton administration on how to
reshape the nation's health care system to control costs and
provide health insurance for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth was at first so angered by what he called the
government's deceptive description of the task force that he asked
federal prosecutors to see if any criminal laws had been violated.
The U.S. attorney's office concluded in 1995 that there was no
evidence that Magaziner or the government had intended to to
mislead the court.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lamberth then ruled that Magaziner and the
government had acted in contempt of the court and imposed the fine,
accusing them of trying to ``cover up'' their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After the health care plan was soundly rejected in Congress,
Magaziner went to work on Internet issues at the White House. He
has since left government service.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court sent the case back to Lamberth for
reconsideration.

 &HT;    Dell shows its guests a hot time
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Rob Edinger's boss at Warner-Lambert Co.
decided to send him to Austin for Dell Computer Corp.'s
DirectConnect trade show, the computer technician pictured a
respite from New Jersey's stiflingly hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch that.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the mid-80s Tuesday in Morris Plains, N.J., where the
huge pharmaceuticals concern is based. At one point Tuesday
afternoon, the electronic billboard welcoming attendees to
DirectConnect registered 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   No sweat, Edinger said Tuesday from inside the Austin Convention
Center, where he was one of the first of about 1,400 customers to
arrive at the invitation-only event being held through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He still gets to hear Microsoft Corp. Chairman and Chief
Executive Bill Gates speak today and Intel Corp. Chief Executive
Craig Barrett speak Thursday on the future of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know what they're (thinking) and how they're
going to implement it,'' said the 28-year-old Edinger, whose job
includes updating the software in 3,000 or so computers that
Warner-Lambert employees use in Morris Plains.
</P>
<P>
   That's why most of the DirectConnect attendees from around the
world _ ranging from computer technicians like Edinger to
executives at companies in various industries _ converged on Austin
Tuesday: To get a glimpse of the future of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Gates, speakers at DirectConnect include host and
Dell CEO Michael Dell and Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive John
Chambers. Dell partners such as IBM Corp., Novel Corp., Sony Corp
and Tivoli Systems Inc. will show their latest products in the
exhibit hall.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the gathering is Dell's effort to show the world that it
is working with other industry giants to help customers do business
in an era when e-commerce is expected to reach $1 trillion. With
Microsoft, for instance, Dell will show its customers how they can
upgrade from Windows NT to Windows 2000, when Microsoft's highly
anticipated operating system comes out next year.
</P>
<P>
   But some news also is expected: Dell officials are scheduled to
announce today a new initiative in Internet services _ an area that
the company sees as ripe for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Details on Windows 2000 and new Dell initiatives are the sort of
information that Edinger and others can take home with them as
their companies decide whose computers will position them to thrive
in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   But while Dell's two most recent quarters have been the best in
the industry, it will be a tough sale with some customers.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials Inc., which recently decided IBM will provide
its desktop computers, has about 50 servers made by Compaq Computer
Corp. at its manufacturing plant in Austin, said Mike LaMarre, a
network manager who is attending DirectConnect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NT space, Compaq is still the best,'' said LaMarre, who
has a lot to say about how Applied spends $1 million annually on
servers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is concerned about Compaq's recent executive turnover
and signs that it is losing market share to Dell and others. But
LaMarre claims no other computer company can match Compaq's system
of detecting problems early, which allows Applied to avoid bigger
problems.
</P>
<P>
   For Edinger, LaMarre and scores of other Dell guests, Gates is
the highlight of the two-day gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the richest men in the world,'' LaMarre said.
``He's made a giant (company) and I use his products every day.''

PROFESSIONALS, AMATEURS AND A HOBBYIST HAVE A BUSY NIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ The busiest night yet of this world track and
field championship was one for professionals, like Hicham
el-Guerrouj and Haile Gebrselassie, who both underscored their
dominance by winning gold medals. It was one for amateurs, like the
meet officials who mistakenly told the American pole vaulter Jeff
Hartwig he had qualified. It was even one for a hobbyist like
Anthony Washington, a part-time discus thrower who became the first
American to win his technical event at a major championship since
Mac Wilkins in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, this is a hobby; I work for a living,'' Washington
said, after his final throw of 226 feet 8 inches had lifted him
from fourth to first and past two Germans, Jurgen Schult and the
four-time world champion Lars Riedel, for whom the discus is a
full-time and very good living.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, a 33-year-old graduate of Syracuse who is married
and has two young sons, has worked for US West as a market analyst
in Denver since November. Though he finished fourth at the last
Summer Olympics in Atlanta, he has flirted with retirement with
varying degrees of sincerity since 1994, a year in which he said he
competed in only one event.
</P>
<P>
   But like his former high-school rival in New York state, C.J.
Hunter, who won the shot put with a lengthy and timely final effort
on Saturday, Washington found a way to rise above his past
frustrations in major championships in the sultry evening air of
Seville.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw C.J. hit that big throw on his last attempt, it was
fantastic, and I said, `If C.J. can get one, maybe it's possible
for me,''' Washington said. ``He's been doing it a long time, just
like me, but I didn't want to have to win it on the last throw.
That takes years off your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The track and field news Tuesday night was not only about good
lines and good performances, however. The International Amateur
Athletic Federation also announced that two athletes _ the sprinter
Davidson Ezinwa of Nigeria and the middle-distance runner Mohamed
Ibrahim Aden of Somalia _ tested positive for banned substances in
drug tests administered here.
</P>
<P>
   Ezinwa, who reached the 100-meter final at the 1992 and 1996
Olympics, tested positive for Hcg, a substance that can help
produce testosterone in men, and has been suspended and could face
a two-year ban. He failed to reach the 100 final. Aden's urine
sample showed traces of ephedrine. He finished sixth in the first
semifinal of the 1,500 and has been disqualified and was issued a
public warning.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Aden had reached the final on Tuesday night, he
certainly would not have troubled el-Guerrouj, the world-record
holder and defending world champion in the 1,500. An acute case of
hemorrhoids kept him out of action for a month after he set the
world mark in the mile on July 7 in Rome with Noah Ngeny of Kenya
on his heels, but since his return, the Moroccan has now beaten
Ngeny, his main competition, twice more at 1,500: in Zurich and on
Tuesday night in a time of 3 minutes 27.65 seconds, which was a
championship record and, remarkably for a meet of this sort, the
fifth-fastest time in history. In the final 20 meters, el-Guerrouj
pinched his fingers together and brought them to his lips, blowing
kisses into the air.
</P>
<P>
   El-Guerrouj's most pressing goals now are to hold the world
record at every distance from 1500 to 5,000 and to win his first
Olympic gold medal next year in Sydney, Australia. But
Gebrselassie, the small and preternaturally smooth Ethiopian,
already has won every distance title that matters, and Tuesday
night he won his fourth consecutive world title in the 10,000 in a
time of 27:57.27. It was a closer race than most that the Ethiopian
runs: Paul Tergat of Kenya was second in 27:58.56; his fellow
Ethiopian Assefa Mezgebu third in 27:59.15.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no attempt to double in the 5,000.
Gebrselassie finds the conditions in Seville too hot. Even at 9:30
p.m., when his race began, it was 88 degrees with considerable
humidity in the stadium. He also wants to conserve his energy to
try to break his own world record in the 5,000 next month.
</P>
<P>
   The American 100-meter champions Maurice Greene and Marion Jones
both qualified for the semifinals of the 200 by getting through two
rounds on Tuesday, but two of their teammates, Allen Johnson and
Hartwig, had a day to forget in the heat. Johnson, the reigning
Olympic champion and two-time defending world champion in the
110-meter hurdles, withdrew before the semifinals after reinjuring
the right calf that had kept him out of action since July 8.
Hartwig, one of the favorites for a medal in the men's pole vault,
failed to advance out of qualifying, although he had a good excuse.
</P>
<P>
   After clearing 18 feet 2 inches on his first attempt, short of
the automatic qualifying standard but potentially good enough to
earn a spot in the final anyway, he waited to see if he needed to
jump again. Hartwig said one official finally told him that he had
qualified. ``He showed me the board and said, `It's finished,'''
Hartwig said. ``So I went over and sat down, and the next thing you
know my name is up and the clock is running. They come and they
point to me and say you're up.''
</P>
<P>
   He rushed out to try to clear 18-8\ and said he got a bad grip
on his pole, which slipped and bruised his right thigh, foot and
knee. He ended up missing three times and missing the final by one
spot.

 &HT;    Elder-Beerman reports loss
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. reported Tuesday a
second-quarter loss of $1.3 million, but its chief executive said
the company can turn itself around in time for the crucial
Christmas sales season.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments since a major investor publicly
asked for his resignation, Elder-Beerman Chairman and Chief
Executive Frederick J. Mershad said he has no plans to resign and
that changes in company management announced Monday will work.
</P>
<P>
   Mershad also renewed his vow to keep Elder-Beerman independent
even though the company's largest shareholder told Barron's , a
national business weekly, the company would be a ``tremendous
acquisition or merger for somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Mershad said he has full confidence that Charles Shaffer, the
company's new chief merchant, can quickly resolve lingering
merchandise problems that have contributed to recent losses.
Shaffer inherits merchandising duties from Mershad, who handled
them since 1997, when he joined the company. Mershad said Tuesday
he relinquished those duties in part because they spread him too
thin.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer, an executive for the Moraine-based retailer for 14
years, has final say over what items go into the chain's 60 stores,
Mershad said, and will oversee the company's marketing operation.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the earnings loss, management has forecasted more
conservatively for the fall selling season. The company also plans
to cut $3.5 million in expenses, Mershad said.
</P>
<P>
   The change comes as the retailer enters the last six months of
its fiscal year, which generates about 90 percent of its sales.
</P>
<P>
   Elder-Beerman, as predicted, reported Tuesday a second-quarter
net loss of $1.3 million, compared with net income of $0.2 million
during the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share equaled a loss of 8 cents per share, compared
with net income of 2 cents per share during the same period last
year. Sales climbed 11.9 percent to $147.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stein, a retail analyst with Cleveland-based McDonald and
Co. Securities, said the numbers came in as expected. Elder-Beerman
warned investors Aug. 5 that it would suffer a second-quarter loss
exceeding $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly results came a day after Elder-Beerman announced plans
to bolster its stock's value through such steps as a share
repurchase of up to $24 million over two years, making more
acquisitions and reorganizing merchandising operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the things we've done prepare us for future
growth,'' Mershad said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the top executive for Elder-Beerman's largest
shareholder, Snyder Capital Management Inc. of San Francisco, told
Barron's Elder-Beerman is a tremendous acquisition or merger
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder Capital Management founder and president Alan B. Snyder
told the publication he plans to meet with dissident shareholder
David Nierenberg of D3 Family Fund L.P.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg notified the federal government more than a week ago
his group of 80 investors has acquired 845,000 common shares, or
5.3 percent of Elder-Beerman's 16 million shares outstanding. He
has complained about the company's low share price and has called
for the board to either fire Mershad and president John ``Jay''
Muskovich or to sell the company.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Murtaugh, a portfolio manager with Snyder Capital
Management, said the company would offer higher earnings potential
if it could turn itself around rather than be acquired by another
company.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder Capital Management is more supportive of Elder-Beerman's
executive team than Nierenberg, Murtaugh said. Officials from the
California money management firm have talked with Nierenberg, but
``we haven't decided how we're going to approach this. We want to
see what management says before we make any decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein lauded Elder-Beerman's initiatives to strengthen itself
and improve its share value. Buying back shares, reorganizing the
merchandising and bolstering the private-label credit card segment
should spur small sales gains for the company during this year's
second half, he said. But the real gains should come next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elder-Beerman (NASDAQ:EBSC) shares finished trading Tuesday at
7, down .

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton made a televised address to
the nation about Kosovo last March 24, he uttered a sentence for
which he was belabored that day and every day for the next 10
weeks, until he finally declared victory on June 10: ``I do not
intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, with the outcome of the bombing campaign still in
serious doubt, the president sharply altered course with the
comment: ``I don't think we or our allies should take any options
off the table, and that has been my position from the beginning,''
which of course it had not.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
known as Sandy, who wrote the initial offending sentence. Both he
and his boss saw fairly quickly that it was a mistake, because they
realized that having plunged into the conflict with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, there was no acceptable alternative
to a NATO victory. If ground troops were needed to get the Serbian
tanks out of Kosovo, then ground troops it would have to be.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may well have held out longer than he otherwise would
have because he believed that he faced no danger of land combat,
and he certainly gained time to savage ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
and drive them out. Berger told a friend as early as April that he
should have put in something about leaving all options on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   He did not do so, Berger said a few days after the bombing had
stopped, because ``the American people would not have supported the
war without European participation, and we never could have gotten
all 19 allies on board at the outset if they thought we had any
plan to use ground forces.'' In keeping with that view, Clinton cut
his rhetorical cloth to fit the politics of both NATO and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of criticism crossed party and ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, accused
the administration of indulging in ``a new technological racism''
based on the premise that the life of ``one American serviceman was
not worth risking in order to save the lives of thousands of
Kosovars.'' The Economist headlined an editorial, ``A Bungled
War.'' Michael Kelly, a columnist, suggested that a ham and cheese
sandwich could run foreign policy better than Berger and his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's place at the nexus of Kosovo strategy was no surprise,
nor was his concentration on its political aspects. Widely regarded
as the president's closest foreign policy aide, perhaps the most
influential national security adviser since Henry Kissinger, he is
at bottom a political rather than strategic figure. Unlike the
professors, diplomats and military officers who have for the most
part preceded him in his job, he made his way to the White House by
way of the salons and back rooms of Democratic politics while
pursuing a public career as a trade lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the lawyer's inherent caution,'' said John Dyson, a New
York investor and political operative who has known Berger since
college. ``The craft is a tactical craft. You focus on the
downside, always worrying about avoiding negative results.''
</P>
<P>
   Beefy and chubby-cheeked at 53, serious and formal in dark suits
and white shirts, Berger makes a sharp contrast to his elfin
predecessor, Anthony Lake, whom he served as a deputy during
Clinton's first term. Lake wore professorial tweeds. He was so
seldom seen in public that friends called him ``the submarine.''
But Berger's is a familiar face on television and on Capitol Hill,
where he has built strong links to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Style: A 15-Hour Day And a Modest Ego
</P>
<P>
   In the first term, Lake and the other main foreign-policy
figures were older than Clinton. Now they are contemporaries.
Berger, who has known Clinton since the McGovern presidential
campaign of 1972, helped him in small but important ways at low
points in his career. He has a closer relationship to the president
than Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is better at
formulating policies than in selling them to Clinton, or Defense
Secretary William Cohen, a Republican who spent the first Clinton
term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to find anyone who knows him who does not like
Berger personally. His ego is of normal dimensions. He buys his
reading glasses at the drug store. In a city where backbiting is
the preferred contact sport, he is widely considered a gentleman.
In a culture of 12-hour-days, he regularly puts in Stakhanovite
stints of 15 and 16 hours, fueled by endless glasses of iced
coffee, which he took to drinking when he gave up smoking.
Colleagues worry that he might fall victim to the same tensions as
Leon Fuerth, Vice President Al Gore's foreign-policy counselor, who
suffered a heart attack this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger gets very mixed reviews as a security adviser from
those outside his immediate circle. A European ambassador said he
lacked ``the indispensable ability to see around corners, to
anticipate events and to see how one problem relates to another.''
A friend and sometime administration colleague said Berger lacked
strategic vision but ``wants to be accepted as a kind of Sandy
Kissinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger himself commented rather condescendingly, ``you can't
expect a trade lawyer to be a global strategist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, Clinton's former political guru, wrote recently
that ``there are hundreds of members of the Council on Foreign
Relations who know more about foreign policy than Berger,'' but he
added that Berger was ``just right'' for the president's concept of
foreign policy which, he said, centers on domestic political and
economic considerations, not on strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense Berger's friends note that while Clinton's
attention to events abroad is normally intermittent, the president
was especially distracted for almost two years by the Lewinsky
matter. One retired American diplomat blamed ``a disastrous Balkan
policy, in which every aspect has been treated incrementally,''
mostly on the president.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Berger has to deal with a world seismically remade by
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a new framework for American foreign policy,''
said Harry McPherson, a Texan who worked in the Johnson White House
and has closely watched all administrations that followed. ``Well,
great. But who has produced one? Sandy's a carpenter, not an
architect, like everyone else these days. He's a good one, and that
may be the best we can hope for now.''
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out in Kosovo, Milosevic buckled under the
pressure of bombardment. But it was ``an exceptionally close-run
thing,'' a senior administration official said, with talks about
peace terms taking place at the same time as discussions about
sending in the troops if no agreement was reached by the end of
June. And the allies were unable, in the end, to prevent the
slaughter of many of the Kosovo Albanians they had acted to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said ``the president truly believed, as I believed and no
more than three other people in America did, that air power would
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is not yet clear that the war has been won. It is not
clear how many ethnic Albanians will ultimately be able to rebuild
their lives, or how successful the NATO alliance will be at
achieving the multiethnic society it says it wants for Kosovo.
There is little prospect of stabilizing the Balkans, an important
goal of American policy, without a stable Serbia. Yet that country
is in ruins, Milosevic remains in office and Clinton has vowed to
give only minimal rebuilding aid as long as he clings to power.
</P>
<P>
   The Bio: Small-Town Kid, Solid Democrat
</P>
<P>
   Berger grew up in Millerton, N.Y., a then-isolated rural
community of 900 people in the dairy country northeast of
Poughkeepsie. His father died when he was only 8, and his mother
ran a struggling Army-Navy surplus store. From his mother, he
inherited the habit of hard work and a love of order; he still
makes lists each Sunday, in his immaculate handwriting, of things
to be done the following week.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers stood apart from the Millerton mainstream, as
Democrats in a town where ``people gave parties when F.D.R. died,''
and as Jews in the WASP heartland. Berger took his religious
training from a rabbi in a nearby hospital for the mentally
retarded. Young Sandy Berger had another distinguishing feature: He
was a fervent Dodger fan in a Yankee town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I grew up is very important to what I am,'' he said.
``My perspectives are still more Millerton 1960 than Washington
2000. The small-town sense of community and social responsibility _
that's the lasting imprint of Millerton on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger likes to tell about visiting an aunt in Brooklyn when he
was 10 and sleeping fitfully all night because of the fire and
police sirens. When he asked her about them, she answered, ``Oh,
you get used to it.'' But when a siren sounded in Millerton, he
said, ``You knew that you'd know the people whose house was on
fire, so you never got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell University, his good nature and his organizational
ability led him into student politics. As head of the
interfraternity council, he came under the sway of an assistant
dean, Albert Miles, who got him interested in questions of social
justice. He asked civil rights leaders like Stokely Carmichael to
Cornell to speak, he fought discrimination in the fraternities,
closing down one that barred blacks from a party, and he persuaded
James Perkins, the university president, to fly to Cornell a group
of black schoolchildren from Brooklyn who had created a a black
history project that no one had come to see. The project was
displayed at the Student Union.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Cornell, where he met his wife, Susan, with whom he has
lived in the same unpretentious house for 26 years, Berger
encountered an important intellectual mentor, George McT. Kahin, a
historian of Southeast Asia. He took the course on Vietnam taught
by Professor Kahin, whose books became the testaments of the
anti-war movement. Berger's opposition to the war derived from that
course, he says today, as does his habit of ``questioning
everything that I read.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never marched against the war, preferring, as he put it,
to work within the system, first as a summer intern in Washington
for Rep. Joseph Resnick, a millionaire television-antenna
manufacturer from the Catskills. At Harvard Law School, Berger
volunteered first for Eugene McCarthy, then for Robert F. Kennedy,
displaying the kind of pragmatism that sometimes gets him in
trouble in his present job with more ideologically rigorous types.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, on the dovish McGovern campaign, he met a man
wearing a Colonel Sanders white suit, Bill Clinton, and the two
quickly became buddies. McGovern's ignominious defeat is regarded
by most politicians as an instructive example of what happens when
a candidate totally loses touch with an electorate, but Berger
views him as an ``inspiring'' leader, describing the 1972 fiasco as
the result of tactical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The dovish theme continued at Hogan &AMP; Hartson, one of
Washington's premier law firms, where Berger, who represented
Japanese and other clients, talked often with the firm's most
eminent figure, former Sen. J. William Fulbright, the godfather of
the anti-war movement. When he went into the State Department in
the Carter administration, he fought in the trenches alongside the
dovish secretary, Cyrus Vance, against the more hawkish national
security adviser, Brzezinski, and resolved to do all he could to
avoid such fights if he ever found himself in a position of real
power.
</P>
<P>
   However much he may have hated the Vietnam War, Berger is, along
with most of his peers, in essence a consensus-seeker and a
deal-cutter, and work as a trade lawyer strengthened those
tendencies. His contacts with Asia gave him a profound belief in
free trade as a means of knitting the world together _ a view that
would color his subsequent attitudes toward China, the issue on
which he has probably spent more time than any other in the White
House.

 &HT;    Taft quietly awards cabinet with raises
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The members of Gov. Bob Taft's cabinet had been
on the job for no more than six months when Taft quietly awarded
most of them pay raises of at least 3 percent on July 1, the start
of the state's new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the previously unannounced raises on Tuesday,
Scott Milburn, Taft' press secretary, said: ``I didn't think it was
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Milburn said it has been standard practice for several years to
award raises at the start of the fiscal year to most state
employees. The governor wanted to follow that practice for his 23
cabinet members, even though they had not been working a full year,
said Milburn. Had Taft not acted, cabinet members would have had to
wait 18 months before getting raises at the beginning of the next
fiscal year on July 1, 2000, Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the raises ``merit-based, cost-of-living
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Milburn and three other top staffers in the governor's office _
Chief of Staff Brian Hicks, Communications Director Mary Anne
Sharkey and Chief Policy Advisor Scott Borgemenke _ also got 3
percent raises.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn said that Taft believes one of his biggest challenges in
putting a cabinet together is competing with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these people are top notch individuals who would
command much higher salaries in the private sector,'' Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the raises, 11 cabinet members had salaries larger
than the salaries of their predecessors under Gov. George
Voinovich. Ten cabinet members started their jobs with salaries
equal to those serving under Voinovich and two of Taft's directors
made starting salaries lower than those paid to Voinovich's
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen members of Taft's cabinet earn more than $100,000.
Just six of Voinovich's cabinet members earned that much.
</P>
<P>
   The raises disturbed two Miami Valley lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was very smart thing to do,'' said state Sen.
Charles Horn, R-Centerville. ``If these people started out making
more than Voinovich's people and they just came on board, I don't
think that is very judicious. I'm a fiscal conservative and my
constituents feel that way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rhine McLin, D-Dayton, said the state has more
important things to spend money on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you still have a large percentage of Ohioans working two
jobs to make ends meet, it's ridiculous to grant raises to people
who are making that kind of money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the legislature earn $42,427. An effort to raise
their salaries to $44,927 beginning in 2002 died last June as the
result of partisan bickering in the House. Legislators have not had
a raise since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cabinet raise went to Dr. James ``Nick'' Baird Jr.,
the state health director, who started on June 1 with a salary of
$109,886. His salary was increased to $113,182 on July 1. On July
31, he received a special physician's supplement of about $22,600,
taking his salary to about $135,800. The legislature approved
giving supplements to physicians who fill the health director's
job. The health director under Voinovich was not a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the raise, Baird receives about $110,000 less than
he did at the private health care job he left to take the state
position, Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was very pleased to be able to recruit him. He's
talented and experienced,'' said Mi,b 5/8rn, whose own salary went
from $83,990 to $86,258 with the raise.
</P>
<P>
   Baird and James Conrad, director of the Bureau of Worker's
Compensation whose salary is $142,043, are the two cabinet members
who earn more than Taft. The governor's salary is $119,235.

WASHINGTON: White House.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House: A Friend of Bill's Who Never Left
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Carter administration, the years from 1968 to
1992 were Republican years, but Berger found ways to keep a
political oar in. He formed an important alliance with Pamela
Harriman, the Washington social doyenne, writing speeches for her
to give her the cloak of political gravitas she longed for, and
benefiting, in turn, from her wealth and connections.
</P>
<P>
   One button on Mrs. Harriman's telephone in her elegant
Georgetown residence was marked ``Sandy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton lost a re-election bid as Arkansas governor in
1980, Berger persuaded Mrs. Harriman to put the young ex-governor
on the board of her political action committee, which came to be a
major fund-raising arm of the Democratic Party. That gave Clinton a
reason to come to Washington to schmooze. Eight years later, when
Clinton muffed a big chance, delivering an agonizingly boring
speech at the party convention in Atlanta, the Berger-Harriman team
stepped in again, organizing a midnight dinner to pick up the
Clintons' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ran in 1992, Berger joined him as a senior
foreign-policy adviser. When Clinton won, Berger helped persuade
him to send Mrs. Harriman to Paris as ambassador. Berger was
offered the national security adviser's job but demurred on the
grounds of limited experience, suggesting Tony Lake instead. Berger
became Lake's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   But during Clinton's first term, says a person who held a senior
position during that period, ``everyone with a problem in the
security area went to Sandy _ honest, helpful, Sandy, who never
lied _ and he built up a tremendous amount of credibility that
helped him enormously once he took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has worked hard to maintain his network, talking by
telephone as many as a dozen times a day with Albright, meeting
once a week for breakfast with her and other security
``principals'' such as CIA Director George J. Tenet, and visiting
the Hill often.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials in the State Department and the Defense
Department praise Berger's trustworthiness and his ability to run
meetings, though some of the generals and admirals are not entirely
comfortable with him or any of the old anti-war crowd and their
brand of cautious interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds of friendship between Clinton and Berger _ one of the
few who has served the entire two terms at the White House under
four chiefs of staff _ have held, even in bad times, such as the
town meeting on Iraq in Columbus, Ohio, in May of last year, which
ended with Cohen and Albright being shouted down. Berger himself
describes the event as ``a complete fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any sign that Berger's standing with the president
has slipped because of the administration's difficulties with
China, the country with which he is most closely identified. It is
the country whose development, he once said, ``will have the
biggest impact on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   To shape that development, Berger has championed a policy of
engagement, in which the United States has tried to bind China to
the United States through economic and security arrangements. But a
lot of things have gone wrong lately, from illicit Chinese campaign
contributions to the Democrats to the accidental bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's biggest setback on the China front came in April when
he was unable to persuade Clinton to sign a trade deal during Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the White House. Despite his clout
with Clinton, he was outflanked on this occasion by John S.
Podesta, the White House chief of staff. Podesta had the foresight
to win the backing of a man even more influential than Berger,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and they persuaded the president
to hold out for more concessions to placate Congress. Despite
efforts to regroup, no treaty has been signed yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for Berger personally were charges that he reacted
too passively when told about the suspected Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets. He insists that he acted properly when told of the
charges, even though he was late in briefing Clinton, waiting until
after March of this year, on detailed charges that Berger had
learned in July 1997. When asked if he felt whether he had dropped
the ball in any way, either in terms of substance or in terms of
appearances, Berger replied, cold-eyed, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's cherished reputation on the Hill has nonetheless taken
a hit, with several influential members of Congress calling for his
resignation. These calls have subsided, but he remains ``very
exposed and very vulnerable on this,'' according to a government
China specialist who admires him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best link we have with China,'' the specialist said.
``But he is viewed by our critics as someone who cares more about
China than the United States, and that limits his ability to take
initiatives with China. You need to explain the bombing, but you
can't send Sandy to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an inescapable sense that the Administration makes
policy on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the former White House press secretary,
concedes that ``we don't have a new definition of the U.S. role in
the world yet.'' In some moods, Berger sounds as if that's fine
with him. In 1991, he said during a panel discussion that most
``grand strategies'' were after-the-fact rationales developed to
explain successful ad hoc decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation, Berger said that he prefers to ``worry
about today today and tomorrow tomorrow.''

 &HT;    No verdict in Martin case
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal jury reached no verdict on money-laundering
charges against Dolphins receiver Tony Martin in its first day of
deliberations Tuesday, but will resume today.
</P>
<P>
   That meant no immediate decision for Martin and his family, who
waited in courthouse hallways, but there were indications that the
jury is closely examining charges against Martin's co-defendant,
convicted drug dealer Rickey Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of eight women and four men, all of whom happen to be
black or Hispanic, asked for transcripts of testimony by witnesses
related to Brownlee's portion of the case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Moore told jurors to use their
collective memory because no transcripts existed for the portions
they requested and could take at least a day to produce.
</P>
<P>
   One juror must register her child for school so deliberations
were not scheduled to resume until 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Martin faces three to five years in prison on five
counts related to money-laundering. The Dolphins have not ruled out
playing him this season even if he is convicted _ presuming he
remains free on bond awaiting sentencing or appeals, and the league
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee, who has already served seven years on two 1980s drug
convictions, faces up to life in prison for convictions on 11
charges against him, including trafficking in cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's lawyers said it is impossible to know how long it might
take for the jury to reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be they decide quickly on one (defendant) but not the
other,'' attorney Howard Srebnick said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberating about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, following
closing statements by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing, which began Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron
DeWaard reminded jurors that they do not set the sentences, and are
not allowed to let ``sympathy'' affect their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed aimed at jurors who may be unsure about voting to
convict Martin, whose lawyers say he was only trying to help
Brownlee, a longtime family friend whom Martin calls uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin gave Brownlee ``the benefit of the doubt,'' Srebnick told
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   DeWaard said an NFL player should know better before agreeing to
write checks for more than $200,000 for cash from someone
previously convicted on drug charges. The checks were for cars and
attorney fees for Brownlee.

NASA LOOKS TO INFLATABLE MODULE TO INCREASE ASTRONAUTS' LIVING
SPACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA unveiled a strategy Tuesday to triple the size of
the living and recreational accommodations for astronauts assigned
to the international space station if it can find a business
partner by October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involves commercial development of an inflatable module
called TransHab, which engineers at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston proposed more than two years ago as the living quarters for
Mars-bound astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is eager to use the module on the station, replacing the
original plan for a smaller aluminum cylinder. If successful, the
venture could open the door to further commercial activities aboard
the new orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Space buffs have embraced the use of an inflatable module,
believing it might encourage space tourism or expeditions to the
moon, to an asteroid, or to Mars. But some congressional members
oppose changes that could drive station costs higher. Also, NASA is
vague about the terms of the commercial arrangement it would accept
to overcome the cost and liability issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very complex,'' said Dan Tam, a special assistant to
NASA chief Dan Goldin. ``But if we do it right, we could open a
whole new horizon for commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to change some rules and kick some butt, let's do
it,'' he told about 150 people from the aerospace industry who
gathered Tuesday in south Houston for a three-day forum on space
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   Time is a factor, however. Construction of the $100 billion
international outpost began late last year. The aluminum crew
habitation module is to launch in November 2004, raising the
permanent astronaut complement to seven.
</P>
<P>
   In order to substitute the inflatable module, NASA must have a
business partner by the end of October, said Tam. NASA would invest
no more than $200 million, the cost of completing the aluminum
module.
</P>
<P>
   Though not yet outfitted, the aluminum habitation module is 28
feet long and 14.5 feet in diameter, offering about 4,400 cubic
feet of internal space, for astronaut sleep chambers, a galley,
exercise area, health station, shower and wardroom.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $2.5 million on development, engineers at the
Johnson Space Center have successfully constructed and tested a
prototype of an inflatable that is 36 feet long and 27 feet in
diameter, offering three times the volume, said Donna Fender, the
NASA TransHab project manager.
</P>
<P>
   With the larger volume, the inflatable can be separated into a
three-level structure, allowing the astronauts to outfit the top
floor as an exercise area and health station, the second floor with
bedrooms, and the bottom floor for a large galley and wardroom that
would enable up to a dozen space travelers to dine together or
gather for planning sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ground tests at Johnson last year demonstrated that the
inflatable prototype can be folded into a 27-foot by 14-foot
package for launch by the space shuttle and that it will bear up
under at least two and a half times the normal sea-level air
pressure the astronauts plan to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5-foot thick outer wall of the inflatable is designed like
a bulletproof vest and prevents penetration by a 1-inch projectile
moving at 15,000 mph, surpassing the protection of the aluminum
module. Tests have shown that the fabric module offers superior
radiation protection as well, Fender said.
</P>
<P>
   The TransHab concept also has the endorsement of Shannon Lucid,
the astronaut who holds the U.S. record for time in space, 188
days, established aboard Russia's Mir space station in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The galley, exercise area and sleep quarters were clustered
aboard the Russian outpost, creating clutter and often making it
difficult for even small crews to separate their duties.
</P>
<P>
   Lucid stressed the importance of privacy and pleasant
surroundings for those who will spend three to six months at a time
on the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not have a good place to live, you don't have a
productive crew,'' Lucid said.

 &HT;    Ohio congressman to visit North Korea
 &HT;    By Scottt Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea has retreated from the brink of famine,
and so far hasn't made good on recent threats to test launch a
long-range missile, creating an unexpected lull in the turbulent
life of the last Stalinist nation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall ( D-Ohio) sees it as a good time to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Hall will arrive in the North Korean capitol of Pyongyang on
Thursday to begin a three-day trek through the rural areas of the
country that only recently began climbing out of a massive food
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, an expert on hunger and humanitarian issues, plans to
monitor the distribution channels of U.S. food aid by meeting with
workers from the United Nations, private charities and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is making his fifth trip to North Korea since 1996, when
the first signs of starvation began appearing. The communist
country invited Hall to view the deepening crisis first-hand to
help make the case for international food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the head of World Food Programme of the UN returned
from a trip into the secretive country and said conditions had
significantly improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an absolute difference in the children,'' Catherine
Bertini told The Washington Post. ``Before, we saw children who
were almost skeletal. You could see the bones in their head.''
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea continues to rely on international food
donations to provide about one quarter of the 4 million tons of
food needed to feed its 23 million people. And Bertini warned that
any disruption of that aid would have dire consequences, noting,
too, that she was not permitted to visit many areas of the country
where people may still be suffering from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also is worried that while conditions may no longer be
deadly, the country remains deeply in need of assistance. The
country still cannot grow enough food to feed its people, and
Hall's office said ``the pipeline of international food aid is
running dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall plans to meet with top government officials in North Korea,
as well as the president of South Korea, Kim Dae Jung. Hall will
hold a press conference during his two days in Seoul early next
week.

AD COLUMN: SORRELL RAISES ANTE, INCENTIVES AND POTENTIAL PAYOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ To the British tabloids, Martin Sorrell is no ordinary
advertising executive. He is ``Mr 35M,'' as the bold-faced headline
read in The Sun last week. At the end of next month, Sorrell, chief
executive of the WPP Group PLC, will receive shares of the company
worth about (PS)35 million ($56 million) as part of a much-disputed
performance-based compensation package that he created four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And if he has his way, he and 14 other top executives could
collect (PS)100 million ($160 million) more as part of a new
compensation plan he introduced last week.
</P>
<P>
   The board of WPP, which owns J. Walter Thompson Co. and Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Worldwide, will not vote on the compensation plan for
several weeks, but the issue is already stirring discussion in
Britain's advertising community.
</P>
<P>
   A $56 million payday in the United States may not raise too many
eyebrows for a chief executive of a major company with offices all
over the world, but in Britain, which keeps a watchful eye over
``fat cat'' compensation packages, Sorrell's deal is far from
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   While senior executives at Omnicom and Interpublic in the United
States have become rich as the value of their stock options has
climbed with the market, most advertising executives in Britain
tend to get standard salaries without lottery-like stock options or
huge bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the stock option plans that U.S. executives often get,
however, the incentive plan that Sorrell is proposing has a couple
of strings attached. The proposal would require executives to sink
almost a year's worth of their salaries into the company beyond any
profits they might have taken previously from shares of WPP and
would require them to stay locked in for four years. In addition,
the company has to rank as the No. 1 or No. 2 advertising and
communications company in the world, based on its share price and
reinvested dividends. If the company falls short of that goal, the
executives would still be eligible for smaller compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky gamble for Sorrell, 53, and his 14 colleagues
because the advertising business, so often fickle, is hard to
predict as companies move their accounts from agency to agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word entrepreneur means risk taker,'' Sorrell said in an
interview last week. ``I'm committing virtually all of my net worth
to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm not cashing in to reload,'' explaining that he
is not going to sell any of the shares he will get next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell has been a bit of a gambler since he took control of WPP
in 1986. He engineered the first hostile takeover of an advertising
agency, J. Walter Thompson in 1987, and then two years later bought
one of Madison Avenue's most famous names, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, for an
astonishing figure at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The buying spree pushed WPP to within an eyelash of going under,
as debts taken on during the acquisition binge were aggravated by
the worldwide advertising recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sorrell has succeeded in bringing WPP back from the
brink, he wants in on the action. ``From a personal point of view,
I always wanted a major equity stake in a company,'' said Sorrell,
who left Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi to take the reins of WPP. ``I'm trying
to put us on par with our U.S. competition.''
</P>
<P>
   As he proposes radically changing the compensation structure,
others in Britain's advertising community question whether the
creative side of the business will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will ask whether an incentive scheme which is linked
entirely to WPP's stock price will serve to further erode the
creative standing of the two networks by making City and Wall
Street performance, rather than advertising pedigree, the prime
motivator,'' wrote Caroline Marshall, deputy editor of the British
trade magazine Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, ``There will, of course, be concerns from those
in ad land who resent Sorrell's formidable unseen influence or who
detest his financial leverage over treasured advertising icons like
J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Sorrell, all of this is just business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the holdings of my peers, compared with me, the
compensations are not dissimilar,'' he said. ``But I'm putting my
money where my mouth is.''

EDITORIAL: A CAUTIOUS RATE INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board is acting cautiously in trying to slow
the American economy and head off a resurgence of inflation.
Investors appear to be confident that such a gradual approach will
have a minimal impact on the economy. In the near term, they are
probably right.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed on Tuesday raised the Federal funds rate, the rate at
which banks borrow from each other, by a quarter of a percentage
point, to 5.25 percent. It also raised the discount rate, at which
banks borrow from the Fed when they are in severe need of capital,
by the same amount, to 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had signaled the increases in
congressional testimony at which he warned that the economy was
growing too rapidly to prevent inflationary pressures in a very
tight labor market. As a result, the Fed's move Tuesday surprised
no one.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street now expects that the Fed is through raising rates
for the rest of this year, and that the next meeting of the Fed's
Open Market Committee, on Oct. 5, will be a nonevent. It also
believes that neither corporate profits nor financial markets will
be damaged by higher interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial
average, which closed at a record high on Monday, slipped a bit
Tuesday, but the more broadly based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and
Nasdaq composite indexes advanced. Bond prices also rose, sending
long-term interest rates down a bit even as the Fed was pushing up
short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with the domestic economy strong but fears of
worldwide recession intense, the Fed cut interest rates three
times. In explaining its decision to raise rates Tuesday, the Fed
said that ``the degree of monetary ease required to address the
global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer
consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.''
Still, the fact that the Fed sees no need to reverse all of last
year's cuts is viewed by Wall Street as a sign that Greenspan and
his colleagues are not going to spoil the party that has sent stock
prices to unprecedented valuations and roused fears of a financial
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the Fed will be forced to tighten credit
again this year, even if inflation does not accelerate. That could
happen if the dollar comes under pressure. It has already begun to
weaken against both the Japanese yen and the euro.
</P>
<P>
   That weakening might be the first indication that investors are
beginning to move capital overseas, a potentially serious problem
given that the United States must continue to attract large amounts
of capital to finance its big trade deficit. Higher interest rates
are one way to attract that capital, and a very weak dollar might
force the Fed to raise rates again.

   The Fed is acting responsibly in trying to slow the economy
gradually. President Clinton and Congress should cooperate by
pursuing a lean fiscal policy. In particular, as Greenspan has
asked, they should avoid tax cuts that would unnecessarily
stimulate the economy and increase the chances that the Fed will
have to raise interest rates again.

 &HT;    The good, the bad and the ugly: Reds fall to Braves again
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The good news: The Atlanta Braves stole zero bases
against the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night in Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: They didn't have to steal any.
</P>
<P>
   The real bad news: The Braves hammered the Reds again, 6-4, the
fifth straight time this season they've taken care of business
against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The awful news: The Houston Astros were given a chance to extend
their lead in the National League Central to 1 games if they beat
the New York Mets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the recent effectiveness of Cincinnati starter Pete
Harnisch (eight straight victories) and the recent ineffectiveness
of Atlanta starter John Smoltz (winless in nine starts, during
which he was 0-4) could reverse the depths of despair in which the
Reds fall against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch gave up a season's high six runs and ten hits, tying
his season's high, and was gone before the sixth inning was over.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who pitched a one-hit shutout against the Reds here
April 30, is battling an elbow problem and has altered his delivery
from straight over the top to three-quarters. It doesn't matter
against the Reds. He is 11-0 against Cincinnati in his last 14
tries.
</P>
<P>
   Negative numbers continue to pile up for the Reds against the
Braves _ nine total runs (1.8 per game) and 18 hits (3.6 per game)
in the five losses. By losing the first two of his three-game
series, the Reds won't extend their streak of winning nine straight
series. Instead, they extend a losing streak, eight straight series
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After Smoltz quickly put down the Reds 1-2-3 in the first, the
Braves became the first team in Harnisch's 26 starts to score more
than one run in the first inning, putting two on the board on five
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams opened with a double, the 50th straight game in
which the Braves have hit at least one double. Williams took third
on Bret Boone's deep fly to right and scored on a jam-job flare
single to left by Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko and Andruw Jones singled for the second run, then
Jose Hernandez made it three straight hits with a single off second
baseman Pokey Reese's glove, but when Klesko tried to score Reese
threw him out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds grabbed a 3-2 lead in the fourth when Aaron Boone drove
his ninth home run into the left field seats, scoring Barry Larkin
(single) and Eddie Taubensee (error).
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch retired 13 of 14 from the second through the fifth,
including 10 straight entering the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The first five Braves reached base in the sixth, four hits and a
walk, and Harnisch was finished after giving up four more runs,
leaving with a 6-3 deficit. Klesko had a run-scoring single, Andruw
Jones ripped a two-run single and Hernandez crushed a two-run
double over center fielder Mike Cameron's head. Both Harnisch and
the Reds were done for the night.

INTERNET'S GOVERNING BODY DEBATES DOMAIN NAMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ A major meeting of the Internet's new
governing body opened Tuesday with the fireworks and controversy
that have become its trademark, including protests over a closed
session of one of its advisory groups and a dispute over what
should be voted on later this week.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much of the discussion was the theme that has
dominated much of the debate about the organization, the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers: how to guarantee that
individual Internet users and noncommercial interests have a voice
before it starts making key policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which has largely been busy with organizational
issues at past meetings, is scheduled to begin that process on
Thursday when it considers a proposal for cracking down on
cybersquatters _ people who buy domains with popular names or
trademarks in hopes of reselling them at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit corporation, known as Icann, was selected last
year by the U.S. Commerce Department to take over administration of
the Internet. The Internet's domain name system has been
administered until now by government contractors, including Network
Solutions, a Herndon, Va., company that built a lucrative business
as the exclusive registrar of names in the domains of .com, .net
and .org.
</P>
<P>
   One of Icann's initial charges was to open that business to
competition, creating a difficult tug of war for the board between
commercial interests who want the rules completed quickly and those
who want no decisions to be made until all Internet users can be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that big business and trademark interests have
dominated the process for drafting the proposed rules for resolving
cybersquatting disputes, a newly formed group of holders of
noncommercial domain names circulated petitions Tuesday asking that
the board delay that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the noncommercial interests said they were
concerned that the proposal needs to define cybersquatting more
narrowly to insure that free speech is protected and that large
companies cannot use the process to take domain names away from
individuals who might have a legitimate claim to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Icann board will hold a public forum on Wednesday to take
comment on that and other issues before its meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But while Icann, under pressure from the U.S. Congress, agreed
to open this board meeting to the public for the first time, some
who came here were disturbed Tuesday to find that its governmental
advisory committee was continuing to close its sessions to
outsiders. The committee is composed of representatives of national
governments and multinational organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I find it outrageous,'' said Therese Amato, who came
from Chicago to represent the Citizens' Advocacy Center, a Ralph
Nader consumer organization.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Paul Twomey, a special adviser for the
Australian government on information economy and technology, said
the group makes no policy recommendations but needs to be able to
hold candid meetings to discuss Internet issues affecting its
members.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: JESSE VENTURA GOES TO THE MAT FOR WRESTLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota made headlines Sunday night when
he returned to his roots as a professional wrestler, serving as
guest referee in a pay-per-view championship match. The combatants
included the titleholder, Stone Cold Steve Austin, a challenger
named Mankind who never appears in public without a muzzle, and a
third contender whom Ventura penalized for hitting Mankind on the
head with a folding chair. When critics protest that Ventura has
degraded his office, fans can retort that he was probably the first
referee in wrestling history who actually punished a fighter for
using a folding chair as a weapon. Who says the Reform Party is
losing its steam?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of wrestling!'' Ventura cried. ``I'm proud I was a
wrestler and I'm proud to be here tonight.'' He did not give any
indication about which part of the proceedings made his heart
swell. Perhaps it was the point at which the World Wrestling
Federation president for new media pummeled a fighter over the head
with a stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   It was darned peculiar to see Ventura flailing around in the
ring only hours before one of his advisers told CNN that the
governor wanted to concentrate on state issues and keep a low
public profile. But his appearance is just the latest evidence that
professional wrestling is taking over the world. This week it moves
into network prime time with a two-hour weekly ``WWF Smackdown'' on
UPN. There are already about 25 hours of wrestling a week on cable
TV, where it appears to perform the same function that pornography
does for the Internet _ luring viewers while the providers pretend
they're making money on less embarrassing programming. The WWF, a
Connecticut-based entertainment company, has announced plans to
sell stock and open a theme restaurant in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The key to wrestling's current influence is the fact that it is
popular with young males, who don't seem to like much of anything
else these days. Wrestling is a traditional guy thing, like the
Three Stooges or Pat Buchanan. Its villains have always been a
12-year-old boy's idea of villainy _ fighters so deranged they
practically drool, pompous foreigners who dis the United States,
pumped-up bullies who are vain about their looks. But I used to
find it kind of intriguing, in a campy sort of way. I liked
watching the evil ``manager'' distracting the referees, a group
that gave new meaning to the concept of a short attention span, so
the villain could pull out a ``foreign object'' and disable the
hapless hero. I also imagined that it provided insights into what
popular entertainment looked like around, say, 1492.
</P>
<P>
   The current version actually seems a little less violent than in
the pre-AIDS era, when a top wrestler was expected to suffer a
near-death experience in every big match, collapsing frequently and
emerging covered with blood. But it's gotten too creepy and
mean-spirited. The characters are foul-mouthed and obnoxious, the
heroes and villains pretty much interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   Like politics, wrestling seems to be suffering from a lack of
credible villains. My own personal favorite, the Russian wrestler
who boasted that the Red Army would be celebrating the Communist
capture of the world championship belt, has been swept away by the
winds of history. For a while, the WWF promoted a theme of
labor-vs.-management conflict, in which Austin pummeled various
corporate stooges, who were unable to fire him because he was
 &UR; j &LR; ust too popular. You could understand why an arena full of
blue-collar fans was on its feet for that one. But Austin has now
been displaced as champion by Mankind, whose gimmick is stuffing a
dirty sock down his opponent's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, wrestling mania is a cyclical phenomenon that's just
about due to go back to ground for another long hibernation. The
next time it emerges, it may follow Ventura's lead into a full
merger with politics, another part of the American landscape that
has had trouble figuring out what its point is lately. Instead of
presidential debates we can have steel-cage death matches in which
the candidates argue health care legislation while hitting each
other over the head with campaign placards. But no folding chairs
allowed.

 &HT;    Struggling Big 12 programs get shot at resurrection with new
coachesBy Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Aware that the Baylor Bears were one of the most
penalized football teams in the Big 12 Conference last year, new
coach Kevin Steele watched curiously this spring as an officiating
crew worked the Bears' first scrimmage of his tenure in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six penalties later, the scrimmage ended. Mercifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much hair,'' Steele said. ``But what little I had
almost disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting a struggling program can be a hairy experience for
a new coaching staff, more at some schools than others. Three
coaches are undertaking the task this year in the Big 12. Two _ Bob
Stoops at Oklahoma and Gary Barnett at Colorado _ are trying to
recapture past glory. Then there's Steele, trying for starters to
simply reacquaint the Bears with some degree of consistent success
after the disastrous two-year reign of Dave Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an attitudinal problem, although it's not a bad one,''
Steele said. ``But when you have a group of players experiencing
losses and failures, they start to doubt everything around them.
And when adversity strikes, they expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude adjustments required of Stoops and Barnett aren't
as severe as those at Baylor. The Bears have never escaped from the
Big 12 cellar and have won just eight overall games and three
conference games in the league's three-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, who orchestrated the turnaround of Northwestern's
sad-sack football image, inherits from Rick Neuheisel a Colorado
team that some think has the potential to challenge Nebraska and
Kansas State for the North Division crown.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops, like Steele a first-year head coach, oversees a Sooners
program light-years away from its nationally elite status of the
1970s and mid '80s. But OU is blessed with an abundance of talented
athletes, lacking what many believe to be only a firm sense of
direction, something that was glaringly absent in three years under
John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M Coach R.C. Slocum thinks Oklahoma could be the Big
12's surprise team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the players they have, and I think they're not that
far away,'' Slocum said. ``With the excitement of a new coach, and
if they find a quarterback, I can see them being pretty good ...
really good, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being hired as Baylor's 23rd head football coach in
mid-December, Steele probably was best known for what Bears
linebacker Rodney Smith delicately referred to as ``the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele made ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' highlights last season when,
as a third-year assistant for the NFL's Carolina Panthers, he was
jostled and grabbed by linebacker Kevin Greene in a sideline
flare-up during a game. The intensity that led to that
confrontation was noticed by the Bears in the spring, although in
much less dramatic ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears seem to respect Steele's discipline, which included
dismissing standout running back prospect Ben Gay in May for
reasons Steele declined to divulge other than to say they weren't
legal in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big thing about winning is not only trusting the person
beside you doing his job, but trusting that the coach is going to
put you in the right position to make the right play. He's shown us
he's going to do that,'' said Smith, who has moved from strong
safety. ``He gets on us to make his point, but I like the way he
does it. He doesn't put people down. He does it in a positive
manner and doesn't make a player feel like he's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele's coaching resume includes stops at Tennessee (his alma
mater, class of 1981) under Johnny Majors and Nebraska under Tom
Osborne. He recruited former Cornhuskers quarterback Tommie
Frazier, now an assistant with him at Baylor. Steele said his
philosophies have been formed by his experiences with all his
former coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a product of our environment, and I'm no different
than anyone else,'' he said. ``We've made it a point at Baylor that
everything we've done has been very positive. We're going to be
honest and not sell the players something on false pretenses. But
our guys are very hungry for success and have bought into what
we're trying to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, who last year lost back-to-back two-point decisions
at Colorado and Texas Tech en route to their second straight 2-9
season, believe a positive attitude can cure many woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the team's that bad,'' sophomore center
Joe Jackson said. ``We were close in a lot of games last year,
where a play or two could have turned it around, but we didn't have
a whole lot of confidence in the coach. We never gave up. We just
didn't have a whole lot of faith in the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added that the Bears, realistically, ``have a good
chance of being an above .500 ballclub, `` but Steele said the
record isn't his sole barometer, especially in his first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we measuring success? In actual wins and losses, or in
attitude?'' he asked. ``Coach (Joe) Gibbs told me that the first
year is more important in attitude than in numbers. The biggest
thing I can do for these guys is when they see how I react in
adverse situations. I've conditioned them that when something goes
wrong, it's not the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are players who wanted someone to show them what
to do and to have a plan they could believe in,'' Steele added.
``In our first team meeting, I told them not to believe anything I
said, that words are simply things to be used as a pattern of what
to look for in terms of actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to watch us. If our actions mirrored what we told
them, then they have something they could, and should, believe
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the Sooners' 1999 media guide doesn't show Stoops.
Instead, there's a picture of a clenched fist holding up a crimson
OU helmet, with Oklahoma's national championship seasons listed off
to the side _ 1950, 1955, 1956, 1974, 1975 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first significant reference to OU's 21st head coach
doesn't appear in the 352-page book until his biography begins on
page 34.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be successful and bring this program back to
compete for a championship,'' said the boyish-looking Stoops, who
turns 39 on Sept. 9. ``But it won't be me bringing it back. It'll
be a lot of people, from the (OU) president on down and the
commitment of our fans. They're hungry, and rightfully so. This is
a program with a lot of tradition. You don't give it to them for
all those years, then take it away and expect them to be happy
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been much for Sooners fans to be happy about
lately. OU hasn't been to a bowl game in five years and hasn't won
one since the 1993 John Hancock Bowl. Gary Gibbs was dismissed
after a 6-6 season in 1994, and the Sooners were 5-5-1 in one
ill-fated year under Howard Schnellenberger and 3-8, 4-8 and 5-6 in
three seasons under John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's 31 losses over the past five seasons are two more
than Barry Switzer compiled in his 16-year reign ending in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops has no previous head-coaching experience. He spent the
previous three years as assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator for Steve Spurrier at Florida. For seven seasons prior
to that, he was instrumental in helping Bill Snyder turn around
Kansas State's woeful program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after taking the OU job in December, Stoops raided
Snyder's staff for three important assistants, including Stoops'
younger brother Mike, Mark Mangino and Brent Venables, all of whom
had coordinating duties at K-State. And perhaps because of his
association with pass-happy Spurrier, whose son Stoops hired as
wide receivers coach at OU, Stoops' offensive coordinator is Mike
Leach, who held the same post the past two years at Kentucky with
Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want coaches who want to be at Oklahoma,'' said Stoops, a
1983 Iowa graduate. ``I work with them. They don't work for me. I
don't have ownership over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops' unassuming attitude doesn't mask his perfectionism. The
Sooners were penalized even more than Baylor last year, ranking
second in the league in infractions (114) and penalty yards (990).
Stoops made it clear immediately that that was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one and our first meeting, he let us know we were
going to be disciplined and do what's right, on and off the
field,'' safety Rodney Rideau said. ``He let us know it was this
way or the highway, and if we didn't want to do it right, we could
jump off the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The general assumption in college football is that it was only a
matter of time before OU regained its footing. Under Stoops, the
time might be sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, they just had instability here and didn't have
direction that's been uniform and established,'' he said. ``The
message to our fans is we're all going in the same direction. If we
continue to do that we have a chance to be pretty powerful. I tell
our fans that they should expect us to win and have a successful
team. I don't think they've been used to hearing that lately.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first couple of years of Neuheisel's four-year reign,
the Buffaloes made a nice human-interest story _ their
guitar-playing coach leading them on rafting and skiing trips into
the Rockies. Along the way, though, the Buffs lost their identity
from when Barnett was an assistant there from 1984 to 1991 under
Bill McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   And when they started losing games and Neuheisel bolted to
Washington, the 53-year-old Barnett was brought back from
Northwestern to restore the mindset _ and success _ that led to
CU's 1990 national championship. That, primarily, is the
smash-mouth philosophy that helped produce running back Rashaan
Salaam's Heisman Trophy season in 1994, as opposed to the
air-it-out finesse of Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991 we were a real physical football team, offensively and
defensively, and we took our identity from that,'' Barnett said of
his last season as a CU assistant. ``Now we're more of a finesse
team on both sides of the ball, but it's my belief that to have a
chance in this conference we've got to get back to the style of
play we had in the early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Buffs spent the spring toughening up. It was an
eye-opening, and not unwelcome, experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a change for the better,'' said offensive guard
Ryan Johanningmeier, a 6-foot-7-inch, 310-pound senior All-America
candidate. ``In this conference, you can't expect to go out on
Saturday and just be physical if you haven't been physical all week
in practice. You have to be prepared for it, and we're going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added safety Rashidi Barnes: ``As a defensive player,
smash-mouth football is what you live for. Coach Barnett is
bringing that to Colorado, and that's what a lot of people have
been waiting for. As players, we like what he's brought to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, almost hired at Texas as John Mackovic's successor
before the Longhorns fell in love with Mack Brown, has returned to
a potential bonanza. The Buffaloes welcome back nine offensive and
seven defensive starters that many believe should have done better
than their 8-4 record, considering they lost four of their last six
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett stressed that Colorado won't abandon the passing game in
its quest to be more physical. He said the Buffs have installed
more of a West Coast offense to take advantage of quarterback Mike
Moschetti's running ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a 50-50 team,'' Barnett said. ``We're not going
to run the ball any more, really. We just want to run it better.
We're not going to force it, but at the same time we're going to
believe in it, and we're going to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado ranked 11th in the Big 12 last year in rushing offense,
ahead of only Baylor. The Buffs averaged only 3.0 yards per carry
and 123.2 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took it as a slap in the face,'' Johanningmeier said.
``This year, the new emphasis on the ground game, and our new
attitude should be conducive to a good running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, a 1969 Missouri graduate, was a high school coach in
Colorado Springs before becoming head coach at NAIA Fort Lewis
College in Durango, Colo., in 1982. After two years, he joined
McCartney's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is literally coming home for me,'' he said of his return
to the Buffs. ``My entire professional life was spent in Colorado
except for the last seven years. This was a chance to come home.''

PUBLIC NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT BUSH'S PAST; FOR RHODE ISLAND
CANDIDATE, HONESTY IS BEST; MCCAIN'S ABORTION PROBLEM

   TEXAS: Voters Seem Inclined to Forgive and Forget
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Gov. George W. Bush of Texas used drugs may still
be good grist for the media mill. But evidence is building that the
American public is not overly concerned about the issue and would
be inclined to forgive Bush if it turns out that, to use his
phrase, when he was young and irresponsible, he was young and
irresponsible, and tried a snort or two of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In a new ABC News poll, more than half of the respondents say
the governor should not answer the drug question. And better than
three of every four say that if he never does, his refusal will not
affect their opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling, better than three of every four respondents
say that should the governor confess to having tried cocaine in his
youth, their opinion of him will not change.
</P>
<P>
   Another new poll, this one a CNN/Time survey, came up with
similar results, though not weighted quite as heavily in Bush's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   There also was an added question in that poll. Asked whether
they thought Bush had used cocaine at some point in his life, the
number of respondents who thought he had exceeded the number who
thought he had not by almost 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   In neither poll is there any significant evidence that the drug
controversy is likely to cost Bush votes in the coming Republican
primaries and caucuses. Nor has it hurt him in theoretical matchups
with Vice President Al Gore, the current front-running Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still leads his closest Republican rival in national polls,
Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president, by a good 40
points. And he still leads Gore by a good dozen.
</P>
<P>
   RHODE ISLAND: In Rhode Island, a Decision to Tell All
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts say that the ABC and CNN/Time poll
results indicate that the American public may be growing more
tolerant of wrongdoing by public figures, in part because so much
wrongdoing has been in the news in recent years, especially
presidential wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to past drug usage, at least one candidate,
Mayor Lincoln Chafee of Warwick, R.I., is not taking the public's
tolerance for wrongdoing for granted, if that tolerance is indeed
growing. Having watched Bush swing and twist on the drug issue, he
figures that the best course is not only to trust the tolerance of
the American voter but also to tell the truth, and the whole truth,
right up front. Get it out and get it over with, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the political game, that is known not just as forthright
honesty but also as ``inoculation.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, Chafee, a Republican who is running to succeed his
father, John Chafee, in the U.S. Senate, did not hesitate when a
television interviewer asked, ``Have you ever used drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have,'' he replied, confessing that while he was in
college in the early 1970s he had inhaled marijuana and snorted
cocaine ``several times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were very tumultuous times,'' he went on. ``I'm not
proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he told The Providence Journal that having watched the
media doggedly press Bush for an answer, he had anticipated that
he, too, would face questions about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled with what's the politically correct answer,'' he
said. ``But in the end, honesty is the best policy. It was part of
the culture. People are tolerant and understanding. If you're
forthright and honest with the public and you've got nothing to
hide, I don't see why it's such a big story. If you try to cover it
up, it becomes a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the press overdoing the looking into candidates' past?
</P>
<P>
   ``They enjoy getting on the trail of what they think is a story,
even if the public just isn't interested in it,'' Chafee replied.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Confusion Follows McCain on Abortion
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been getting
some pretty good political reviews as he has crisscrossed the
country in quest of the Republican presidential nomination. His
organizing and fund raising and campaign appearances have been
going well, and many political analysts have come to see him as the
candidate best positioned to be his party's alternative choice
should George W. Bush falter.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly there is trouble on the horizon for McCain, trouble
as serious as any he has confronted thus far in the campaign year.
He has run afoul of the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of two decades, he has been an outspoken
opponent of abortion, especially Roe vs. Wade, the landmark
decision that protects abortion rights. But a statement he made
last Thursday on the issue in an interview with The San Francisco
Chronicle has left people on both sides confused as to where he now
stands. Discussing Roe vs. Wade, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be
repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in
the short term, or even the long term, I would not support repeal
of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X-number of women in
America to illegal and dangerous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he misspeak? Was he edging toward abortion rights? Or, like
some of the more moderate Republican candidates, such as Bush and
Mrs. Dole, was he simply trying to push the issue off the front
burner because it was too politically hot and divisive, a tricky
move in itself?
</P>
<P>
   His office says that all he was saying was that if Roe vs. Wade
was repealed, repeal should be accompanied by expansion of adoption
and family counseling programs so as to minimize the rush to
illegal abortions that surely would follow.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee says that sounds like
back-pedaling. The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League worries that it is ``political posturing.'' And, summing up
the view of some of the more conservative Republican contenders,
Steve Forbes, the publisher, says McCain has lost his ideological
way and is suddenly ``stuttering and stammering.''

CHINA _ On one side is the well-connected and powerful Elizabeth
Mann, head of the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix and China's
most important business connection in Arizona. On the other is
Jianwei Ding, who worked for Mann when he was a rising executive
star in the Phoenix operations of COFCO, the Chinese
government-owned corporate giant that owns the Cultural Center. For
the past three years, Mann, 47, and Ding, 33, have been locked in a
series of legal skirmishes in Maricopa County Superior Court,
accusing each other of fraud and self-dealing. Last month, their
battle was extended to a congressional investigation in Washington.

JONES BACK ON TRACK IN 200
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones did not dwell on her disappointing
third-place finish in the long jump at the World Championships. In
fact, Jones had little time to think about much at all between the
long jump Monday night and the first round of the 200 meters
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The setback in the long jump ended Jones' bid for an
unprecedented four gold medals. With just five hours sleep, Jones
was back on the track in pursuit of her second gold medal of the
championships in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won both her heats Tuesday to advance to tonight's
semifinals. The Thousand Oaks High graduate won her first-round
heat in 22.69 and returned in the evening to win her quarterfinal
in 22.45.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, ran a controlled race to come from behind and slip
past Fatima Yusef of Nigeria by three-hundredths of a second in the
first round. In the quarters, Jones eased at the finish after
taking command around the curve, edging Merlene Frazier of Jamaica
by 0.03.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the world leader at 21.81, is the fourth-fastest
qualifier for the semifinals. Beverly McDonald of Jamaica is the
top qualifier at 22.26, followed by Yusef at 22.28 and Muriel
Hurtis of France at 22.31. Inger Miller, the 100-meter runner-up,
also advanced to the 200 semifinals with two heat victories,
including a 22.49 effort in the second round to win by nearly
three-tenths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fast times were the last thing on Jones' mind. Jones did
not get to sleep until 2 a.m. after drug testing following the long
jump and had to rise at 7 a.m. and make her way to the track for
the first race of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just standing behind the blocks where I was supposed to
be visualizing the race and I was visualizing getting back into the
van and going back to my bed for two or three hours before the next
round,'' Jones said. ``It wasn't as it looked. I don't feel as
sharp as I've been, but that's to be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who already won the 100 meters Sunday night in a
championship record to defend her world title, has a hectic
schedule through four days of the nine-day meet: She ran in four
100-meter races and two long jump rounds in addition to Tuesday's
heats. She will also compete in either the 400- or 1,600-meter
relay.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who plans to try for five gold medals in the 2000
Olympics in the 100, 200, long jump and both relays, is leaning
toward the longer relay to gain experience in running a 400-meter
leg before next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow will be easy compared to my schedule the last few
days,'' Jones said. ``I'm just going to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Washington won the men's discus for the only gold medal
for the U.S. on Tuesday, knocking off the German duo of world
record-holder Jurgen Schult and four-time champion Lars Riedel.
Washington responded with a mark of 226 feet, 8 inches on his sixth
and final throw to overtake Schult (223-8) and Riedel (223-4).
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 400-meter semifinals, USC senior Jerome Davis, the
1998 NCAA champion and 1999 World University Games champion,
clocked 44.51 to move into second on the all-time Trojans list
behind Quincy Watts' 43.50 mark to win the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, failed to qualify for the finals despite having
the fifth-fastest time of both semifinals. He ran faster than
Jerome Young's 44.55 winning time in the other semifinal but
finished fifth in a semifinal won by two-time defending champion
Michael Johnson in 43.95.
</P>
<P>
   With the disadvantage of running in lane 2, Davis was out-leaned
at the tape by Mark Richardson of Great Britain (44.47) by four
hundredths for the final qualifying spot. Only the top four from
each semifinal advance to the final. Runner-up Alejandro Cardenas
of Mexico and third-place Sanderlei Claro Parrela of Brazil, both
timed in 44.37, set a Mexican national record and South American
record, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish there were more races like this during the year at
a big championship meet with everyone running so fast,'' said
Davis, who will also run on the U.S. 1,600-meter team. ``If I ran
in the other race, I would have definitely been in the final. I
guess it just wasn't my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a hard-luck day for Mark Crear of Valencia and pole
vaulter Jeff Hartwig. Crear, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in
the 110-meter hurdles, was rejected in his appeal to be reinstated
after disqualification for two false starts in Monday's second
round.
</P>
<P>
   In pole vault qualifying, Hartwig, the winner of the U.S.
championships in June with an American-record 19-9, missed three
times at 18-8{ and failed to qualify for the final after suffering
a bruise on his right thigh and knee during his first attempt.

CONVICTED KILLER ARRESTED AFTER 8-YEAR `FISHING TRIP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE and CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Eight years ago, convicted killer Alan Echols
said he was going fishing and left before a judge could sentence
him to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing trip ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Echols, a Raytown, Mo., resident who was convicted of stabbing
an Independence man 61 times with a large hunting knife, was
arrested at a truck stop near Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that capture, prosecutors said, was another strange twist
in a bizarre case.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Echols did not deny he stabbed Ronald Nichols on Oct.
12, 1990, in the parking lot of a Kansas City are bar. Echols'
lawyer described him as a ``lovesick puppy,'' guilty of only
second-degree murder. Echols said he killed because he loved
Nichols' wife, Billie Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1991, a Jackson County jury convicted Echols of
first-degree murder, which carries a sentence of life without
parole. But in an unusual move, the judge allowed him to remain
free on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Echols, now 35, vanished after he told his parents he was going
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least 1994, he has been living in Shreveport under an
alias. Ironically, prosecutors said, the woman he loved helped end
his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's wife, Billie, sometimes visited Echols in
Louisiana, said Kevin Pose, assistant county prosecutor. She
recently told an acquaintance who Echols was and that man alerted
authorities, said Pose.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Police Detective Al DeValkenaere said Billie Nichols
was part of an ongoing investigation and declined to comment
further. She has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   DeValkenaere said the source on Thursday told authorities he
knew where to find a killer featured recently on ``America's Most
Wanted,'' which carried a report on the search for Echols. He knew
details about the slaying, about the slayer's and widow's families
and about things that the victim said to the slayer before the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The source gave authorities the name Robert Byle _ a man who
died in 1972. Officials checked the photograph on Byle's driver's
license. It resembled Echols, now with glasses and a full beard,
DeValkenaere said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities called Byle's number and the answering machine said,
``Sorry, I got called away for the weekend. If you are calling
about the car, leave a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities called Monday and left a message, pretending to be
interested in buying the car. Echols called back and made an
appointment to meet ``the buyer'' at 10 a.m. Tuesday, DeValkenaere
said.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to arrest Echols at his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source told us he would either commit suicide or shoot it
out with police, so we didn't want to go to his home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the buyer's suggestion, Echols showed up at the Flying
J Truck Stop near Shreveport, where authorities arrested him
without any problems.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he maintained he was Robert Byle, but he changed his
story when detectives told him they were going to check his
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he said, `OK. I'm Alan Echols,' '' said DeValkenaere, who
has hunted Echols for years.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Trusty, spokesman for the Caddo Parish Sheriff's Office,
said Echols was wearing a T-shirt and jeans and sported a ``scruffy
beard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been living down here without a hint of trouble since at
least 1994,'' Trusty said. ``As far as we can tell, he didn't do
much illegal down here, other than hide out from the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Trusty said Echols blended with other residents in northwest
Louisiana, a quiet area with many lakes that provide good fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Echols was in a Louisiana jail late Tuesday awaiting extradition
to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Nichols' sister, Denise Goode of Kansas City, praised
police for finally catching Echols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see him one last time,'' she said, ``at
sentencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Peters, a former assistant prosecutor who won the
conviction at trial, said the capture ends the legend of a criminal
who seemed to beat the system.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Cain, Echols' defense lawyer, said he had not heard from
his client since he left. Cain said he assumed Echols went to a
Mexican state that does not extradite U.S. criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Cain added, ``I can't blame the kid (for running); what's he got
to lose?'' Cain said he did not know if Echols' grandparents would
be able to get back the $100,000 bond they lost after he fled eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Circuit Judge K. Preston Dean, who allowed Echols
to remain free after bond was posted, declined to comment.

KANSAS REGULATORS APPROVE TENTATIVE TERMS OF UTILITY MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ The Kansas Corporation Commission on Tuesday outlined a
tentative order that would allow the proposed merger of Western
Resources Inc. and Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co., but would keep
the utilities from charging customers for many merger costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-hour work session with staff members, the three
commissioners agreed that customers of the new utility, Westar
Energy, would not see any merger-related rate increase on their
monthly bills for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   During that moratorium, the utility would keep all savings it
was able to glean from streamlined and consolidated operations,
estimated to be $191 million. After that, ratepayers would receive
all remaining merger savings.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, as expected, rejected more favorable terms for
the utilities that the companies had worked out with the
commission's staff. Under the staff recommendation, the new utility
eventually could have put up to $300 million into its rate base to
cover Western's acquisition premium _ the amount of KCP&AMP;L's sale
price over its book value.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the commissioners said, merger costs would be treated
as an expense and amortized over the 36 years after the moratorium
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Western and KCP&AMP;L said Tuesday that they would have no comment
until the commission's final order was issued, probably in four to
six weeks. Utility officials previously have said that substantial
changes in the staff recommendations on recovering merger costs
could scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also needs approval from Missouri and federal
regulators. The utilities have agreed to terms with those
regulators' staffs and with the agency that represents Missouri
consumers. Under the Missouri agreement, Western will not recover
the acquisition premium from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the order outlined Tuesday, the new utility would file a
Kansas rate case after four years. The resulting order, expected
about eight months later, would determine whether users of
electricity from the utility would see lower bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ray of hope for ratepayers is that savings will be
significant enough at the time of the next rate case that they will
be able to realize the benefits from the merger,'' said Walker
Hendrix, counsel for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned, ``It's not a home run for the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Brian Moline said the agreement was designed to
protect the ratepayers while dealing fairly with the companies'
desire to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what we've done today is coming as close as we can
to balancing those interests,'' Moline said.
</P>
<P>
   The two other commissioners agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very difficult case,'' said Commissioner
Cynthia Claus. ``I'm comfortable we've all considered the evidence
very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairman John Wine said, ``I'm satisfied we've done
all we can with what we've got.''

SALAD BARS:   HOW MUCH E COLI, BACTERIA AND FLIES WILL STATE 
 INSPECTORS ALLOW?

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small child snags a piece of melon from a salad bar
with her chubby little fingers. A man sneezes, then picks up the
tongs resting on a bed of potato salad. A woman runs her finger
along the edge of a tuna salad bowl and puts it in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of help-yourself food bars, there are many more
opportunities for food to be contaminated than at a full service
delicatessen _ and little enforcement of the rules that do exist.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory analysis of seven establishments in Manhattan
selected by the Dining section found far more problems than New
York State records would indicate: not one would have passed a
state inspection. At best, the quality of some of the food tested
was very low because of age, mishandling or contamination. A review
of state inspection records after the testing showed that four of
the seven establishments failed inspections in 1998 or 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There are no regulations that specify how long food can stay on
a salad bar or in a deli display case, and none that prevent food
from being recycled from one day to the next. There are no food
police to prevent people from sticking their fingers into the
dishes. The state oversees food safety in 28,000 supermarkets and
delis _ but it employs only 75 inspectors to do the work. In the
early 1990s, there were 63.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory analysis done for the Dining section found high
levels of bacteria, yeasts or molds in most samples, indicating
that the food had been kept at improper temperatures and for too
long, and that much of it was either spoiled or on the verge of
spoiling.

   ``One of the major concerns is the length of time food is on a
salad bar,'' said Dr. Michael Doyle, the director of the Center for
Food Safety and Quality Enhancement at the University of Georgia.
``Many keep refilling it without washing up the containers.
Sometimes they take the food off the salad bar, replenish it and
refrigerate it overnight, and that gets them in more trouble than
anything because of temperature abuse, which is one of the leading
causes of food-borne disease. That's what frightens me the most.
And who knows where hands have been prior to touching food? I don't
eat at them because of all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dining section's survey is not large enough to be
representative, but it does provide a snapshot of conditions at
places that are among the least and the most expensive. Six were
help-yourself food bars, and one had food displayed in the open
where customers could touch it, although it was packaged by
servers. The cleanliness of the food had nothing to do with the
price.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Groth, a biologist and food safety specialist at
Consumers Union, said that conclusions could not be drawn about the
safety of the food because the sampling was much too small to be
statistically reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``High bacteria count is a quality issue, not a safety issue,''
he added. ``Scientists call it the yuck factor. It's not lethal,
but a big yuck...''
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult to trace the source of gastrointestinal
illnesses. Most food-borne illness is never reported, and neither
New York state nor the federal government keeps records on
help-yourself food. But Dr. Michael Osterholm, a former
epidemiologist for the Minnesota health department, said that
``produce is the No. 1 vehicle for transmission of food-borne
disease over the last decade, and much of that has been associated
with salad bars.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dining section's survey, two food samples were taken
from each of the seven stores: Dean &AMP; DeLuca in SoHo; Eli's, at
Third Avenue and 80th Street; the Food Emporium at Third Avenue and
63d Street; Fresh N' Plus, on Third Avenue between 78th and 79th
Streets; Morton Williams Associated Stores, at Broadway and 57th
Street; Exotic Flower Deli, at 202 Avenue of the Americas, and
Whole Foods, at 117 Prince Street.
</P>
<P>
   The food was tested for the total amount of bacteria (a high
level indicates poor refrigeration or poor manufacturing
practices); for the presence of coliform (a high level indicates
possible contamination from other sources, poor food handling or
improper storage); for yeasts and molds, which are present in
spoiled food; for E. coli, a type of coliform that indicates the
presence of fecal matter; for staphylococcus, a germ that causes an
infection that can lead to death, and for listeria, the bacteria
that causes listeriosis.
</P>
<P>
   There are no regulations for total allowable bacteria in New
York State, only guidelines: five million colony-forming units per
gram for raw food, and one million for cooked food. The guideline
for coliform is 10 parts per million for cooked food.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria levels as high as those are ``a red flag to us,'' said
Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the State Department of Agriculture
and Markets, which is responsible for inspecting supermarkets and
delis. ``It will trigger us to look further, check for pathogens
and see why the product is spoiling.'' The inspectors try to visit
each place once a year, giving the food a visual inspection and
taking the temperature of various dishes.
</P>
<P>
   In each store in the Dining section's survey, one of the two
items sampled had levels of bacteria or coliform that exceeded the
guidelines. Some food also had high levels of yeasts and molds. One
tested positive for staphylococcus (which did not mean that someone
would contract the disease but that the food had been handled by
someone with a staph infection). There were no detectable levels of
E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   The food was bought and tested by Associated Analytical
Laboratories Inc. of Manhattan. Temperatures were taken after
purchase. Then the food was placed in chilled containers and taken
to the laboratory. The state inspection process is the same, except
that the state takes the temperature of the food while it is still
on display.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances the temperature of the hot foods was as much
as 40 degrees below the required temperature, 140 degrees
Fahrenheit, while the cold food was as much as 35 degrees above the
required maximum, 45. Bacteria thrive at around 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Dining section's spot check was far worse
than the state's annual findings, which suggests either that by
chance the section's choices were not as clean or fresh as the food
normally displayed in a vast majority of stores, or that 75
inspectors cannot do a thorough job of inspecting 28,000 places.
Less than 9 percent of those 28,000 failed two consecutive
inspections, said Gregg, who added that the department tries to
inspect each place once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspecting once a year does not adequately deal with the
problems,'' Ms. Kleiner said. ``What I have seen in food
preparation facilities is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors arrive unannounced, with a list of two types of
potential violations: critical deficiencies, which are likely to
cause immediate health problems, and general deficiencies, which
are not deemed immediate health hazards. The temperatures of foods
are tested. Critical deficiencies include the presence of insects
or rodents in the food, the handling of food without gloves, and
the display of food at improper temperatures. Any critical
infraction means a failed inspection; this can result in a fine
that varies depending on how many problems are found and whether
the store has failed its previous inspection. Reinspection follows
within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   If a store fails three inspections, the owner is usually taken
to State Supreme Court. There were about 190 court cases in 1997
and 1998, but the judge ordered only 10 of the stores in each of
those years to close. So far this year there have been 91 court
cases.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Inspection reports on the seven establishments were obtained
from the state after the Dining section's spot check.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven places in the Dining section's survey had
failed inspections in 1998 or 1999 and three paid fines; one, Whole
Foods, had failed twice.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods was inspected in August 1998 and had 3 critical
deficiencies and 14 general ones; it paid $1,200 in fines. Upon
reinspection in October it had 2 critical deficiencies and paid
$1,800 more in fines. By May 1999, it had cleared up all critical
deficiencies but still had 9 general ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the laboratory work done for the Dining section, one dish
from Whole Foods _ cold brussels sprouts _ had extremely high
levels of bacteria, coliform and yeast and tested positive for
staphylococcus. The other item _ hot kale with peppers _ had a high
total bacteria count and very high coliform and yeast counts.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rosenbloom, the owner of Whole Foods, was shocked by the
findings. ``We had to let two of our managers go because they
couldn't pass inspection,'' he said. ``We were concerned we were
going to lose our license. Lately the state has gotten pretty
stringent. The salad bar is exceptionally difficult to control. You
have lots of customers, and hopefully they are not putting their
fingers in it. It's terribly worrisome. If we hadn't passed the May
inspection, we would have had a hearing and the state would have
closed us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would eat from his help-yourself food bar, he said:
``I wouldn't want my grandson eating in a salad bar in this kind of
food service. I will talk to my managers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Morton Williams Associated Stores location at Broadway
and 57th Street, the June 1998 inspection report listed two
critical deficiencies that included dozens of live and dead flies.
At an inspection in November 1998, three critical deficiencies were
found and a $300 fine was levied. The store was inspected again in
March and had no critical deficiencies but a number of general
ones. The latest inspection, last Friday, found no critical
deficiencies and 13 general ones.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Sloan, who owns Morton Williams Associated Stores with
his brother, William, said: ``To highlight our store on a
comparative basis is an injustice. We think we run a first-class,
clean operation. The difference in zealousness between one
inspector and another is 1,000 percent. Inspectors are trying to
make a name for themselves. We spend a lot of money on a clean,
healthy environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 1998 inspection report for Dean &AMP; DeLuca, where the
food is packed by employees but can be touched by customers, listed
four critical deficiencies, including the presence of live roaches
and houseflies on food or food-handling equipment, and 14 general
ones. The company was fined $300. On a follow-up inspection in
October there were no critical deficiencies and 11 general ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as these things come to anyone's attention we try to
keep things up,'' said Emil Grosso, the vice president for finance
at Dean &AMP; DeLuca.
</P>
<P>
   At the Exotic Flower Deli, where one item had high bacteria, the
owner, Jimmy Noh, said he checks the food ``a couple of days a week
with a thermometer,'' and throws away food ``after 2 o'clock when
the temperature is too high outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The high level of bacteria, yeasts and molds in a sample of
chicken salad from the Food Emporium store at Third Avenue and 63d
Street was ``an isolated incident,'' said Cheryl Palmer, the senior
vice president for strategic marketing at the Great Atlantic and
Pacific Tea Company, the chain's owner. She said the company had
been talking to the maker of some salad bar foods about the
products. ``We run our own tests and we have proper procedures in
place and are constantly updating our procedures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, spokesmen for the stores blamed poor help for their
problems. ``People are lazy,'' said Ross Breen, the manager of
Eli's, a sentiment echoed by other store officials. ``They are
always trying to do shortcuts, and that's what gets us in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kleiner, the sanitation consultant, is even more critical.
``They assume people are capable of handling the food and they are
not,'' she said. ``Keeping a place clean starts from the top.''

MOST PREFER IMPROVING PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO VOUCHERS IN NEW SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
  (SEE also SCHOOL-VOUCHERS) 
(nk) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of Americans prefer allowing government
to improve and strengthen public schools rather than giving parents
tuition vouchers for private or church-sponsored schools, according
to a poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted this summer by the Gallup Organization for
Phi Delta Kappa, a professional association of educators, found
that 70 percent of respondents favored the government's improving
public schools, while 28 percent preferred vouchers. The poll has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also suggested that the very word ``vouchers'' is
politically loaded. When asked specifically about vouchers to pay
for all of the tuition, 47 percent of respondents were in favor and
48 were opposed. Last year, 48 percent were in favor and 46 percent
were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time since the poll began addressing the issue
in 1993 that ``vouchers'' was introduced into the questions to
reflect the growing trend of using government-issued notes to pay
for tuition at private or church-sponsored schools. The first time
was last year.
</P>
<P>
   The use of vouchers has inspired considerable political and
legal controversy, especially in church-related schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics argue that issuing vouchers for religious schools
violates the separation of church and state. Proponents say public
schools will benefit from the competition, which will also serve
poor students by enabling them to attend schools with higher
standards.
</P>
<P>
   A small majority of Americans continues to favor allowing
parents to send their children to any public, private or
church-related school if government pays all or part of the
tuition. Fifty-one percent of respondents favored the voucher
concept and 47 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The latter findings represent a slight increase in opposition to
vouchers over last year, when 51 percent were in favor and 45
percent were opposed. The figures represent a reversal of opinion
since 1996, when 43 percent favored vouchers and 54 percent opposed
them. In 1997 the results were almost evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found divisions among Americans on the issue of
tuition tax credits. The public more strongly supports _ by 57
percent to 47 percent _ partial tuition credits over full tuition
tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The public showed strong support for providing public school
services to children who are schooled at home. Ninety-two percent
favored providing special education services; 80 percent supported
allowing home-schooling teachers to take part in public school
teacher development activities; 74 percent supported allowing
home-schooled students to participate in public school
extracurricular activities. But most expressed a strong desire to
see the students adhere to the same standards as public school
students.

JOB INTERVIEWS AREN'T THE PLACE TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A job interview is not the place for politics. Or religion. Or
dirty jokes. Or racial or sexist rantings.
</P>
<P>
   Duh, you say?
</P>
<P>
   You'd be surprised. At careers fairs and in conversations with
job hunters, it's disappointing to find so many individuals who
don't understand that, no matter how much they hate President
Clinton, it's not the time or place to pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping personal opinions private is paramount in job
interviews. The same caution should be exercised when attending
professional association meetings or talking informally to people
at potential places of employment.
</P>
<P>
   I've written before about the problems caused by politically
charged conversations in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to discuss politics and feel no reason to reveal
my views to someone I barely know, so I keep quiet,'' said one
Kansas City area worker who had to share a cubicle with an
opinionated blatherer. ``However, if I don't openly disagree with
the person, he assumes I do agree and continues on, which makes me
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Transfer that kind of reaction into a setting where a job
applicant is trying to make a good impression. The discomfort is
magnified. The interviewer _ or even the friend who's being asked
to make a job referral _ is likely to recoil from recommending
spewers of dogma or sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Inappropriate rantings aren't limited to touchy politics. I once
tried to cut short (with no success) a job hunter who apparently
thought I wanted to hear about the potholes in his street. I don't
like potholes, either, but a high-tech job fair isn't the place for
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of thinking, ``Here's a smart, qualified job
candidate,'' I was thinking, ``There's no way in the world I'd want
that guy in my department.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal opinions about politics, race, religion, gender or
sexual orientation have little bearing on job competence. It's wise
to keep those views, whatever they are, private when looking for
work.

EDITORIAL: BACK FROM THE BRINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 25:
</P>
<P>
   This has been a positive summer for several bird and animal
species that human carelessness had once driven to the brink. In
July the Interior Department disclosed its intention to remove the
bald eagle and the Aleutian Canada goose from the
endangered-species list, pending a brief period of public comment.
Last Friday the department formally removed the peregrine falcon
from the list. One day later the White House announced that it had
secured 9,300 acres of land adjacent to Yellowstone National Park
to provide critical winter range for the park's fragile bison herd,
which has been alternately ravaged by starvation and the animosity
of Montana's cattle ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   This good news sends a timely and important message to a
Congress that has often been indifferent to the needs of nature.
The message is that recovery programs can work, and that it would
be foolish to deny the funds that make these triumphs possible.
</P>
<P>
   The peregrine falcon is only the sixth species to warrant
de-listing since the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973,
leaving about 1,200 plant and animal species on the list. In 1970
only 39 breeding pairs existed in the entire country. There are now
more than 1,650 pairs. The bird's recovery owes much to the late
Rachel Carson, who first drew attention to the dangers of DDT and
to the subsequent passage in 1972 of a federal law banning the
pesticide. But credit is also due the Endangered Species Act, which
enabled the federal government to intervene vigorously on the
bird's behalf, breeding falcons in captivity and protecting habitat
where they could flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's beleaguered bison are not officially listed as
endangered, but they are clearly in trouble. In harsh winters, the
bison descend from Yellowstone's high plateau and wander peaceably
across park boundaries in search of food. But because some bison
carry a disease called brucellosis, which is potentially dangerous
to cattle, they are routinely shot or captured for slaughter by
state agents, largely at the behest of Montana's cattle ranchers.
In 1997 the Montana Department of Livestock killed 1,000 bison,
nearly one-third of Yellowstone's herd _ even though nobody stopped
to ask which animals were carrying the disease, and even though
there have been no documented cases of the disease ever jumping
from bison to cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The federal purchase from private owners of 9,300 acres adjacent
to the park _ made possible by $13 million from the Federal Land
and Water Conservation Fund _ will give the animals what amounts to
a safety valve, a big piece of land where they can forage for food
without fear of being shot. It is only the first step in what must
be a broader effort to reconcile the needs of the bison and the
ranchers. But even this small gesture would not have happened
without the negotiating skills of local conservation groups like
the Greater Yellowstone Coalition and pressure from Montana's Sen.
Max Baucus and the Clinton administration to extract the necessary
funds from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many in Congress have yet to see the value of the
very federal programs that have helped the falcon and the bison.
President Clinton's request for a modest $80 million for innovative
public-private partnerships to preserve habitat for endangered
species has been slashed by 80 percent by House and Senate
appropriations committees. Likewise, congressional appropriators
have cut his $1 billion request for the Land and Water Conservation
Fund and other open-space initiatives by two-thirds. A more
generous Congress could guarantee more success stories in the years
ahead.

AGREEMENT ON MISSOURI RIVER FLOW MAY BE NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The eight states in the Missouri River basin
_ which for years have fought over the river's flow, especially in
times of drought _ may be close to agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're near a historic consensus,'' said Richard Opper,
executive director of the Missouri River Basin Association, who has
worked for several months to achieve an agreement among the states
and a group of American Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues being considered is an agreed-upon water level
if a drought similar to that of the 1980s reoccurred, Opper said.
</P>
<P>
   The group may also propose that the river between Fort Peck and
Gavins Point dams _ about 188 miles in Montana and South Dakota _
be allowed to rise in spring, as unmanaged rivers do, and be
monitored for its impacts on fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri River, in its 2,500-mile cut through the Plains to
the Mississippi River, has for years spawned more fury than
concord. And this new effort for consensus may still have farther
to go.
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri official involved in the negotiations cautioned
Tuesday that the states have not agreed on all crucial issues. A
final agreement may not be completed until Monday, when the
association meets in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This battle over the Missouri's flow has continued more than a
decade as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has reconsidered how it
operates the flow out of six upstream dams.
</P>
<P>
   The corps began in 1989 to study how to regulate the flow, when
it attempted to revise its master control manual. Five years later,
it made its proposal, but was met with so much criticism that it
withdrew its plan and start anew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the basin association's board _ which consists of
representatives of the eight basin states, each appointed by the
governor, and a group that represents nearly 30 American Indian
tribes _ hopes to reach consensus by next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations will be forwarded to the Corps of Engineers,
which will choose in early September a new operating plan for
managing the flows each year. The plan won't be revealed until
October, the corps said.
</P>
<P>
   Opper and corps officials said Tuesday that it appeared likely
that consensus, at least among the eight states, was possible,
despite years of conflict. Further negotiations with the Indian
tribes may be required.
</P>
<P>
   Getting eight states to agree is an achievement, Opper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked very, very hard on this,'' Opper said. ``And
there's been a lot of movement. When we first started on this, we
were millions of acre-feet apart. Now, the differences are largely
insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   The basin association is also proposing a new biological
monitoring program and the establishment of an endangered species
recovery team. It may also push for more flexibility for the corps
to experiment or change its operations to accommodate endangered
species and other interests.
</P>
<P>
   Such recommendations, if agreed to by all the states, would have
great influence with the corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus of eight governors will weigh heavily,'' said
Rosemary Hargraves, project manager for the corps master manual
revision.
</P>
<P>
   Hargraves stressed that the corps will consider the positions of
other interests in the basin, including environmental groups that
are pushing for dramatic changes in the river's flow.
</P>
<P>
   American Rivers, a national conservation group that has pushed
for an end to navigation on the lower Missouri, has begun a drive
for a Missouri River management plan that would split the
navigation season on the lower river. A split season would provide
enough flow for barge traffic in spring and fall, but not in
summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Democrat,
the corps has modeled the split navigation season in three ways,
Hargraves said.
</P>
<P>
   A split season ``is obviously the best choice for the Missouri's
fish and wildlife,'' said Chad Smith, who leads American Rivers'
Missouri River campaign. ``But it's also the best people
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Navigation interests on the lower Missouri have long opposed a
split navigation season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just have to close up shop,'' said John Madgett, senior
vice president of Mid-West Terminal Warehouse Co., which operates
the largest river facility in the Kansas City reach of the
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river would be just a wild, wild river, never again to be
seen by you or I,'' Madgett continued. ``But I don't think that
will come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Madgett said he had seen Missouri officials make concessions to
try to reach agreement with upper basin states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting to see how the states have shown
interest in trying to cooperate,'' Madgett said. ``For years,
they've fought and done things behind each other's backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all agree to something, and there's going to be people
who are not going to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kucera, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' deputy
director of policy, said he still had questions for the corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to agree to anything yet,'' Kucera said.
``We're still a ways from agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   A key issue will be how to address environmental issues related
to the river's management, Kucera said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has maintained that allowing
a spring rise could help threatened and endangered fish and
wildlife, as their reproductive cycles are tied to the natural
spring rise.
</P>
<P>
   Hargraves said it's unclear which of the natural disruptions of
the river has a greater impact on endangered species. For example,
does the loss of a spring rise have a greater impact than the
dramatic loss of fish and wildlife habitat?
</P>
<P>
   To get some answers, Hargraves said, the corps has asked the
National Academy of Sciences to conduct a two- to three-year study
on the status of scientific knowledge on fish and wildlife issues
on the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the corps has increased its efforts to restore
habitat for fish and wildlife along the river. Hargraves hopes
those efforts, combined with other recent efforts to restore
habitat, will help the corps weather any challenges to its new plan
as being neglectful of endangered species.
</P>

 BUSINESS TRAVEL: CROWDED PLANES; AIRLINE UPDATE; WILL CARNIVAL BUY
PRINCESS?  (Duplication warning: also moving in ``f'' category) 
(mk)

<P>
   If you wonder whether the flights you have been on in recent
months are always crowded, or whether you are just a victim of bad
timing or bad luck, the load factors _ the percentages of available
seats occupied by paying passengers _ for most U.S. airlines last
month are revealing. So are the year-to-date load factors.
</P>
<P>
   Every major carrier had load factors at least in the 70s in
July, and most had them in the mid- to high-70s. Two airlines,
Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, had them in the 80s
that month; TWA's 2.4 million domestic passengers resulted in what
the airlines said was its ``best month in modern history'' for
domestic boardings.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines also broke records in July. The 79.1 percent load
factor at Delta Air Lines, for example, was the highest for any
month in its 70-year history, while the 77.8 percent at Continental
Airlines was not only the highest of any July in its history, but
its second-highest month ever.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you can easily get an overnight ``red eye''
flight or a Saturday flight, both of which used to be readily
available because few business travelers flew then. Now they have
to fly when there are seats. On several recent Saturdays, for
example, occupancies on Delta flights have averaged above 80
percent, and on a recent Saturday reached 86.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has driven people to what used to be underused
flights, because those fares tend to be cheaper and passengers are
willing to fly at those times for a bargain price,'' said John
Kennedy, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The only two major airlines whose year-to-date passenger loads
were below 70 percent are America West at 67.4 percent and Alaska
Airlines at 62.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The annual average load factors hovered in the high-50s and
low-60s throughout the 1980s. In 1994 they rose to 69.3 percent and
thereafter began their ascent into the 70s, where they remain
today. What this means, of course, is that packed airplanes are not
just the result of the luck of the draw but a permanent condition
for most passengers, at least until the economy weakens.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Airlines
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who joins the British Airways frequent-flier program and
then takes a trans-Atlantic flight on a full-fare business-class
round-trip ticket, or two one-way tickets (either way, the cost is
$5,366 between New York or Newark and London), will receive two
free coach tickets to almost anywhere in the world. Now for the
fine print: Passengers must travel by Dec. 15, 1999, and no later
than Dec. 31, 1999, and they also must write a note, letter or
treatise expressing their opinion of British Airways' business
class. The free tickets are valid for travel between Jan. 15, 2000,
and Dec. 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Airtran is the latest airline to offer 10 percent discounts for
travel booked over its site on the Internet (www.airtran.com).
Airtran's hub is in Atlanta and its destinations include Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.; Miami; New Orleans; Orlando, Fla.; Savannah, Ga.,
and Tampa, Fla. Fares require at least a three-day advance
purchase, but do not require a round-trip purchase or Saturday
night stay.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next February, Aloha Airlines will fly from Hawaii to
the mainland for the first time in its 53-year history. Using new
Boeing 737-300s, it will fly two daily round trips _ between
Honolulu and Oakland, Calif., and Maui and Oakland. If customers
find on-time performance, baggage handling or customer service
lacking, Aloha said it would give them a free one-way inter-island
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery Deal
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are not all convinced that Carnival Corp. will succeed
in buying Princess Cruises, but neither do they think it is a pipe
dream, especially since Carnival confirmed that it had held talks
with Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co., Princess'
British owner. On Tuesday, Tim Gallagher, a Carnival spokesman,
said that the talks had occurred ``earlier this year,'' adding that
there were no talks currently and the company had no comment on
whether it had made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Princess expects delivery of seven new ships between next year
and 2004, and that hardly seems like the action of a company
wanting to sell. On the other hand, when Carnival speaks, much of
the cruise industry rejoices or trembles. Its 35 percent market
share is far and away the largest, as is its fleet of more than 44
ships, with nine on order. Princess, by contrast, has a 15.5
percent market share and nine ships plus the seven on order. And a
British newspaper, The Daily Mail, reported that Carnival offered
$11 billion for Princess.
</P>
<P>
   If Carnival does buy Princess, within three years it is likely
to command at least 50 percent of the worldwide cruise market. If
it does not, Carnival still has come a long way since its inception
in 1972. It acquired its first ship _ the Empress of Canada _ from
Canadian Pacific for $5 million. Renamed the Mardi Gras, it
promptly ran aground on its maiden voyage from the Port of Miami.

INJURIES HOLD BACK UCLA'S HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No member of UCLA's prized 1998 recruiting class
was more celebrated than cornerback Lovell Houston _ not guard Mike
Saffer, not defensive tackle Ken Kocher, not even tailback prodigy
DeShaun Foster. Houston was a USA Today and Parade Magazine
first-team All-American and he turned down Florida State to play
for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons later, Foster, Kocher and Saffer are starting, while
Houston has little chance of entering the lineup. His trouble has
nothing to do with talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovell is like a freshman who just reported again because he's
missed so much time with the injuries,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston missed training camp last year because of a strained
thigh. He redshirted, then had surgery on both shoulders to repair
high school injuries. He worked diligently in the offseason to
regain strength and flexibility, and when practice began Aug. 14,
Houston figured he'd join the rotation. After all, UCLA had
suspended two starters (Ryan Roques and Marques Anderson) and was
desperate for cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Houston reinjured his left thigh and the
frustration began anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to play, not be a training room trophy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who had a 3.6 grade-point average at Denver's Jefferson
High, has channeled his football frustration into academic
performance. He'll probably major in political science, but he
loves unusual subjects. He took an astronomy class on the nature of
the universe, a political theory class on anarchy and the
Federalist Papers, and a history class on African-American
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's often a separation between American history and black
history,'' he said. ``But the truth is, black history in the United
States is American history. The class opened a lot of gateways for
a multitude of students.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Houston is concentrating on his strained left
thigh. The daily medical report lists him as day-to-day, but his
angst compounds by the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can play,'' he said. ``But to get to the point where
I'm actually on the field, I'll have to take the long road.''
</P>
<P>
   Parking-placard update: Fullback Durell Price and guard Jim
Ghezzi will be arraigned today in L.A. Municipal Court for their
part in the disabled parking scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set our mind to getting the same (punishment) as
everyone else,'' Price said, referring to the $1,485 fine and 200
hours of community service that nine players received at the July
28 arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruins Craig Walendy, DuVal Hicks and Mark Reynosa also
will be arraigned.
</P>
<P>
   Heartache: Junior tackle Brian Polak was a Bishop Amat teammate
of Paul Reyna, the Boise State freshman who died Monday from head
injuries suffered last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about it, my heart sunk,'' said Polak, who
comes from Hacienda Heights. ``I've been thinking of him
constantly....
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him at a San Gabriel Valley all-star game this summer. I
told him to work hard, but when he came down here, I'd kick his
butt.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA plays Boise State on Sept. 4 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, 19, suffered a torn blood vessel between his brain and
skull, and the bleeding developed into a blood clot.

NORTHRIDGE COACHES CAREFUL WITH ABDUL-MALIK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge coaches don't want to take any chance with
Hassan Abdul-Malik.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how important Abdul-Malik is to the Matadors' secondary:
He remains the starting free safety even though he's missed the
last week of practice with a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have him back for the first game,'' defensive
coordinator Foster Andersen said, ``but I want to have him for the
second game. We are being very, very careful with him.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN opens the season Sept. 4 at home against Western Oregon.
The Matadors play the next week at Kansas. Abdul-Malik, who earned
the starting job after an excellent spring, said he's growing
frustrated. He hurt his right leg on Aug. 16, the third day of
practice for the returners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel guilty,'' he said. ``There's a lot of good competition
out there. It's hard to miss practice and the new defensive
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   His role is even more important because Jeremy Golden, last
year's leading tackler, is academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can do what (Golden) did last year, I'll do all right,''
Abdul-Malik said.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking news: Junior offensive lineman Ernie Fierro received
sad news Monday when he found out Boise State defensive lineman
Paul Reyna died four days after suffering a brain injury in the
team's first fall practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fierro and Reyna were teammates at Bishop Amat four years ago
and they have been friends for almost a decade. Fierro's younger
sister graduated with Reyna in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' Fierro said Tuesday. ``I saw him a week
before he left (for Boise). I got a call at (midnight) the night
before last saying he had taken a turn for the worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fierro plans on attending Reyna's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a friend of mine, not just someone I knew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar face: Mike Ogas is back on the Matadors' practice field
as a volunteer assistant coach. Ogas, who caught 40 passes for CSUN
last year as a senior, signed as an undrafted free agent with the
St. Louis Rams in April. He was cut after one minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had six practices and about 100 meetings,'' Ogas said. ``I
got to play pool with Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce. I also
learned about a million things that I can help teach these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Good news, better news: Getting a key signature Monday afternoon
helped Kaleon Green further his bid for a sixth year of eligibility
from the NCAA. He obtained a signed letter from a Kaiser Permanente
doctor who confirmed Green was advised not to play football in 1995
when he was showing symptoms of recurrence of cancer he had the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was supposed to be faxed to the NCAA on Tuesday, and
Green is confident he'll find out he'll be eligible for the
upcoming season by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Sean Atkins won his case with the NCAA on Monday
to sit out just one year instead of the usual two because he
transferred within the Big Sky Conference. He started practicing
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, who played at San Fernando High, went to Sacramento
State last year but didn't receive any scholarship money from the
school until the spring. He'll be eligible to play next year.

 &HT;    Spurs will audition for small forward
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The San Antonio Spurs have more candidates at
small forward than the Republicans have for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Republicans, the Spurs do not have a
front-runner. Unable to find a replacement for Sean Elliott, the
Spurs might give half the team a shot at the position when training
camp begins Oct. 2. Elliott underwent a kidney transplant and was
released from the hospital Tuesday but is unlikely to play this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be (small forward) by committee,'' said R.C.
Buford, assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have all but given up hope of signing Utah's Shandon
Anderson, the most coveted free agent available this year who can
play small forward. The Spurs say that, for whatever reason,
Anderson's agent, Dan Fegan, has kept them at a distance from his
client. Fegan has not returned phone calls to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected trade or a change of heart by Anderson,
here are the Spurs' candidates:
</P>
<P>
   _Malik Rose. Buford said Rose, a 6-foot 7-inch, 250-pound backup
to Tim Duncan at power forward last season, has the quickness and
aggressiveness to play small forward on defense. Rose, however, is
neither an adept ballhandler nor a reliable shooter. This move has
turnover written all over it. ``Maybe we won't let him dribble,''
Buford said, joking. ``But he can post up smaller players.''
</P>
<P>
   _Mario Elie. A small forward during most of his five seasons
with Houston, the 6-5 Elie moved to shooting guard in San Antonio.
Elie lacks Elliott's quickness, but few are more tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   _Jaren Jackson. Primarily a shooting guard, the 6-6 Jackson has
played some small forward. Jackson shoots much better than Rose but
lacks ballhandling and passing skills.
</P>
<P>
   _Jerome Kersey. Too slow to work significant minutes at small
forward, Kersey filled in last season primarily against bulky
players like himself.
</P>
<P>
   _Tim Duncan. As a rookie two seasons ago, the 7-foot Duncan,
normally a power forward and center, played small forward for short
periods in a lineup that included the 7-1 David Robinson and 7-foot
Will Perdue. The Spurs did not use that lineup during their recent
NBA championship season, having improved their depth on the
perimeter when Elliott returned from a knee injury and Elie and
Kersey joined the team. Coach Gregg Popovich has considered going
back to the ``three bigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perdue, a free agent, has yet to re-sign, but the Spurs say they
are close to completing a deal with him. Meanwhile, they are
talking to Samaki Walker, a 6-9 free agent power forward for
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   _Chucky Brown. The Spurs are considering making an offer to
Brown, a free agent who played for Charlotte last season. The 6-8
Brown averaged 25 minutes and 8.5 points per game last season,
converting 37.5 percent of his three-point shots, playing primarily
small forward.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Bexar County commissioners approved an agreement Tuesday
with the Spurs for a $175 million tax-funded arena and called a
Nov. 2 vote on the issue.
</P>

Texas.

COMMENTARY: KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 4th graf, 2nd sentence, beginning `How could such
graphic...')  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I will never forget the shock of hearing dirty
talk in the Senate for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A pubic hair on a Coke can ... Long Dong Silver ... bestiality
movies.
</P>
<P>
   I looked around the Senate Judiciary hearing room. Jaws were
slack, if not dropping.
</P>
<P>
   The stricken senators listening to Anita Hill on that October
day in 1991 looked as if they wanted to dive under the green felt
skirts of the dais, or stick bags over their heads. How could such
graphic sexual language dare crack that marble dignity, in the same
room where Congress investigated the sinking of the Titanic, the
bombing of Pearl Harbor, Watergate and Iran-Contra, and where Joe
Welch once demanded of Joe McCarthy, ``Have you no sense of
decency, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   Decency blushed during the Thomas-Hill hearings. There was a
sense that weekend that the scalding spectacle would not end until
one of the combatants was fatally gored.
</P>
<P>
   So it was again in the bitter contest between Ken Starr and Bill
Clinton, when Senate dirty talk made Thomas-Hill look like Disney.
By the time they got to the 1998 sex scandal, the Democrats were
wiser and meaner. They applied the ruthless, truthless lessons they
had learned watching Republicans in the Thomas hearings: Save your
guy at any cost. Only the appearance of the Gap dress interrupted
the Clintonite whispers that, as the Republicans once said of
Anita, Monica was an erotomaniac, a little nutty and a little
slutty.
</P>
<P>
   After the wild ride of the Clinton years, what shocked us in
1991 is no longer shocking enough. ``Strange Justice,'' the new
Showtime movie recreating the Thomas-Hill imbroglio that premiered
in Hollywood Tuesday night (based on the book by my friends Jane
Mayer and Jill Abramson, a New York Times editor) has goosed up the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The docudrama or adaptation _ cutting and pasting history and
fiction, real news clips and interpretive dramatizations _ features
a bizarre scene in which Clarence Thomas, played by Delroy Lindo,
rips off his shirt during his Senate testimony and prances around
half-naked and barefoot. When he utters his famous ``high-tech
lynching'' line, Lindo uses his tie as a noose.
</P>
<P>
   The prim and stoic Anita Hill, played by Regina Taylor, is given
more ratings oomph here _ with flashes of anger and trails of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors tried to give three-dimensional portraits of these
icons,'' said Jacob Epstein, the screenwriter and executive
producer. ``They may not have been representational portraits. They
were figurative and impressionistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reviews have praised the movie's edgy style, not
minding the imaginary flourishes that the film makers ``cooked
up,'' as Epstein put it.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch both bought the rights to the book
first and both chickened out of making the movie. Turner must not
have wanted to risk offending a Supreme Court justice. Murdoch, a
Thomas friend, killed the project as it was going into production.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime has won praise for daring to take on such a provocative
subject. And the movie convincingly portrays the Biden committee's
failure to call two other key witnesses who could have offered
evidence corroborating Ms. Hill, and the Bush White House's slick
packaging of an inexperienced judge.
</P>
<P>
   But it evades the truly ulcerous issue: One of these two people
told a monumental lie and got away with it. Showtime takes the easy
way, making the villain the cynical Washington process. Clarence
and Anita are merely two dignified people used by spin doctors and
partisan interests.
</P>
<P>
   With Rene Russo in ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' and the law vamps
on ``Ally McBeal'' exploiting sex for professional advantage,
feminine wiles are in fashion again. ``Strange Justice'' fits this
mood, treating sexual misconduct in the office as no-fault
behavior, a matter of Rashomon.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, during his grand jury testimony, volunteered that
although it seemed irrational, Thomas and Ms. Hill ``both thought
they were telling the truth ... you're dealing with, in some ways,
the most mysterious area of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a Bill &AMP; Monica movie in the works. We can
only hope that the actor playing the president keeps his shirt on.

THE VERY DETERMINED MEET THE DEARLY DEPARTED

 (ATTN: Maine)  (js) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NORTHPORT, Maine _ By Ernest Van Den Bossche's count, 18,000
guests have visited his Temple Heights Spiritual Camp this summer.
The lodge is empty and the parking lot barren, however, because
most of the guests are dead.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Van Den Bossche, Temple Heights' genial
president, stood on its porch overlooking Penobscot Bay and
explained his estimate: since June, 3,000 people have come to the
camp, in this town near Bangor, to consult the spiritual mediums in
residence, and an average of five or six souls have been summoned
per reading.
</P>
<P>
   Though a camp for conversing with spirits may seem an unlikely
feature of the rugged backwoods, on a per-capita basis Maine is
actually a leading state in the number of organizations for
mediums, according to the National Spiritualist Association of
Churches. The two-building Temple Heights Spiritual Camp, more than
a century old, may help to explain this: it attracts spirit-seekers
from as far away as England and New Zealand, and mediums, up to
three a week, from Canada, Indiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crush of souls, a few members of the volunteer staff
relaxed in deck chairs the other day while Van Den Bossche
expounded on the calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All spirits are available to be tapped into,'' he said, ``if
they're in the realm where they can make contact with the earth
plane, or if they're not off on important business in other parts
of the universe. But it works through the vibration of being asked.
I am not in contact with all these spirits all the time, because
otherwise I'd be out of my tree.''
</P>
<P>
   This ability to compartmentalize, a favorite coping mechanism on
earth, is essential at this tidy camp, which Van Den Bossche walks
with crutches because of polio. Before readings, the living must
explicitly consent to having their spirits explored. Reading
people's energy without consent _ ``psychic snooping'' _ is
strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The camp was founded in 1882 by Dr. Benjamin Colson, a spiritual
healer and herbalist who received the $4,000 and 100 acres to get
it started from Maine's governor, Frederick Robie, whose ailing
daughter Colson had cured through homeopathic methods.
</P>
<P>
   Today the camp offers private readings ($25 each), group
``message circles'' and spiritualist services in a modest chapel.
Sunflowers _ the emblem of spiritualism because they turn toward
the sun, the way a spiritualist claims to turn toward the light of
truth, revelation and the spirit _ are placed throughout the
low-ceilinged rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Modern spiritualism, the belief that human souls live on to
relay God's messages, began in 1848 in upstate Hydesville, N.Y.,
where a pair of teen-age sisters, Margaret and Kate Fox, claimed to
be communicating with unseen forces through otherwise inexplicable
rappings on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   A visiting reporter submitted to a reading, held in a pleasant
room overlooking the bay, at a table covered by a lace doily.
Malcolm Spears, a medium with a Santa Claus physique and a red
beard, closed his eyes. Charms and crystals hung from his neck by a
cord. After saying a prayer, and having the visitor speak her name
three times to insure consent, Spears jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   There were freedom issues. Some claustrophobia. Guilt coming
through the family and a recent revisiting of priorities, including
how to balance friends and work.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the visitor crossed her arms impatiently, wanting
specifics, Spears, who works part time as a shipper for a
pharmaceutical company, said promptly, ``I ask you not to do that,
because it cuts me off.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears, who reads the energy of objects, a study called
psychometry, then asked the visitor to hand over her rings. Closing
his eyes more tightly, he weighed them in his meaty palm. They held
loss and betrayal, he said, and produced images of people turning
their backs. There was a kitchen where someone who should have been
there was missing.
</P>
<P>
   The spirits, it seemed, were queuing up.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The strongest presence was that of an older man, who had either
a mustache or dentures, knew the visitor when she was 9 and wanted
to give advice, Spears said. ``Does that ring a bell?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   It rang no bells. A total stranger, it seemed, had traipsed into
the reading.
</P>
<P>
   But Shirley Carroll found absolute proof of the continuity of
life. Her husband died in January, and so the 67-year-old Mrs.
Carroll had come over from North Jay, Maine, to find out what he
had been doing since he ``passed over.''
</P>
<P>
   And she got answers. Van Den Bossche did her reading and,
without prompting, found her husband in Korea, ``helping out,''
Mrs. Carroll recalled later. Astonished, she said that her husband
had been a prisoner of war in Korea and that she had never told
anyone about that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Van Den Bossche said that he saw this man having
trouble with his tractor. Mrs. Carroll said that her husband had
often had to clean mice from his tractor and that it had frequently
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew about it,'' Mrs. Carroll said, reveling in Van Den
Bossche's omniscience. ``He knew it. He told about it, the tractor,
so I would know who it was who was coming through to him. It was my
husband.''

PATAKI USED VAGARIES OF PAC LAWS TO PROMOTE PRESIDENTIAL HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George Pataki's two political action
committees, one in New York and one in Virginia, were established
in January to promote what he called a ``positive message of
change'' by helping like-minded Republicans win office around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But their reports show that the Pataki PACs used the vagaries of
Virginia and federal election law to put corporate money and large
individual donations behind Pataki's brief hopes for the
presidential nomination. Many other politicians have taken similar
advantage of the laws. Here is how things worked in Pataki's case.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate funds and individual contributions of more than $5,000
to a federal political action committee are barred under federal
law. One of Pataki's committees is covered under federal law. But
the other, organized in Virginia, is subject to its much looser
laws. In Virginia, there are no limits on the size or sources of
contributions to PACs. So the Virginia committee raised $395,300
through June 30, while the federal PAC raised only $185,702.
</P>
<P>
   The federal version of the Pataki PAC announced that it planned
to give 75 percent of its donations to state (as opposed to
federal) candidates. That stipulation allowed it to take money from
the fatter Virginia PAC for 75 percent of its ``expenses,'' a word
that political figures tend to define quite flexibly.
</P>
<P>
   The promise to donate to state candidates in turn enabled Pataki
to use the Virginia-raised money for any political expense he
chose, including the costs of pursuing his own presidential
ambitions. Now that he is no longer pursuing that goal, he can use
the money for anything else he wants.
</P>
<P>
   But the commitment to state candidates meant that Bell
Atlantic's $50,000 in corporate funds helped pay the bills when
Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for Presidents Reagan and Bush, sat
down with Pataki last winter and discussed several speeches that he
wanted to give. She was paid $10,000, and 75 percent of that came
through the Virginia PAC.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute
in Washington, was paid $15,000 last winter to work with Pataki on
a tax-cutting plan. The governor proposed it at the Detroit
Economic Club on June 24, one month after he had abandoned his own
presidential ambitions and endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
for the Republican nomination. Of that sum, $11,250 came through
the Virginia PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The same formula was used to pay at least $10,115 for the
governor's travel bills, and $2,617 to reimburse his communications
director, Zenia Mucha, for travel and phone costs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal PAC's promised contributions to candidates for state
office, which opened the door to transferring money from one PAC to
another, have not materialized. So far, Pataki's federal PAC has
given nothing to state candidates. But Adam Stoll, who runs the
political action committee in New York City, said both PACs may
``quite possibly'' make further donations this year. The Virginia
PAC has given $31,600 to nine Republican legislative candidates in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's light regulatory touch has won it the nickname ``the
Cayman Islands of campaign finance,'' and Pataki is hardly the
first out-of-state politician to discover its uses. Two Republican
presidential hopefuls, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, both moved more than a million
dollars in the last several months through Virginia PACs to aid
their campaigns. And Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority
leader, has established a PAC, the New Republican Majority Fund, in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are such practices legal in Virginia, they also do not
come close to violating federal election laws, under which ``soft
money'' of the sort collected in Virginia plays an increasing role.
</P>
<P>
   The only illegal contributions shown in the Pataki PAC reports
were two contributions of $12,500 each to the federal PAC in New
York City from Reba White Williams, a Republican candidate for the
New York City Council, and her husband, David Williams, head of
Alliance Capital Management, a mutual funds company. The donations
violated the law because they exceeded the $5,000 limit on
contributions to federal PACs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pataki camp will hold on to those contributions anyway.
Stoll said those contributions would become legitimate when $7,500
from each of them was transferred from the federal PAC to the
non-federal PAC in Virginia.

GOODYKOONTZ: FALL TV IS HARD TO STOM ACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never let it be said there's nothing new under the television
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Each fall season brings with it a raft of new shows brimming
with the promise of hope, the joy of discovery, the sight of people
puking on each other, and the threat of eating dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sorry. Those last two apply only to ``this'' fall season.
</P>
<P>
   They may seem like unlikely trends, but at least five new shows
include eruptive nausea; characters in two others threaten to eat
the canine pets of other characters.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just in the pilot episodes. It could be a long,
sloppy season. Though the potential for Pepto-Bismol advertising
seems limitless.
</P>
<P>
   The vomiting is almost always captured in living color, complete
with retching sounds. The dog-eating, thankfully, remains only a
threat. Which means the upchucking is never actually caused by
gobbling up Fido. But it's early yet.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think this is a pathetic cry for attention from
struggling young writers and producers, know that the rich and
famous are in on the act as well. Chris Carter, the creator of
``The X-Files,'' penned the pilot for the Fox network's ``Harsh
Realm,'' about a soldier trapped inside a virtual war game.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbes, the soldier, finds a dog while trying to escape this
alternate reality. He enlists the help of Pinocchio, another
soldier trapped in Harsh Realm. Pinocchio is reluctant to help
Hobbes, and more than once threatens to eat his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The sensible viewer may ask: Why?
</P>
<P>
   `I wanted to distinguish the Pinocchio and Hobbes characters
from one another,'' Carter said earlier this summer. ``I wanted
(Hobbes) to be a very sort of saucy character, who I felt is an
idealized hero who doesn't want men speaking poorly to women, who
would always be chivalrous and gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want Pinocchio to sound different, and to be a
character of some dangerous consequence. And I think that's why you
have a place like Harsh Realm where things like animals are
commodities, and might, in fact, be eaten if let off their leash.''
</P>
<P>
   (Yes, Carter really talks that way. And you wondered why ``The
X-Files'' is so hard to follow sometimes.)
</P>
<P>
   The other threatened dog-munching occurs in ``Get Real,''
another new Fox show. Kenny, a high-school freshman, is threatened
by a bully who promises to beat him up and then, yes, eat his dog.
</P>
<P>
   Woof.
</P>
<P>
   As for vomiting, well, take your pick. In ``Action,'' Fox's
much-talked-about new comedy, producer Peter Dragon gets the
box-office numbers for his latest movie and pukes.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley, of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' fame,
jumps on the blow-chunks bandwagon with his new ABC show
``Snoops,'' in which a queasy private detective riding in the back
seat of a car during a high-speed chase lets go with lunch out the
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester Prep,'' yet another new Fox show, gets in on the
puke parade when a geeky freshman girl downs too many Long Island
Iced Teas, but doesn't keep them down for long.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Third Watch,'' a new NBC show about cops and emergency
medical technicians and the like, we are treated to not one but two
intestinal events. First, a drunk throws up on a rookie cop. Then a
teenage junkie tosses her dinner. The hat trick is threatened
several times, but never comes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in ``The Badland,'' another new Fox show (is anyone
surprised that so many of these disgusting scenes take place on the
network that once whelped ``Married With Children'', yet another
drunk pukes on yet another rookie cop.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the same cop, Ryan Caulfield, is involved in a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you doin'?'' his streetwise partner asks. ``Nauseous
yet?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Caulfield assures him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, naturally, he pukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to show is sensitivity to what's
going on in the world as far as violence goes,'' ``Badland''
executive producer Kevin Fox said, ``and a real, honest,
responsible reaction to real violence and what goes on in the
street. And I think that's one really strong way to show that, you
know, violence is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Extremely strong, though not of stomach. But it could have been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   At least he didn't eat his dog. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SEVILLE, Spain _ Nobody expected all of this from Michael Johnson.
Not the coaches who got their first glimpses of his unorthodox
running style. Not even his parents, who were only interested in
raising their five children to go through life with their feet
planted firmly on the ground and a plan to succeed somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a month, Paul Johnson, a truck driver, would gather his
three girls and two boys _ Michael is the youngest _ around the
dinner table and conduct family meetings. Ruby Johnson, an
elementary school teacher, was a few feet away preparing their
meal.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects varied, depending on which of the siblings happened
to be the most talkative that day. But always, in the end, the
discussion would return to Paul Johnson's favorite theme _ setting
goals and then doing all you can to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   On the laundry list of achievements of the greatest long
sprinter of all time, there is now just one goal left to fulfill:
the world record for 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's glaring,'' Johnson candidly admits.
</P>
<P>
   Time on the bigger stopwatch of life says he'd better do it
soon. Johnson will turn 32 next month and cannot realistically
expect to have many more seasons left to eclipse Butch Reynolds'
1988 record of 43.29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's career best is 43.39, set in the 400 finals at the
1995 World Championships in Sweden, coming in the middle of a
grueling eight rounds of heats that went into his unprecedented
200/400 double, which Johnson repeated in 1996 at the Olympics in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Considering he will likely attempt the double again in Sydney
next summer, this championship in which he's running only the 400
could be his best chance.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Hart, Johnson's coach, had calculated that a time of 43.26
was forthcoming. But based on Johnson's lap in Tuesday night's
semifinals, that may be too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance that appeared equally amazing and effortless,
Johnson turned off his jets coming down the stretch and spent the
last 60 meters looking all around to his left and his right, like a
sightseer on a tour bus, and still clocked 43.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I've got to do, I'm prepared for it,'' he said. ``We
have a day of rest now, and we'll see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get it, I'm not going to cry over it. Any time I'm
in this kind of shape, it's possible. I would like to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, that statement is the equivalent of leaping onto a
table in a sequined toreador outfit and dancing the flamenco, since
he normally ranks just a bit behind Al Gore on the flamboyancy
scale. Throughout his career _ and perhaps it is one of the keys to
the broad body of his success _ Johnson has been a champion as
remarkable for his containment as for his speed and durability.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, as the finish line comes into sight, it is clear
that breaking the oldest running record on the books would mean
something special and might also help Johnson answer some critics
who have risen up recently to hint that he had come up with several
convenient injuries this summer in order to keep his mantle of
invincibility intact.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson withdrew from a showdown in the 200 at the U.S.
Nationals with Maurice Greene in June, Track &AMP; Field News hinted
that he was suffering from the ``9.79 flu,'' a reference to
Greene's world record in the 100 that had been set just a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   How could Johnson have been injured, Track &AMP; Field News
wondered, if just one week later, he ran a 43.92 in the 400, the
fastest time in the world this year, and a very hot 19.93 in the
200?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also pulled out of a meet July 30 in Europe, again
citing injury. Again he was greeted by cynicism. So what gives?
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnson's physical therapist, it's his sacroiliac,
where the pelvis meets the spine. Johnson suffers occasionally when
the joint rotates out of alignment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not considered a career-threatening condition but is a
bothersome one that can be corrected quickly with immediate
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson admits he has never been forthcoming concerning
injuries. But the recent spate of criticism has angered him. Since
1990 in the 200 meters, he has run against either the No. 1- or No.
2-ranked man in 49 percent of his races. And in the 400, that
figure tops 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 10 years, I'd say my reputation has been built
on handling pressure, taking on all comers,'' he said. ``And over
the last six weeks, it's like that's been forgotten and wiped away.
I'd like to do something to change this mistaken impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Like finally running down Butch Reynolds' 400 record.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a goal. Something Michael Johnson learned all about a
long time ago in those discussions around the dinner table.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MANAGER REBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk)

   NEW YORK _ Larry Dierker cannot remember the bad parts _
collapsing in the dugout, the game suspended, the Houston Astros
huddling in public prayer, the television cameras capturing all of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the pain, the anguish, the emotion was spent by other
people,'' Dierker said evenly. ``My wife, my family, my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the good parts _ the sacks of letters, full of
personal experience, along with the prayers he acknowledges as a
force in his healing.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has been back for six weeks, after a month recuperating
from surgery following a seizure from malformed blood vessels in
his brain. He was enjoying his fourth career Tuesday night,
managing Houston to a 5-1 victory in 10 innings over the New York
Mets in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   He was not all right on June 13, when he went down in the dugout
in the eighth inning. He has talked so much that he might be
tempted to be bored, but Dierker is not the typical manager.
</P>
<P>
   First he was a pitcher, then he sold season tickets and then he
was a broadcaster, a droll presence in a Hawaiian shirt who knew
the game and also read hardcover books in his spare time. But until
he managed the Astros in 1997, he had never called for that most
intricate of sporting maneuvers, the National League double switch
on the lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   His broadcasting career taught him a few things, including the
fine art of entertaining during rain delays and pitching changes.
Using those same skills, Dierker graciously talked about the ordeal
Tuesday, surely for the 1,000th time. He seemed motivated to talk
not by narcissism but by his appreciation for strangers, and his
new love of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unconscious for four days and I lost my sense of time,''
Dierker said. ``I knew I had surgery on the second day, that I had
seen doctors, had an MRI, but other people had to put the pieces
together for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The terror was in the eyes of the people who were with him in
the first frightening days _ his wife, Judy, two grown daughters,
Ashley and Julia, and Ryan, 14. Dierker was told he had an
arteriovenous malformation, a condition present from birth, and
that the dangerous vessels had been removed, and his prognosis was
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four days in the hospital, I got out of bed and found I
had balance,'' Dierker said. ``I could walk, normally. I went down
to the nursing station and got a cup of coffee and the newspaper. I
found I could walk and talk and read and smell the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a period of one minute, I had a check on my senses,''
Dierker said. ``It was such a marvelous experience, the greatest
experience in my life. Everything was so vivid to me. For me, it
was better than scuba diving on a coral reef, better than being on
the top of a mountain in Aspen, better than playing golf in Hawaii.
Just sitting and reading the paper and drinking coffee. We take
these things for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he could, Dierker answered every one of perhaps 1,000
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy who had brain surgery had self-published a book of 80
pages,'' Dierker recalled. ``A lady who was so immobilized that she
could hardly walk or talk had written 30 pages on her experience.
It wasn't just get-well cards. These people had empathy with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed by how many people wrote me from St. Louis and
Chicago and New York and Los Angeles, people who weren't Astros
fans. I got one from Australia and one from Astros fans who were
visiting in France. I heard about people who prayed when they saw
it happen on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who calls himself ``a Christian of recent vintage,
after 20 years of prodding by my wife,'' said he was aware of the
spiritual message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised with a rational bent to me, but it took me a
while to come around to understand this,'' Dierker said. ``There's
a good chance it made some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He was back to work on July 15, noticing for a few weeks that
``I was quick to anger, not just during games but things at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker added: ``But that has dissipated, too. Now I'm back to
where I was.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one difference: Dierker received a letter from a
12-year-old in New York whose best friend had died ``and was
feeling pretty bad about it,'' and Dierker arranged to meet the
boy, and the family of the boy who died, before Monday's game. He
feels it is the least he can do to give thanks for a support system
that already existed by the time he woke up.

NORMAN WEXLER, 73, WRITER OF `SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Norman Wexler, a playwright and screenwriter whose credits
included the scripts for ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Serpico,''
died on Monday at his home in Washington. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Jane Kepner, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Detroit in a blue-collar family, Wexler had a knack
for writing characters with a little dirt under their fingernails.
In ``Serpico,'' he helped create a vivid biographical portrait of
an undercover New York City detective, Frank Serpico, whose
testimony about police corruption made him a hero to the public and
a pariah to many in the police force. The script, which Wexler
wrote with Waldo Salt, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Wexler would win more plaudits for his
screenplay for ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the story of a Brooklyn
paint store clerk, Tony Manero, whose workaday life falls away on
the dance floor. The movie, released in 1977, made a film star of a
young John Travolta, and earned tens of millions of dollars at the
box office.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Harvard College, Wexler moved to New York in
1951 to work in advertising. But by the mid-1960s, he was writing
plays, several of which were produced in New York and at regional
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   His film career took off in 1970, with ``Joe,'' a drama starring
Peter Boyle as an unstable ruffian who forms an awkward alliance
with an upper-class businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by John Avildsen, was a hit with audiences,
and while its reviews were mixed, many critics paid credit to
Wexler's gritty dialogue and plot. Writing in The New York Times,
Howard Thompson called Wexler's scenario ``uncannily knowing and
observant in staking out and stalking two human species.'' It
earned Wexler another Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler's life was shadowed by mental illness. Diagnosed as manic
depressive, he was arrested and jailed in 1972 after making threats
against President Nixon while on a flight from New York to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler's career also faltered somewhat as he grew older. In the
early 1980s, he was hired by Travolta to write ``Stayin' Alive,'' a
sequel to ``Saturday Night Fever.'' He wound up sharing the writing
credit with Sylvester Stallone, who also directed the film, but it
was a critical and commercial disappointment. ``Raw Deal,'' a 1986
Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle that Wexler wrote with Gary Devore,
was also unsuccessful. He stayed busy, though; in 1996, his last
play, a comedy called ``Forgive Me, Forgive Me Not,'' was produced
at a theater in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime resident of Greenwich, Conn., Wexler moved to
Washington two years ago. He is survived by a sister, Janet Rosen,
of Detroit, and two daughters, Merin and Erica, both of New York.

MARTHA ROUNTREE, 87, A CREATOR OF `MEET THE PRESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., S.C., Md., Mass., Conn., N.C.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN FILES

<P>
   Martha Rountree, the co-creator and first moderator of the NBC
News program ``Meet the Press,'' died on Monday at Sibley Hospital
in Washington. She was 87 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, 1945, Ms. Rountree and Lawrence Spivak introduced
the show on radio, unveiling it two years later on television,
where it has since become television's longest-running program. In
1997, at the 50th anniversary celebration of ``Meet the Press,''
held at the National Building Museum in Washington, Ms. Rountree
was honored as the only female moderator of the program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her work with ``Meet the Press,'' she produced
several other radio and television shows, including ``Keep
Posted,'' ``Washington Exclusive,'' ``Leave It to the Girls,''
``Press Conference'' and ``Capitol Close Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rountree lost a coin-toss to Spivak in 1953 to determine who
would buy out the other's interest in the program. They agreed that
she would not develop a competing program for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a news pioneer who helped create a national
treasure,'' said Tim Russert, the chief of NBC News' Washington
Bureau who now serves as moderator of ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the show and becoming a popular lecturer, Ms.
Rountree in 1965 founded Leadership, a nonprofit political research
foundation based in Washington, and served as president of the
organization until 1988. A member of the National Press Club and
the Women's National Press Club, she received awards in recent
years from the Women for Achievement, the National Fraternity of
Women in Journalism and the American Legion.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Rountree was born in Gainesville, Fla., in 1911. After
spending her youth in Columbia, S.C., she enrolled at the
University of South Carolina. She then worked in South Carolina for
The Columbia Record, before returning to Florida as a reporter for
The Tampa Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 she moved to New York City, where she worked as a
freelancer and wrote advertising copy for several magazines. She
founded radio's first panel show, ``Leave It to the Girls,'' in
1940 before creating ``Meet the Press,'' which became the template
for the Sunday political talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rountree married Oliver Presbrey in 1952. Presbrey, an
advertising executive, died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, Martha Wiethorn of Bethesda,
Md., and Mary Greene of Duxbury, Mass.; a sister, Ann Rountree
Forsberg of Greenwich, Conn.; a brother, Calvin Rountree of
Hayesville, N.C., and three grandchildren.
