WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's army retook Parliament in a midnight raid and
pushed more than 2,000 students to leave the complex they had
occupied for five days. There were no casualties reported in the
operation, which lasted barely two hours, but witnesses said some
students initially resisted the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate voted to punish foreign enterprises or
institutions, especially in Russia, that provide sensitive missile
technology or expertise to Iran. The House passed the same measure
by voice vote in November, so the bill now goes to the White
House, where the president is being adviced to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Depicting the United States as superior to all potential
foes in conventional combat but vulnerable to terrorists and
saboteurs, President Clinton moved on a broad front Friday to
shore up the nation's defenses and protect its troops and citizens
against electronic or germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton for the first time has indicated
a willingness to commit the United States to joining the
international treaty banning land mines by 2006. But he linked the
move to development of alternate weapons.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Forbids Fees on Primary School Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has decided
to forbid any kind of fees to be charged on school pupils in first
to fifth grades, the official RSS news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Education and Housing and Physical Planning Arjun
Narsingh K.C., who announced the decision on Friday, said the
government will take action against and withhold grants from any
school which is found collecting any fees from students in an
illegal manner.
</P>
<P>
He said steps had also been initiated toward illegalizing the
act of raising arbitrary fees from secondary school children in
sixth to 10th grades.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on workers of the ruling Nepali Congress to
launch a campaign to send all children in every village off to
school.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has declared free education for first to
10th grade students in public schools.
</P>
<P>
But guardians and students have complained that they were
forced to pay fees ranging from 400-500 rupees to 2,500 rupees in
the name of admission fee, monthly fee, tuition fee, English
language fee, or donations.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the current educational year, the Ministry
of Education directed all the public and private schools through
the public media not to charge such fees illegally.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Win Uber Cup Badminton Finals for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Runners-up China ensured a record
sixth Uber Cup Finals victory after beating defending champions
Indonesia 4-1 in the 17th world women's team championships final
here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was a successful comeback for China, which, after five
consecutive wins from 1984 to 1992, had finished runners-up to
Indonesia in the past two championships.
</P>
<P>
China's world number one Ye Zhaoying defeated world number
seven Susi Susanti 11-9, 10-11, 11-5 in the opening singles match
and top-ranked Chinese doubles pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun downed
Indonesians Rosiana Zelin and Indarti Isoliana 15-7, 15-1 in the
following doubles.
</P>
<P>
China's world number three Gong Zhichao, 20, was the player of
the day as she scored a come-from-behind victory over 10th-ranked
Indonesian Mia Audina, beating her 9-11, 12-10, 11-4 in the second
singles and the third match of the final, in one hour and 17
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Indonesian had beaten Gong twice in their three
previous meetings since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Audina, Olympic silver-medalist from the Atlanta Games, came
from behind at 4-6 to win the first game 11-9. Gong returned
strongly to take the second after lagging behind 7-10, with superb
volleys and drops.
</P>
<P>
Numerous errors cost Audina badly in the decisive rubber, which
helped Gong lead throughout the game to a 11-4 win.
</P>
<P>
China had actually won the final after the unbeatable 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
A new Indonesian combination of Eliza and Denyana Lomban came
from a one-game deficit to win over China's world number two duo
Yin Yiyuan and Tang Yongshu 5-15, 15-11, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
And fifth-ranked Dai Yun sealed up the Chinese victory by
defeating her 32nd-ranked Indonesian opponent Meiluwati 11-3, 11-6
in the evening's closing match, a singles.
</P>
<P>
"All the first two singles players from both China and
Indonesia demonstrated world's top-class performance today. Susi
Susanti and Mia Audina performed very well in this major
tournament, but our players did even better," said China's head
coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
"Ye Zhaoying has improved a lot, both mentally and technically,
since the last championships. But she still made more errors than
Susanti today. Ye had to further improve her play," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Gong Zhichao was in high moral today, with improved footwork
and flexibility on the court. But she had failed time and again to
unleash killer shots, which would be among her major weak points,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese head coach played down the importance of Ye's
win over Susanti. He reminded those at the press conference that
the Indonesian ace was still the one to watch. "This is not the
first time for Ye to beat her," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas Cup badminton final will be played between Indonesia
and Malaysia here Sunday evening.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Committed to Further Reforms for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) is committed to further reforms in a bid to play
more active role in reversing the deterioration of the global
environment.
</P>
<P>
A decision on UNEP reforms adopted at the fifth special
session of the UNEP Governing Council said that the on-going
process of globalization and liberalization has serious
implications for the global environment.
</P>
<P>
The Governing Council is concerned at the continuing trends of
deterioration in the state of the global environment and is
mandated to reverse the continuing trends of deterioration in the
state of the global environment, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfill the mandate, ministers and other senior
government officials attending the special session closed here
Friday called for "a strong, effective and revitalized UNEP."
</P>
<P>
The participants expressed their support for the reform
proposals for UNEP presented to them at the three-day meeting by
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer.
</P>
<P>
They said in the decision that "reform should aim at the
further enhancement of the role of United Nations Environment
Program as the principal United Nations body in the field of the
environment."
</P>
<P>
The reform's aim is in keeping with the spirit of the Nairobi
Declaration adopted last year at the 19th session of the UNEP
Governing Council, the decision noted.
</P>
<P>
The special session endorsed the new areas of concentration
for UNEP in short and medium terms, namely, environmental
information, assessment and research; enhanced coordination of
environmental conventions; fresh water; technology transfer and
support to Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session held here Friday, Topfer said that "we
have come to an atmosphere of constructive cooperation,
partnership and common responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"In this atmosphere," he stressed, "we must try our utmost to
develop UNEP, to make this institution once again the
environmental voice of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
In his closing remarks, Arnaldo Jose Gabaldon, President of
the Governing Council and former Venezuelan Minister of
Environment, noted that "we are now on the right track. UNEP is
recovering its sense of purpose, its lofty mission."
</P>
<P>
In another decision on fresh water, the special session called
upon UNEP to "play a vital role in the environmental aspects of
the sustainable development of fresh water."
</P>
<P>
The session decided to enhance the role of UNEP in this field
through providing environmental, technical and scientific advice,
facilitating the transfer of technology to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP Governing Council composed of 58 members is mandated
to assess the state of the world environment, establish UNEP's
program priorities and approve the budget.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Governing Council are elected by the United
Nations General Assembly for a four-year term and the 20th
regular session of the Governing Council will be held in May
1999.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Red Crescent Ready to Help Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Red Crescent Society
said on Saturday that it is ready to cooperate with the Iraqi Red
Crescent to distribute relief supplies in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Voicing hope that the Iraqi government would agree to the move,
Chairman Berges Hmoud Al-Berges of Kuwait Red Crescent said the
cooperation would be based purely on humanitarian bases "to help
the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Al-Berges said five volunteers of his organization would travel
to Iranian capital Tehran on Sunday to observe the distribution of
relief supplies, including foodstuff and blankets, to Iraqi and
Kurdish refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The move is viewed as a goodwill gesture of Kuwait, which
observers here said might lead to improvement of the bitter
relations between the two Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait-Iraq ties broke down after Iraq's occupation of the
Gulf sheikdom from August 1990 to February 1991.
</P>
<P>
After Iraq recognized the United Nations-demarcated border with
Kuwait and started to pay compensation for its invasion and the
ensuing Gulf War, the issue of prisoners of war remains the sticky
problem.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that 625 people went missing in the final days
of Iraq's occupation. Iraq denies holding any Kuwaitis that it
detained at that time.

will host this year's world junior badminton championships in late
October, the International Badminton Federation (IBF) announced
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The world championships had originally been set to be held in

And, the IBF signed here on Saturday a co-operative agreement
with the organizers of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The

<HEADLINE> PNA Welcomes Gingrich's Decision to Cancel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has said that it welcomed the decision by
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich to cancel his tour to proposed
site of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel Radio reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said that the decision, which was made on Friday at
the request of the U.S. administration, is good for advancing the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who arrived here Saturday afternoon, will meet
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich had planned to have a tour at the proposed site of
the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, which was originally scheduled
on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He called off the visit following protests from Palestinians
who said such a tour could trigger bloodshed by meddling in the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians wants the east Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state, while Israel insists that the
holy city is its indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War
and later annexed it.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the U.S. Congress passed an non-binding resolution,
endorsing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and calling on the
U.S. administration to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. administration, like most of other governments,
is keeping its embassy in Tel Aviv until a settlement is reached
on the status of Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
praised the referendum endorsement of the Irish peace accord, and
pledged U.S. help in economic development to enable peace to take
root in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In an audiotaped message to the Irish people, Clinton called
Saturday's vote count in favor of a new compromise government for
the troubled British province "a beacon to peoples around the
globe in places where strife prevails and peace seems remote."
</P>
<P>
He hailed the endorsement as "culmination of a springtime of
peace" and "beginning of a long season of happiness and
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the smiling eyes of Irish Americans, of whom he is
one, Clinton said:"We are very proud of you."
</P>
<P>
"As of today, peace is no longer a dream, it is a reality," the
president said. "You have indeed joined hope to history."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made peacemaking in Northern Ireland a priority for his
administration and designated former Sen. George Mitchell as his
special envoy to take care of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Saturday, Clinton said his
administration will work with Northern Ireland's leaders to
transform the promise of the accord into reality.
</P>
<P>
"Working through the International Fund for Ireland and the
private sector, we will help the people seize opportunities that
peace will bring to attract new investment, to create new
factories, workplaces and jobs and establish new centers of
learning to prepare for the 21st century," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Privatization of Egyptian Public Banks Should Take </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's leading banking official
said Saturday that privatization of public banks should take place
"gradually" under strong professional supervision.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Middle East News Agency, Abdel Aziz,
chairman of Egyptian Banks Union, proposed that public sector
commercial banks be privatized through greater participation of
international investors instead of sale.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector inside or outside Egypt could be invited to
subscribe to an increase in the capital of banks in an appropriate
percentage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A first step," he said, could be taken with reducing the state
ownership in a bank from 100 percent to 60 percent and offering
the rest to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that sale of shares to foreigners should not cause
any concern, adding that the operation of foreign banks in
Egypt has increased competition and improved the performance of
public sector banks.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's economic committee this week approved a bill
to regulate private sector participation in the capital of public
sector banks, allowing the private sector to own stake in banks
wholly owned by the state. Parliament is expected to vote on the
bill in June.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Aziz is also chairman of the National Bank of Egypt,
which together with Banque Misr, Banque du Caire and Bank of
Alexandria are the country's four biggest state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Egyptian Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros
Ghali said that the government would not privatize state banks
before 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ghali promised that state banks would not be fully sold to
foreigners for the time being because of instable world financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Ghali's remarks were made to dispel fears that the Central
Bank would turn idle and lose its strict control on public and
private banks in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
These fears were triggered by the bill endorsed in principle by
the parliament economic committee to privatize public banks.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ambassador on Romanian President's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The visit of Romanian President
to Canada would be of both political and economic importance, and
major decisions are to be made concerning the future relationship
of the two countries, said Canadian ambassador to Romania Gilles
Duguay in an interview published on Saturday by daily The Current.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian ambassador said that the visit of Emil
Constantinescu would have two equally important components, an
economic one regarding cooperation for the finalization of the
nuclear-power plant at Cernavoda (southeastern Romania), and a
political one, related to Romania's integration into the
North-Atlantic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian authorities continue to back Romania's bid to
enter NATO as firmly as in 1997 in Madrid", stressed Gilles
Duguay. "Much attention has to be paid to what will happen in
Canada, as the Canadians are going to demonstrate to President
Constantinescu, to the Romanian government and people that they
mean it when they say that they want Romania to be a member of the
North-Atlantic Alliance", he added.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian diplomat said that Canada is Romania's ally not
only economically, culturally or socio-economically, but Romania's
ally in time of peace or war, in the destiny of the states members
of the North-Atlantic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu will pay an official
visit to Canada from May 24 to 30 at the invitation of Governor
General Romeo Leblanc. During the visit, he is scheduled to meet
with Leblanc, Prime Minister Jean Chretien, the speakers of the
Senate and the House of Commons.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Demand Resignation of Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Iranian
students Saturday demanded judiciary head Mohammad Yazdi resign
and the state radio, television and the police be reformed.
</P>
<P>
"Yazdi, resign, Yazdi, resign," students shouted at a ceremony
held at Tehran University to mark the anniversary of the election
of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony organizers asked the crowd not to shout slogans
they have not arranged, but the students continued expressing
their opposition to Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
They also call for reform of the state media, shouting "radio,
television, reform."
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary, radio and television as well as
the police have been accused by the moderates of undermining
Khatami's government.
</P>
<P>
The students voiced support for Khatami and his mottos of
freedom of expression and rule of law.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the moderates are using the ceremony to
fight against the conservatives, who are controlling Iran's key
organs, including the parliament, the judiciary, the state radio
and television, the armed forces and police.
</P>
<P>
Since Khatami, a moderate cleric who advocates social reforms,
came to power last year, Iran has been witnessing factional
struggles between the moderates and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The struggles reached the peak last month when the judiciary
detained symbol of the moderates Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi on embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
The moderates claimed that the rival factions intended to use
the case to avenge their defeat in the presidential elections and
tried to stop Khatami's campaign to offer more freedom to the
Iranian society.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists Seek Support for Anti-Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party (KPRF)
leader Gennady Zyuganov on Saturday called on the Federation
Council, Russia's upper house of parliament, to back a State Duma
motion for impeaching President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that the KPRF held an
irregular congress Saturday to discuss the current situation in
Russia, amendments to the Constitution and impeachment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door emergency congress was attended by 193
delegates, including 71 members of the State Duma and three
members of the Federation Council, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 200 deputies of the State Duma gave
their support for starting impeachment proceedings in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
State Duma Speaker, communist Gennady Seleznyov, said on
Saturday that the motion to impeach Yeltsin will receive
consideration in Russia's Lower House on June 2.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, some regional governors
who are members of the upper house dismissed the initiative of the
State Duma to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Federation Council Yegor Stroyev said that the
council was against any aggravation of the situation in the
country and consistently stood for compromises to defuse "the
springtime tension in society".
</P>
<P>
The recent protest actions appeared to be snowballing across
Russia with the coal miners being in the lead.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Zyuganov few days ago proposed on behalf of
the party in parliament to "support the initiative of the miners,
scientists in the Far East, teachers and students whose main
slogan is the demand for the resignation of the president."
</P>
<P>
The call for the resignation of the president came not only
from the Far East but also from North Russia, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: U.S. New Sanction Bill Has No Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Saturday that the U.S. Senate's new sanction
bill against Iran would have no effect because Iran has no plan
to purchase missile technology.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi termed the new sanction bill as a "face-saving move
aimed to divert attention from the failure of d'Amato law,"
according to the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
"Washington will not impose sanctions against any foreign
firms because Iran does not plan to purchase missile technology
and has no contacts with any foreign firms in this regard," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate on Friday approved a sanction bill on firms
which sell missile technology to Iran, after U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced on Tuesday not to impose sanction on the French,
Russian and Malaysian companies for concluding a contract of 2
billion U.S. dollars with Iran to develop an Iranian gas field.
</P>
<P>
According to the d'Amato law signed by Clinton in 1996,
Washington will punish any company which has an investment of more
than 40 million dollars in the energy sector of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran has always been an advocate of a
Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction and will
continue to do so, but adding that Israel, supported by the U.S.,
has jeopardized the regional security with its stockpile of
weapons of mass destruction.

TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
reiterated the importance of rule of law on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of students at Tehran University to
mark the anniversary of his ascendance to power, Khatami said a
society should rely on the basis of laws, particularly the
constitution, and freedom should be within the framework of laws.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom is different from chaos, freedom should be put within
the framework of laws," he said, stressing that all the people,
including those who have powers, should respect the laws.
</P>
<P>
Khatami highlighted the need to tolerate differences of views,
saying the people have the right of expression and one should
respect views of others.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that laws and respect for the law
have become a value in the country, adding that "today we need to
join hands to put this value to work" and the government,
parliament and judiciary should take the lead in the drive.
</P>
<P>
He said the epic of the presidential elections neither belongs
to the president nor to any particular groups, it belongs to the
noble nation of Iran.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials for Lesotho's
general election have begun counting ballot papers following the
closure of some of the country's polling stations at 5 p.m. local
time (1500 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Voting was still continuing Saturday night in certain
constituencies due to a shortage of polling booths or staff at
some of the polling stations, South African Press Association
quoted an Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to election arrangements, polling stations begin
counting votes as soon as voting is finished there. The first
results were expected by 8.30 p.m. (1830 GMT) Saturday, IEC
chairman Sekara Mafisa said.
</P>
<P>
Mafisa described the election as peaceful and relatively
successful, adding that a large percentage of the 800,000
registered voters had already cast their votes by the time most
polling booths closed at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
He said polling stations would not close until all people who
were still queuing to vote had cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of voters started making their way to polling
stations in the small hours of the day as many people in the tiny
mountain kingdom live far away from the nearest polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Twelve political parties and 31 independent candidates are
participating in the election, the third since the country gained
independence in 1966.

TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Saudi Arabia signed an
agreement here on Saturday on technical, industrial and
engineering cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached between Iran's Chamber of Commerce
and Saudi Petrochemical and Metals Industry, the two countries
will join efforts in developing copper and power industry, and
make joint investments.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Saudi firm Reza Aqil Mohammad Aqil said the
foundation for cooperation was laid in a visit to his country by
Chairman of Iran's State Expediency Council Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in March.
</P>
<P>
He said Saudi Arabia imported 40 million U.S. dollars worth of
copper cables from Iran in the past three years and expressed
belief that the amount will rise in the future.
</P>
<P>
Aqil voiced Saudi willingness to cooperate with Iran in
building power stations, laying oil and gas pipelines to the
Indian Subcontinent and from the Caspian Sea to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Saudi firms are interested in investing in the projects in
Iran's free trade zones and finding access to Central Asian
markets, he added.

ABU DHABI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed
al-Nahyan said here Saturday that without security and stability
in the Gulf region, there can be no development nor progress.
</P>
<P>
During his talks on Saturday evening with visiting Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi, al-Nahyan urged the Gulf countries
to work for maintaining security and stability in the vital area
which is important not only for its people but for the whole
world, the UAE news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The countries of the region have to understand that security
and stability are the basis of development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both the UAE and Iran are two Muslim countries and neighbors
that have long-standing historical ties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Al-Nahyan welcomed his guest and expressed hope that his visit
will prove success.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi agreed with his host on the importance of stability for
the region, saying that "due to the prevailing wisdom of all
parties, the region is enjoying this relative stability."
</P>
<P>
The main aim of Kharazi's visit to the UAE is to discuss with
the UAE side the ways of solving the issue of the three disputed
islands, namely, Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, according
to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is the main obstacle on the way of improving the
UAE-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the UAE news agency did not say whether today's talks
dealt with the issue of the three islands.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister arrived here Saturday afternoon
on a two-day visit to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Kharazi will convey a message from
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to UAE President Sheikh Zayed
Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE has been locked in a dispute over ownership of
the three islands located on the edge of the Strait of Hormuz,
which Iran has taken control.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has stood firm in the dispute and kept calling for
returning its full sovereignty over the three islands through a
direct and peaceful dialog or the arbitration of the International
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
But Iran has so far refused arbitration, saying the islands are
an inseparable part of its territory.

<HEADLINE> OPEC May Cut Oil Output Further: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Obeid Bin Saif Al Nasir,
Sunday disclosed that the organization may further cut production
if the oil prices remain at the current low level.
</P>
<P>
He said that any new cut in OPEC production should unanimously
be accepted by the member states and in coordination with other
oil producers outside the body.
</P>
<P>
Al Nasir, also minister of petroleum and mineral sources of the
United Arab Emirates, made the comments on the sidelines of a
seminar on oil markets and economies of the Gulf states which
opened here Sunday,
</P>
<P>
OPEC is scheduled to hold its ordinary mid-year meeting on

petroleum markets, in the light of its March decision on voluntary
reduction of oil production by 1.245 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Al Nasir asserted that measures have to be taken to reach an
appropriate oil price, including a cut in production in case of
excessive supply in world markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that OPEC was effective in the oil market and was
carrying out its functions correctly.
</P>
<P>
OPEC was established in 1960 with the aim to defend the
producers' interests and to achieve stability in the world oil
markets.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Continued Mideast Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Sunday called for continued Arab and international efforts to move
forward the peace process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark following talks here between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat on the "clear collapse" of the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also explored ways to deal with Israel's
constant rejection to cooperate with various proposals to break
the deadlock in the peace-making, said the Egyptian top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has thus entered a stalled phase and most
likely a complete failure in light of the current conditions,"
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"But efforts must not come to a halt and the Israeli policy
must not be allowed to lead to serious losses on the regional and
international levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had left for home after a few hours' visit here Sunday
for talks with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak returned home Saturday night from his five-day visit to
France, where he and French President Jacques Chirac called for an
international conference on the Middle East peace to break the
long-running deadlock.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday, the Palestinian Cabinet hailed
the Egyptian-French initiative and called upon the world community
to support it.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-French proposal was also a top issue at the
Mubarak-Arafat talks, together with the available options on the
Arab and international arenas, according to Moussa.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the current and future levels of Arab and
international consultations in a bid to overcome the impasse in
the peace process after Israel has rejected a U.S. proposal on a
13.1 percent further redeployment in the West Bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israel objected to the Egyptian-French proposal
for fear of coordinated international pressure.
</P>
<P>
French officials have said that the proposed conference would
initially be attended by surrounding countries not at war with
Israel and then by outside interested parties such as the major
powers.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's strategy of
diversifying its economy by developing tourism in addition to
clove planting has started to bear fruits, the isles' President
Salmin Amour has said.
</P>
<P>
The isles authorities have since 1986 approved 219 development
projects, worth 4.3 billion U.S. Dollars, after the clove exports
began to shrink in the international market, Amour was quoted by
Sunday Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the projects, 128 projects worth three billion U.S. Dollars
are related to tourism. Some of the projects have been completed
while others are still underway, Amour said Saturday while
closing the 23rd Africa Travel Association (ATA) congress in
north Tanzania's Arusha.
</P>
<P>
At present, tourism in Tanzania's Zanzibar, consisting of the
twin islands of Unguja and Pemba, as well as 20 smaller islands
in the Indian Ocean, employs more than 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Amour called for building more hotels in the isles with
improved services, noting that present hotel capacity stands at
3,000 beds against the demand of 20,000 beds.
</P>

He urged government agencies, organizations, individuals to
work together to restore the isles' economic glory in history.

isles government will safeguard the interest of foreign investors

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Economic Woes Take Time To be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- With its impact abating, the
10-month-old Asian financial crisis seems to have come to a low
ebb, prompting many people to think that the crisis-stricken
countries may begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
There are reasons for such optimism. For the past two months,
some countries in the region have showed signs of recovery from
the economic scourge -- their financial markets have been less
tumultuous, investor confidence restored somewhat and trickles of
capital beginning to flow back.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by these positive developments, many people have
struck an upbeat note, believing that the crisis would soon be
over.
</P>
<P>
However, economic analysts here were quick to point out that
the crisis, instead of subsiding, was likely to flex its muscles
again. Its "under currents" would probably raise huge storms under
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board,
warned recently that Asia has not yet gone through the dangerous
phase of the crisis and therefore would be subject to the possible
second round of attack.
</P>
<P>
The warning came not without reasoning. As the crisis was
deeply rooted in a web of political, economic and social issues in
countries concerned, and associated with both regional and
international factors, its solution entails domestic, regional and
international efforts. Because of such complexity, a relapse of
the crisis would probably occur at any time.
</P>
<P>
Analysts cited the following as the three major factors that
would determine the trend of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- The rising economic turmoil in Japan could dampen efforts to
defuse the financial crisis. Coupled with the worst economic
slowdown in decades, the Japanese yen dived to 136.65 against the
U.S. dollar on May 20. This was the lowest level since September
1991 and bodes ill for the Asian financial market.
</P>
<P>
The economic slump and financial turmoil in Japan itself would
force the country, the biggest investor in Asia, to withdraw
investment from the cash-strapped region. The depreciation of yen
which has been closely linked with the currencies of Southeast
Asian nations could rock the volatile financial market in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the financial crisis in the whole of Asia is
unlikely to come to an end before Japan could shrug off its own
economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
-- Unfavorable political factors in the region obstruct the way
to economic recovery. The Asian financial market would become
tumultuous again if the political situation in Indonesia took a
step backward.
</P>
<P>
-- Southeast Asian countries, staggering under the influence of
the financial crisis, are still far away from gaining a firm
foothold to weather any storms. They need to establish a sound and
strong economic and financial system to protect themselves against
political and economic uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Dogged by a series of domestic issues like huge foreign debt,
rising bad debts, contracting foreign reserves and shrinking
exports, these countries are easy to be swayed by unfavorable
events that occur inside or outside the region.
</P>
<P>
Given all these factors, there would be no quick-fix measures
and it will take time for Southeast Asian countries to heal their
economic woes, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Calls for African Support for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called on the African states to join efforts to
support the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president made the remarks in Luanda airport
Saturday on his way home from the Lisbon International Fair '98,
the media reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The whole Africa, especially the southern African nations,
should make joint efforts to press the opposition National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to implement the 1994
Lusaka Peace accord in a bid to achieve the final triumph of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano said that the peace process in Angola is
ostensibly facing crisis because in some areas of Angola the
military situation is tense.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that he has taken the way via Luanda to find out
the current situation in Angola and demonstrate Mozambique's
support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was sure that the Angolan peace process will
get rid of the existing troubles through all-out efforts.
</P>
<P>
On the current political situation in Mozambique, Chissano
said that the local elections will be held soon but the largest
opposition Mozambican Resistance Movement and some other smaller
parties will boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
If the elections take place as scheduled, they themselves mean
a big step toward democracy since they will be the first local
elections ever held in Mozambique, he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the investigation into the death of Mozambican former
President Samora Machel, Chissano said that the probe was forced
to suspend by the refusal of the former South African government.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican government required the death of Machel be probed
again after the African National Congress won in the first
all-race elections.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government suspects that the South African
apartheid regime had involved in the cause leading to the death
of Samora Machel, Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
At the Luanda Airport, President Chissano held talks with
Angolan President Eddo Dos Santos on political situation in their
countries and issues in the southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Both Mozambique and Angola are members of the Southern African
Development Community and members of the the community of the
Portuguese-speaking nations. They had helped each other in the
struggle against colonialism and in their peace processes after
liberation.

JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat emphasized Sunday in Gaza
that Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, according to the
Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the
Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel
should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Israel's activities marking the 31st
unification of Jerusalem which are going on on Sunday here. Israel
captured the whole Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged the United States to announce its peace
initiative concerning Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank
in order to put more pressure on the Israeli government to live up
to its contractual obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his meeting in Cairo with Egyptian
Presdient Hosni Mubarak, they discussed the Egyptian-French
initiative for convening an international conference for countries
aiming at breaking the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting was positive and constructive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of extremist Jewish demonstrators
are gathering near the Kattanin Gate that leads to the Al-Aqsa
Mosque in East Jerusalem, as part of their 31st celebrations of
Jerusalem unification.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish demonstrators burned a model of Oslo Accords and
tried to enter into the Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials and civilians, including the
PNA's Jerusalem governor, are gathering inside the premises of the
Mosque to try to prevent the Jewish demonstrators from entering
into the holy site.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Peace Bloc also demonstrated in East Jerusalem on
Sunday to voice their support for the the peace process.
</P>
<P>
There is so far no report of conflict between Israelis
demonstrators and Palestinians.

NANJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Tomiichi Murayama, a former prime
minister of Japan, attended activities to mark the 3rd anniversary
of the repair of Nanjing's old city wall today in the company of
Ikuo Hirayama, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
They also visited the Museum of the Nanjing Massacre Victims
(1937) this afternoon, where Murayama said: "I can hardly express
my feelings about the Nanjing Massacre," after placing a
wreath in memory of the victims, with the words: "Past experience,
if not forgotten, is a guide for the future."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese invasion of China in 1937 brought disaster to the
Chinese and Asian people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The wall in Nanjing, which is the capital of Jiangsu Province,
was first built from 1368 to 1386 during the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644), but was destroyed by Japanese troops, who slaughtered
some 300,000 Chinese in December of 1937.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the city wall has been rebuilt,
using nearly 350 million yuan that was raised by the city
government and local people, and more than 70 million yen in
Japanese donations. More than 20,000 Japanese have participated in
the repair work.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Writing off Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said on Sunday that he has no intention of writing off
the Mideast peace process in his speech last Friday to foreign
diplomats in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"What I said on Friday was misunderstood and Israel will move
the peace process forward and Israelis and the Palestinians could
reach peace if the Palestinians take reciprocal actions," he told
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to foreign diplomats, Netanyahu said "peace
collapsed two years ago" during a wave of suicide bombings in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We had no peace. We had a collapse of peace, maybe not in the
way this was perceived in various capitals around the world, but
the way it was in practice here," he was saying.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Palestinian National Authority for not
fighting terror as part of its commitments under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks have met strong criticism from Israel's
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres on Sunday accused the
Netanyahu government of not fulfilling commitments to the Oslo
accords, calling on it to carry out the three-phased troop
withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process collapsed after the current Likud-led
coalition came to power in June 1996, Peres said.
</P>
<P>
"We (the Labor government) had economic conventions in the
Middle East, they were stopped. We had a conference to fight
against terrorism, it was not resumed. Arab states which began
forging ties with us - stopped," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid said on Saturday that
Netanyahu "bought his position by lying."
</P>

The seven-member team which had three Nepalese was led by
57-year-old Mr. Douglas Keith Scott.
</P>
<P>
The team tried to overcome the peak from the west ridge, but

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungary on Sunday opened the
second round of legislative elections for a new National Assembly,
a move crucial to the country's political future.
</P>
<P>
Under Hungary's election law, the National Assembly is elected
after two rounds of balloting.
</P>
<P>
In the May 10 first round, left-wing Socialist Party finished
barely ahead of the right-wing opposition Federation of Young
Democrats-Hungarian Civic Party (Fidesz-MPP).
</P>
<P>
While the Socialists won 32.25 percent in the first round,
their liberal coalition partner, the Alliance of Free Democrats,
slumped to 7.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
That could open the way for Fidesz-MPP, which got 28.19
percent, to team up with other right-wing parties to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
Two party by-elections will be held in two states, where the
turnout in the first round failed to meet the minimum of 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the second round, a 25 percent turnout will make the ballots
valid.

The Washington Post:

HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Continuing economic and financial
turmoil in the Asian region is affecting Hong Kong's tourism,
media reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
showed that visitor arrivals in April dropped by 22.4 percent to
over 808,000 compared to the same month last year. Combining the
first four months together, arrivals were down by 24.2 percent to

64.8 percent, from Japan by 57.8 percent, from Indonesia by 56.4
percent, from Thailand by 54.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Any rebound from major markets in Asia is "entirely dependent
on an improvement in their own domestic economic and political
situations -- factors which are beyond anyone's control," Amy
Chan, executive director of HKTA, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Markets registering moderate growth included Canada, South and
Central America, New Zealand and India.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to monitor closely the situation and review our
forecast for arrivals this year," Chan noted, and pledged
reinforced joint efforts with the industry and the government to
maximize opportunities in the source markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israelis and Palestinians clashed
in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem on Sunday and at least two
Palestinians were injured so far.
</P>
<P>
Israelis are marking the 31st year of Jerusalem's unification
on Sunday. As part of the activities, right wing Jewish youths
from the organizations such as Temple Mount Faithful and Our
Jerusalem Movement demonstrated outside the Orient House in East
Jerusalem under the slogan "we will never leave here."
</P>
<P>
The Orient House is actually the office of the Ministry in
Charge of Jerusalem Affairs of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) in the Old City of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security forces tried to push the Jewish
demonstrators away from the Orient House and clash erupted
between them. Israeli security forces rushed in and prevented the
clash from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Israel has got well prepared for Sunday's celebration
activities in Jerusalem which include memorial services and mass
demonstrations. The police were ordered to act with force against
anyone attempting to disrupt the day of celebration.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians also warned that the celebration would
not deter them from establishing an independent state with East
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
They said that if any Jewish extremists approached Al-Aqsa
Mosque in East Jerusalem it would be considered a direct
aggression on the Muslim feelings.
</P>
<P>
Israel has mobilized a large number of additional security
forces in the city to maintain order on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, Palestinians clashed with Israeli soliders in
the area near Rachel's Tomb and Israeli soldiers fired teargas
and rubber bullets to dispurse the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians were injured and sent to a nearby hospital
for treatment, according to a Palestinian reporter.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police also tried their best to help maintain
the order after the clash erupted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior and junior staff of the
Central Bank of Nigeria have called on Head of State General
Sani Abacha to institute a high-powered Commission of Inquiry into
the activities of the apex bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the weekend, the bank workers said
lots of financial atrocities are being perpetrated by members of
the management staff, the Sunday Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued under the auspices of the Joint
Consultative Committee representing both junior and senior
workers, said that it had compiled a list of assets of top
executives both in the country and abroad which it was prepared
to submit to the government.
</P>
<P>
The committee accused the management of delaying the promotion
of workers and sacking them without any arrangement being made
for their replacement.
</P>
<P>
The lack of promotion has led to disillusionment and
declining productivity because vacancies now exist at various
executive positions which are yearning for occupation, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite being a financial institution, it was unwholesome for
an assistant director to act for a director or a senior manager
to act for a deputy director for up to six years without being
confirmed on the position.
</P>
<P>
Unless something urgent is done to arrest the situation,
activities at the apex bank could grind to a halt which
invariably will affect the nation's economy, it said.

JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho Congress
for Democracy (LCD) has won the overall majority by clutching 44
of the 80 constituencies in Saturday's general elections, South
African Press Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This gives the LCD 44 seats out of 80 being contested in the
National Assembly. Twelve political parties and 31 candidates
were participating in the country's third democratic election
since its independence in 1966.
</P>
<P>
The country's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said in
mid-Sunday that the LCD had won the Matsiteng constituency, the
King's traditional village, by 5,996 votes to the Basutho
National Party's (BNP) 1,875 and the Basutoland Congress Party's
(BCP) 521.
</P>
<P>
IEC's Chairman Sekara Mafisa said in capital Maseru that the
counting of the remaining ballot papers at other constituencies
was still continuing. He said that he hoped the final results
would be announced late on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
LCD' Deputy Leader Kelibone Maote expressed satisfaction about
his party's performance in the election so far, especially its
victory over the BNP and the BCP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, supporters of the BNP and the BCP claimed that the
results were not free and fair because of irregularities.

NANJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Five container trucks filled
with Chunlan air conditioners left Taizhou City, east China's
Jiangsu Province, recently to head for Zhongnanhai in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth consecutive year for the site of the Central

Zhongnanhai surely can make excellent publicity for Chunlan,

The leading air-conditioner maker in China and the
seventh-largest in the world, the Chunlan Group has spent about
one billion yuan (about 120.48 million U.S. dollars) in upgrading
its technology in recent years. The over 60 varieties of Chunlan
air-conditioners on sale this summer are all high-tech products.
</P>

The output and sales of Chunlan air-conditioner have ranked

<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Egyptians convicted of killing
nine German tourists and their Egyptian driver outside the famed
Egyptian Museum were hanged Sunday inside a prison, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saber Mohamed Farahat Abulela and his brother Mahmoud have been
sentenced to death by the state military court on charges of
shooting and fire-bombing a tourist bus outside the museum on
September 18, 1997, which led to 10 deaths and 26 injuries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ratified the death sentences
in December and the two brothers never appealed against his
decision.
</P>
<P>
The government has maintained the two brothers are not linked
to any of the Islamic groups, who have waged an off-and-on
insurgency since 1992 to try to topple the secular government led
by Mubarak and replace it with strict religious rule.
</P>
<P>
But a series of terror attacks on tourists, including the
world-shocked Luxor shooting of tourists, have dealt a fatal blow
to the country's tourism and ushered in an overhaul of Egypt's
security system.
</P>
<P>
The November 1997 shooting rampage by terrorists in southern
Egyptian city of Luxor left 62 people dead and 24 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Death by hanging is the maximum punishment for the charges
against the brothers.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Welcomes N. Irish Peace Vote Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela has
expressed his delight at the outcome of the referendums in
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in which voters
overwhelmingly backed a peace deal designed to end 30 years of
sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released late Saturday, Mandela said he would
like to express his "absolute delight" at the positive results on
behalf of South Africa's government, people and himself, local
media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Official results released Saturday showed about 71 percent of
Northern Ireland voters and 94 percent of the Irish Republic's
voters approved the peace agreement thrashed out by political
parties on April 10 after two years of talks.
</P>
<P>
"There have indeed been many dark and difficult days on the
road to achieving this momentous positive outcome," he said,
highlighting the efforts by all the involved sides in
"relentlessly encouraging and nurturing the process."
</P>
<P>
He congratulated the leaders of all the parties involved and
the voters, who had visibly demonstrated their desire for peace
and stability rather than conflict and violence.
</P>
<P>
South Africa believes that Northern Ireland would become a
"shining beacon of peace" to the international community through
further cooperation of all concerned, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Northern Ireland is to become
semi-autonomous, remaining a part of Britain but allowing Dublin
a formal say in its future for the first time.
</P>
<P>
An election will be held on June 25 to select a 108-member
Northern Ireland assembly, which will form the future government
of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> International Brands Competing in Shanghai's Cosmetics Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- International-brand cosmetic
commodities and detergent that are either imported or turned out by
Sino-overseas joint ventures have claimed more than 90 percent
of Shanghai's market share, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
Only one domestic brand has secured a place among the 20
best-selling shampoo and skin care series, says the survey
conducted by the Shanghai Commercial Information Center.
</P>
<P>
At the top of the shampoo popularity poll is "Rejoice", which
has 9.32 percent of the market portfolio; "Lux" ranks second
with a share of 6.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Zheng Mingming" has the largest skin care cosmetics market
share of 9.85 percent. The runner-up, "Yu Sai", takes up 8.64
percent.
</P>
<P>
China's huge market potential for cosmetics and detergent is
most attractive to many specialized transnationals. Currently, the
country's per capita annual spending on cosmetics stands at 1.56
U.S. dollars, in contrast to the world's average of 10
U.S. dollars. Last year, domestic cosmetic and detergent sales
went up 15 percent to 26 billion yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
In some large Chinese cities like Shanghai the per capita
annual spending on cosmetics approximates the world's average,
amounting to 80 yuan (about 9.6 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
So far, China has some 3,000 companies and plants producing
25,000 varieties of cosmetic products.
</P>
<P>
Experts anticipate that sales of detergent will continue to
go strong while competition on the cosmetic market will be more
acute.

<HEADLINE> South America Trip Promotes Trade, Investment: HK Financial Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang, financial secretary
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said here Sunday
that his trip to South America was "very successful" and would
promote trade and investment between Hong Kong and the countries
he visited.
</P>
<P>
Tsang made the remarks upon arrival at the airport from a
business promotion visit to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. He also
visited Japan, Geneva and London during the 19-day trip.
</P>
<P>
Joining the financial secretary on the trip were a delegation
of top businessmen representing Hong Kong's banking sector,
financial services, infrastructure, containerization as well as
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter's question on Hong Kong's economic
growth this year, Tsang said it is not necessary to make any
revision to last year's forecast of Hong Kong's GDP growth at this
moment.
</P>
<P>
"We made a (GDP growth) forecast of 3.5 percent for the year
1998. What we are seeing is not only the most dramatic financial
crisis we have seen since World War II, but we've also seen some
very uncertain events evolving."
</P>
<P>
"So I believe it would be premature and unnecessary to make a
revised forecast at this stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "We would be watching events very
closely. We had a very rough last quarter last year. We are going
to have an even rougher first quarter of this year. But we must
remember that we have very strong fundamentals."

KUALA LUMPUR, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Sunday launched a new
program to enable drug-dependent individuals or family members to
rehabilitate themselves from the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
The "A Day With the Community" program, launched by Deputy Home

workplace.
</P>
<P>
Tajol told reporters after the launch of the program that
"preliminary prevention entails creating drug-free schools while
national prevention involves having a family home, society and
workplaces, such as factories, that are void of the menace."
</P>
<P>
The program was to rid drug-infested areas by creating self
awareness and dignity among the residents, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Girls Want to Be Slimmer: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A psychological study shows that
the majority of preadolescent girls in Hong Kong are unsatisfied
with their bodies and want to be slimmer.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Psychology Department of the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, the study surveyed 1,944 girls at the age
of nine to 14 on their body concerns and weight control behaviors.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 58 percent of the girls were afraid of
becoming fat, 50 percent wanted to be slimmer, 38 percent felt the
need to lose weight, and 13 percent felt emotionally upset because
of their weight.
</P>
<P>
Many of these girls have begun to try different ways of weight
control even before they reach the age of puberty, the study
shows. They either experimented with dieting, or exercised a lot
to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
The fact that young Chinese girls become concerned about their
body weight at so early an age even before puberty indicates how
prevalent the thinner obsession is among women in our community,
said professor Leung Yiu Kin of the Psychology Department of the
Chinese University of Hong Kong, who is in charge of the survey.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the obsession, if not corrected, could lead to
serious physical and mental health problems in many young Chinese
women in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The study will be presented at the first International
Conference on Child and Adolescent Mental Health, to be held in
Hong Kong early in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The first communication ministers'
conference of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) ended here Sunday after adopting a Plan of Action on
Telecommunications (PAT) which calls for greater cooperation among
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Sri Lankan Minister of Posts
and Telecommunication Mangala Samaraweera said the ministers
agreed on a comprehensive plan for cooperation in expanding
telecommunications facilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under PAT, telecom tariffs within the SAARC region should be
reduced to the lowest extent feasible within the framework of
cost-oriented intra-regional tariffs. Efforts should be made to
reduce the present intra-regional accounting rates and to utilize
direct links across borders wherever feasible.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan of action, member states should offer
special rates transiting regional traffic and utilize the
facilities of other members for their overflow traffic. The
development of human resources in the telecom sector should also
be enhanced through greater cooperation and better utilization of
the existing training facilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, initiated by Sri Lanka, was attended
by communication ministers from Bangladesh, India, the Maldives,
Nepal and Sri Lanka. Pakistan was represented by the secretary of
the Communication Ministry and Bhutan by a senior official.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks to Join Islamic Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is making fresh efforts for
the membership of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the most
active institution within the Organization of Islamic Countries
(OIC).
</P>
<P>
The new efforts, according to a source in the presidency, are
part of government attempts at widening its scope of friendship
due to the hostile attitude of the European Union (EU) and other
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
It is especially the case when these countries have expressed
doubts over the military government's transition to civil rule
program and the possibility of further sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has remained a full member of OIC since 1986 when the
membership was first revealed. However, it suspended its
dealings with the organization, following the uproar that greeted
the membership, especially from the Christian community.
</P>
<P>
The country has since not initiated efforts to join the IDB
which grants loans and other benefits to members with virtually
no interest in accordance with Islamic injunctions.
</P>
<P>
By obtaining the IDB membership, Nigeria could draw loans from
the bank with less strigent conditions than from other financial
institutions, the source said, quoted by the Guardian on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the present uproar from the Christian community
was uncalled-for since the membership does not change the status
of Nigeria as a secular state.
</P>
<P>
The reactivation of the OIC membership was announced last
March when the Roman Catholic Pontiff Pope John Paul II visited
the country.

<HEADLINE> Syria Voices Pessimism About Peace With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Syria said Sunday it had little
optimism about the possibility of reviving the peace process with
Israel so long as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in
power.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador to the U.S. Walid Al-Moalem made the remarks
in Washington in an telephone interview with the Cairo-based Voice
of Arabs Radio.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is adopting policies that block the Mideast
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed the downcast statement by Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa after his talks with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Washington Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the talks, Al-Sharaa told reporters that "there
is not much optimism" about reactivating the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa called at the U.S. State Department at a time
when the U.S. said that its efforts to broker peace between Israel
and the Palestinians might be grinding to a halt due to Israel's
intransigent stance.
</P>
<P>
Israel's firm refusal to withdraw from 13 percent more of the
West Bank proposed by the U.S. has made the long stalled peace
talks on Israeli-Palestinian track go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Syria has held sporadic talks with Israel since 1991 but the
negotiations broke down in early 1996 without tangible progress on
the two main issues: the fate of the Golan Heights seized by
Israel in 1967, and future bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
No talks have been held Between Israel and Syria since
Netanyahu took office in June 1996 because Netanyahu opposes the
handback of the Golan Heights and wants to restart the
negotiations from scratch while Syria insists on picking up the
negotiations from where it left off.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Cotton Output to Drop by 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's cotton output is
expected to drop by 30 percent in 1997/98 production season,
according to the Tanzania Cotton Lint and Seed Board.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Sunday News quoted the board's General Manager Ali
Nassoro Ngongolo as saying that the cotton output is expected to
drop from 78,048 tons harvested in 1996/97 season to 54,300 tons
this year.
</P>
<P>
Ngongolo attributed the poor harvest to the El Nino-charged
heavy rain starting from late November which has rendered most of
the productive areas unyielding.
</P>
<P>
The planting season of crop is during November and December.
</P>
<P>
He said seeds in most low-lying land have rotten in
waterlogged farms. Floods also washed away the crop in other
farms.
</P>
<P>
Cotton is a major foreign exchange earner of Tanzania,
together with coffee, tobacco, tea, clove, cashew nut and sisal.

<HEADLINE> Feature: HK Residents Vote for First Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents cast ballots
despite torrential rains Sunday to choose members of the first
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 7:30 a.m. against a heavy downpour. Some soaked
election assistants were still soliciting to passers-by and
distributing handouts in the streets. Posters showing the way to
polling stations were easy to see in the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
A man joined an old lady in front of a polling station near the
Victoria Park minutes before the station was opened. The man, a
salesperson, came early to cast his vote before leaving on a
business trip to South China's Shenzhen during the day.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 minutes after its opening, some 30 voters came
to the station and cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
An 85-year-old man who came to a polling station in Causeway
Bay, one of the busiest sections in Hong Kong, at about 8 a.m.,
said: "I'm here to exercise my civic obligation."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ho, who works in a government department, walked to the
polling station together with his mother. He said: "Although it
is raining cats and dogs, I should cast my sacred vote as a Hong
Kong citizen."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the newly elected members of the Legislative
Council will be able to consider the interests of the Hong Kong
people and contribute to the prosperity and stability of the
Hong Kong SAR," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pop star Alan Tam was among the first arrivals to vote at
downtown Wanchai Tower. Tam has been seen on TV for more than a
month to sing the election theme song, "It's My Home," which goes:
"For our home, our future, show your concern and cast your vote."
</P>
<P>
After casting his ballot, Tam told dozens of reporters that the
polling procedure was very simple and convenient and he called on
the voters to exercise their right despite the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and his wife Betty Tung braved a
spatter of heavy rain at 10 a.m. to vote at the St. Joseph's
College polling station before some 50 Chinese and foreign
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Tung remarked, "This is a very important and historic day for
Hong Kong" as the Legislative Council "will be enacting laws,
carefully examining all public expenditure, and also monitoring
the work of the government."
</P>
<P>
The voting "is a very important step in the realization of the
Basic Law and the concept of 'one country, two systems'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the polling station, Lee Bin-yam, a retired businessman
holding a huge umbrella, said that he came to vote because that is
his right as a citizen of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has been calling on the 2.8 million
registered voters to come to vote these days amid worries of heavy
rainstorms around Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The adverse weather did cause problems in Hong Kong,
particularly in the "New Territories" where some villages were
flooded. However, hourly voter turnout rate kept increasing
steadily. By 3:30 p.m., 707,653 people, or 25.32 percent of the
registered voters, had cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Administration Anson Chan paid a visit to the
Media Center at lunch time after casting her ballot. She said
seven polling stations in the North District were affected by the
flooding but "we are arranging, through the Drainage Department,
for the drains to be cleared as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
She added that special transportation will be arranged so that
voters can go to the seven polling stations to vote.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen said after
casting his vote, "We are always hoping for the best."
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council of the HKSAR consists of 60
members, with 20 to be returned through direct election in
geographical constituencies, 30 from functional constituencies and
10 by an 800-strong Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
The polling stations are open till 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting will begin as soon as ballot boxes are delivered
to the Central Counting Station at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The results of the election, the first since Hong Kong's return
to China last July, are expected to be announced late Monday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Nigerian Workers' Burden Heavier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Every productive member of Nigeria's
labor force, either married or single, today averagely supports
three child dependants, according to the the National Planning
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The situation may triple in two years' time if the population
growth remains as high as it is today, the Post Express on Sunday
reported, quoting reliable government sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings of the ministry which is currently
studying the trend of the domestic consumption of petroleum
products, the consumption is determined in part by population
increase but especially by changes in per capita income.
</P>
<P>
The high worker-child ratio being experienced today, the
report said, suggests that more resources such as educational
services would not be available to many children with
corresponding less investment made to develop the productive
sector.
</P>
<P>
The study said that seven years ago, approximately 69 percent
of Nigeria's economically active population aged 15 to 64 which
comprised 31 million men and women who were either employed or
actively seeking employment.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only about three million of these workers
hold paid positions in the economy today.
</P>
<P>
Although a few years back, the labor force was growing by
nearly one million persons annually, the exact rates of
unemployment and underemployment are unknown. But it is widely
agreed that they are high and still rising.
</P>
<P>
On the consumption of petroleum products, the report said,
Nigerians in 1991 consumed 110 million barrels of petroleum while
a proportion of between 150 and 198 million barrels is made for
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum is the mainstay of the Nigeria economy. Oil exports
account for more than 90 percent of the country's total export
earnings and some 40 percent of the total gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that if the oil production increases at an
annual rate of one percent, Nigeria would produce 930 million
barrels by the year 2021.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Witnesses Upsurging TB Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the government efforts, the
incident of tuberculosis (TB) disease, a viral infection of the
respiratory tract, is now on the rise among residents of Lagos,
the largest city in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Today alone, about 3,000 patients had been attended to
although not all are new cases," the New Nigerian reported
Sunday, quoting a hospital source.
</P>
<P>
The source, who serves in one of the two major
government-owned centers for the treatment of TB and other
infectious diseases, could not provide the number of new cases
that were reported in the clinic days.
</P>
<P>
However, he stated that the upsurge in the number of TB cases
is indicative of the fact that the infection is on rampage.
</P>
<P>
According to another source, more people had been coming when
they suspected they were infected and it was discovered that many
of them were sufferers.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Lagos State government announced
that the treatment of TB in the state was free and had ensured a
steady supply of drugs for the free treatment.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were dispensed according to the doctor's
prescription and in line with the stipulation of the World Health
Organization that TB drugs should be given under the directly
observed therapy.
</P>
<P>
The government also rehabilitated the faulty X-ray machines, a
vital equipment in the diagnosis of the ailment in the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo for Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here Sunday morning on a short
visit for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
latest developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will make a comprehensive evaluation of the
current status of the peace process after Israel has rejected a
U.S. proposal on a further redeployment of Israeli troops in the
West Bank to advance its stalled negotiations with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Mubarak will also discuss the coordination between
the two sides as well as among all Arab states in their efforts to
salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently reversed its objection to holding a
pan-Arab summit to discuss the peace impasse. The last Arab Summit
was held in Cairo in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and Presidential Political Advisor Osma el-Baz later joined
the tete-a-tete meeting.
</P>
<P>
Attending the talks on the Palestinian side were Planning and
Internatinal Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath, Local Government
Minister Saeb Erekat and Arafat's Information Advisor Nabil
Aburdenah.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came hours after Mubarak's return Saturday night from
his five-day visit to France, where he and French President Jacques
Chirac called for an international conference on the Middle East
peace to break the long-running deadlock in peace-making.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday after its meeting, the Palestinian
Cabinet hailed the Egyptian-French initiative and called upon the
world community to support it.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side is completely convinced of the importance
of such a meeting at the time when the peace march is dying
because of the intransigent Israeli positions," said Mohamed
Sobeih, Palestine's chief delegate to the Cairo-based Arab League,
in an interview with the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
French officials indicated that the proposed conference would
initially be attended by surrounding countries not at war with
Israel and by outside interested parties such as the major powers.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Israel objected to the proposal of the peace
conference which is expected to help the U.S. to convince Israel
to accept its proposals.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Stock Market in Minor Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Trading on the Zimbabwe Stock
Exchange (ZSE), the second largest one in Africa, started to
improve after some weeks of a bottomed-out index amid high
inflation and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But a bottomed-out index is the dream of most long-term
investors who are expected to take advantage of the rock bottom
prices of the shares by snapping them in their millions and
disposing them off when the prices firm, according to the Sunday
Mail reports.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investors, worried by the huge slump of the
Zimbabwean Dollar, stopped trading a few weeks ago. They had not
started participating by last week and analysts predicted that
they would watch from the sidelines until the situation improves.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said that now it is the time for long-term
investors to buy stock and make money.
</P>
<P>
"It does seem as though we had a very bad run up to about four
days ago. People are just nervous at the moment," ZSE Chief
Executive Tony Barfoot said, adding that "Contrary to press
reports, the foreign investors are still watching from the
sidelines."
</P>
<P>
However, although trading has improved, the gains are still
minimal as in one day last week, the industrial index gained by a
mere 34 points, compared to an average of over 135 points last
year.
</P>
<P>
But the trading condition of the companies is sound and
analysts predict that there would be good opportunities to buy
shares.

<HEADLINE> Another Phase of Job-Cuts Looming in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- As Zimbabwe embarks on the second
phase of economic reforms, union leaders are bracing themselves
for another wave of retrenchments, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Retrenchments have rocked the country over the last seven
years of the Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) which
saw thousands of workers lose their jobs in government, industry,
farming, mining and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of ESAP in 1991, the government has
shed off more than 23,000 civil servants while the construction
industry has laid off a whooping 90,000 jobs during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector lost about 2,000 jobs last year alone while
the General Agriculture and Plantation Workers' Union estimates
that about one million people including workers and their
dependants are going to be affected by the loss of farm jobs, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, over 1,000 employees have been
retrenched so far and the situation, according to some
economists, is not likely to improve in the near future as more
banks are still in the process of negotiating retrenchment
packages.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, which has been hit by a variety of
problems such as cheap second-hand clothes imports, high lint
prices, among others, has so far retrenched over 4,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders and economists remain worried over the paradox
of retrenchments as firms continue to reduce costs by downsizing
in order to remain viable so that they can grow and employ more
people at the end.
</P>
<P>
Economists argue that retrenchments have not only made the
worker redundant, but also affected the family budget while the
government loses a lot of revenue as its tax base is reduced.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese FM Pays Unscheduled Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail arrived in Kuwait late Saturday on an
unannounced visit aimed at improving relations between the two
countries, the official Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Ismail will meet Prime Minister Crown Prince
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdallah Al-Sabah and deliver a letter from
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not mention the content of the letter, nor
did it say how long Ismail will stay in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
This is Ismail's second visit to Kuwait since July 1997 when he
voiced Khartoum's wishes to normalize ties with Kuwait and its
support to Kuwait's independence and territorial integrity, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait lowered the level of its diplomatic relations with Sudan
to Charge D'Affaires after the 1991 Gulf War, during which Sudan
sided with Iraq, while Sudan has since closed its Embassy in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ismail's current visit is seen here as another important step
toward the normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is carrying out a campaign to normalize its ties with
what it described as "enemy countries," which supported Iraq in
the Gulf War sparked by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The countries include Sudan, Yemen, Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Tries to Wipe out Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) have reportedly blocked the rebels of Joseph Kony's Lord
Resistance Army from retreating back to their bases in southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' movement in northern district of Lira and Teso
is a good chance for the UPDF to wipe them out, the New Vision
newspaper Sunday quoted an overseer in the ministry of defense, Major
General Salim Saleh as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am here on the president's orders," Saleh said. "I am also
going to use this opportunity, although a general, to fight
alongside my men."
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who has now moved to Amuria County and closed in on the
rebels, predicted that Kony's rebels will be eradicated soon.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that heavy troops from UPDF's mobile brigades have
been deployed to track the rebels having allegedly camped not far
from Saleh's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The rebels crossed the borders into Uganda recently to get
food and medicine. They looted a medical center and villages,
causing nearly 10,000 people displaced in northern Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Investors Attracted to Hubei Agriculture Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Overseas and domestic investment in
agriculture in central China's Hubei Province is on the rise as
the sector has become increasingly attractive.
</P>
<P>
The province has attracted more than 20 billion yuan from
enterprises, coastal areas and cities in other parts of the
country in the past year, as well as some 400 million US dollars-
worth of overseas investment, to establish 1,100 leading
businesses specializing in agricultural industrialization, and
nearly 1,000 agricultural by-product wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
The Tianfa Group, a listed company, injected 1.4 billion yuan
into developing the rich agricultural sources in the Jianghan
Plain, and also set up eight projects to produce or process farm
produce and by-products.
</P>
<P>
The Chia Tai Group of Thailand invested 240 million yuan to
build chicken farms and fodder plants in Xiangyang County last
year, and met with a positive response from nearly 100,000 rural
families, which raised approximately 100 million yuan for the
effort.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the county cultivated a 10,000-ha maize production
base to feed 300,000 pigs and 20 million chickens annually,
resulting in 50 million yuan in profits to farmers.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian company invested 23 million yuan in Jianli County
to set up a paper mill, leading to the rapid development of a
10,000-ha reed production base.
</P>
<P>
The household responsibility contract system adopted in the 1980s,
featured by family-centered investment, has brought the farmers'
initiative into full play. The present enterprise-based
investment in agriculture in the province, however, is a sign
that China's traditional agriculture is becoming more market-oriented and
stressing high efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: China and Asia New Focus of Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his first official
visit to China, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
his government has decided that China and Asia would be the new
focus of Israel's diplomatic and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Netanyahu said his
upcoming visit to China, which begins on Monday, was "a very
important step in stretching the already strong relations" between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he would discuss with Chinese leaders not only ways of
promoting bilateral economic and cultural cooperation, but also
recent developments in the Middle East and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader said the decision on Asian policies was
made by his ministers at a recent Cabinet meeting, making a shift
to the Israeli policies which have up till now been oriented
strongly to the United States and western Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we must expand our efforts, our concentration, on
China and Asia. It's a new world. We are entering a new
multi-polar world. China is going to be one of the most important
countries, and one of the most important cultures, in this new
era, so we have decided to reck efforts there," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Israeli economic ties, Netanyahu noted that huge
potential exists in enhancing the Sino-Israeli bilateral trade,
economic and cultural cooperation in order to enhance the
friendship of "the two oldest peoples in the world." Israel and
China established diplomatic relationship in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said special efforts could be made to boost
cooperation in especially the agricultural and hi-tech
sectors. Referring to his entourage that includes 13 Israeli
leading entrepreneurs, Netanyahu said that top on the agenda of
his talks with Chinese political and business leaders would be to
lay the ground for significantly increasing the Sino-Israeli
bilateral trade and business relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting the "intelligent and dynamic" efforts China has been
making in seeking modernization and economic development, the
Israeli leader said that Israel is willing to share with China
its experience of achieving great success in developing its
economy, from an agrarian economy to a highly advanced
technological society.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel has developed from an agrarian country to a
highly advanced and industrialized society merely within a
generation, adding that China could do the same in repeating the
economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu proposed establishment of joint ventures in
developing high technologies and agriculture in China.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to use his trip to open up the way for cultural
ties between the two countries by exchanging visits of tourists,
cultural people and even children. He said it is very important
for the two oldest peoples to build a new partnership in a new
era.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay in China, Netanyahu is also expected
to pay a visit to Shanghai, one of China's most modernized and
bustling cities.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Optimistic About Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the relentless deadlock
in the Mideast peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has expressed optimism that a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East would be achieved by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"I am much less pessimistic about the quest for peace (in the
Middle East). I am optimistic. Peace is inevitable," Netanyahu
said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of his first
official visit to China, which will begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is keenly interested in making peace with
all its neighbors, including the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is necessary for our country, for our neighbors. It's
necessary for the region, and I think it's necessary for the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been in a stalemate
since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
And the talks between Israel, on the one hand, and Syria and
Lebanon, on the other, came to a halt in early 1996. The talks
have been stuck over the future of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu defended his hardline policies, which have been
widely accused of causing the impasse in the peace process, by
saying that Israel, as a small country living "in an unstable
region," must have some security arrangements to protect its
people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel's security is the foundation for making
peace with all its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During his upcoming visit to China, Netanyahu is expected to
discuss with Chinese leaders the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is important for China to be acquainted with Israel's views
on the peace process, he said.

LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Endland was held to a 0-0 draw by
another World Cup finalist Saudi Arabia in their last home
friendly before the World Cup here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Each side had the better part of either half with the visiting

Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Daye was the target of Alan

But Saudi Arabia recovered after they came back to the pitch

<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- World Cup finalist Mexico barely
survived strong attacks from Ireland as they drew 0-0 in their
World Cup warm-up match on Saturday in Ireland's capital Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The home side, who did not qualify for the World Cup finals,
had at least four good chances to open the mark, but a couple of
dramatic saves by Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos and some bad
lucks snapped their consistent efforts.
</P>
<P>
Robbie Keane, the unquestionable best player of the match,
missed his last chance in the 83rd minute as his shot slid past
the post.
</P>
<P>
Instead, France-bound Mexico steadied themselves after
thrashing by Norway on Wednesday.

Squads:
</P>
<P>
Ireland: Given, Fleming, Breen, Babb, Harte, Kelly (captain),

BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China has
fired more than 2,000 policemen since a law enforcement campaign
began in March, aiming to improve the public security sector's

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder (5): Hong Kong - Int'l Shipping, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong maintained its position
 as the world's busiest container port for six years in a row in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Including container terminals, mid-stream and river trade, it
handled 14.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of
containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent, by weight, of Hong Kong's external trade is
handled by the port, according to Hong Kong's Port Development
Board (POB), which forecasts that, with the economic and trade
development of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has
to cope with a steady growth of container cargo well into the 21st
 century.
</P>
<P>
A new container terminal, Container Terminal 9, is expected to
be completed in the early 2000s, which will expand substantially
the handling capacity of the existing eight container terminals at
 the Kwai Chung/Stonecutters Island Container Port.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work continued on both the new River Trade Terminal
at Tuen Men and the Permanent Mid-stream Facility at Stonecutters
Island. Both facilities are due to come into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
The throughput of the Hong Kong container port is forecast to
grow on an annual average of 5.8 percent in the next 10 years to
24 million TEUs in 2006, and Hong Kong will retain its role as the
 major container port for import and export to the Chinese
mainland, according to the latest findings of the Hong Kong Port
Cargo Forecasts commissioned by POB.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hong Kong remains a prominent center for
ship-owning, ship-financing and ship-management. Latest figures
from the Hong Kong Shipping Register showed that a total fleet of
486 vessels, amounting to 6.13 million gross registered tons
(GRT), were registered under Hong Kong flag.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also stands as the hub of international and regional
aviation, with the status certainly to be enhanced by the
forthcoming opening of the new international airport at Chek Lap
Kok.
</P>
<P>
Having served Hong Kong for several decades, the existing Kai
Tak airport has been lauded as one of the safest and most
efficient airports in the world. In the financial year ending
March 31, 1997, the passenger throughput at Kai Tak grew by 7.5
percent to over 30 million while air cargo throughput jumped by
9.8 percent to over 1.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kai Tak overtook Tokyo Narita to become the world's
busiest airport in terms of international cargo. In respect of
international passengers, it remained the third busiest after
London Heathrow and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate continued robust growth in air traffic, the
20-billion-U.S. dollar Airport Core Program was started in the
early 1990s. The world-class infrastructure project consists of
10 projects: the new airport, the airport railway, roads, bridges
and tunnels and even a new town.
</P>
<P>
Upon opening on July 6, with the first of the two runways in
operation, the new airport is able to handle 35 million passengers
 and up to 3 million tons of air cargo annually.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder (4): Hong Kong - Int'l Trading Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong economy is highly
externally oriented and dependent on trade with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The city was placed the world's eighth largest trading entity
in 1997 by the World Trade Organization (WTO), accounting for 3.6
percent of world total trade.
</P>
<P>
The value of Hong Kong's total merchandise trade amounted to
3,071 billion HK dollars (393.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or
around 230 percent of the GDP for the year.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that Hong Kong's position as an international
trading center has been well preserved after the handover. The
Basic Law guarantees continuation of Hong Kong's economic and
trading system, the free movement of goods and capital and its
status as a free port and separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional document of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China also provides that Hong Kong may
continue to participate in relevant international trade
organizations and agreements. Hong Kong is now a member of the
WTO, the World Customs Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 witnessed modest export growth of Hong Kong.
Government figures showed that the value of total exports in the
whole year of 1997 stood at 1,455.9 billion HK dollars (186.6
billion U.S. dollars), up 4.2 percent over the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports made up 85 percent of the value of total export,
reflecting the continued importance of Hong Kong as an entrepot
for China's mainland, Hong Kong's number one trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports in 1997 was 1,244.5 billion HK dollars
(159.6 billion U.S. dollars), 5 percent higher, while the value of
 domestic exports, at 211.4 billion HK dollars (27.1 billion U.S.
dollars), dipped slightly by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports rose by 5.2 percent to 1,615.1 billion HK
dollars (207.1 billion U.S. dollars). Therefore a visible trade
deficit of 159.1 billion HK dollars (20.4 billion U.S. dollars),
equivalent to 9.9 percent of the value of imports, was recorded
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland accounted for one-third of Hong Kong's
total merchandise trade, followed by the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Dampened by the regional financial crisis and a major downturn
in the tourism industry, Hong Kong's export of services showed
almost no increase in 1997 against the previous year, following an
 8.6 percent increase for the whole of 1996.

NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Forty people have died so far due
to blistering heat wave sweeping India in the past couple of
weeks, press reports said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The past week saw New Delhi, capital of India, battling it out
under the scorching sun on the one hand and the power supply
playing truant on the other. Adding to the misery was the heat
wave conditions and temperature spiraling to a whopping 44.6
degrees centigrade, an all time high in the month of May in the
past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures soared in more regions in the country as the long
heat wave has thrown normal life out of gear, confining people
indoors. Shops and business establishments remained closed and
roads presented a deserted look in most states.
</P>

While three deaths from sunstroke, along with several
hospitalized, were reported in West Bengal, three people died in

<HEADLINE> 400 Thai Vocational School Teachers to Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 teachers will become the
first batch of private vocational school teachers to lose their
jobs due to the economic slowdown, according to the Private
Vocational School's Association of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Veerawat Wanasiri, president of the association, was quoted
Sunday by the Bangkok Post as saying that 397 vocational school
teachers from among 17,000 schools nationwide will lose their jobs
when the new school season starts on June 1.
</P>
<P>
He said, the redundancy has been made necessary because of a 30
percent drop in student enrollment this year from that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The number of teachers to be made redundant could have been
higher had the schools not employed other measures to alleviate
the hardship, Veerawat said.
</P>
<P>
He said several of the schools, mostly small and medium size,
have been having problems.
</P>
<P>
Prathuang Wipastawat, principal of the Chamni Technology
School, said only 150 new students have applied for enrollment
this year although he had expected about 500.
</P>
<P>
A total 10 percent of the school's 750 students have dropped
out and 50 percent of the remaining students had no money for
tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
He said his school is considering laying off some teachers
because of the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Commission on
Elections (Comelec) on Monday will partially proclaim some winning
senatorial candidates in the May 11 elections in which half of the
24 seats in the Senate were also at stake.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec, acting as a National Board of Canvassers, will
determine on Sunday who among the senatorial bets now in the
winning column will be included in the partial proclamation,
Comelec officials said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The poll body will also determine who will be excluded on the
ground that their final standings could be affected by the results
of the special elections which will be held on May 30 in at least
700 precincts in six provinces.
</P>
<P>
Failure of elections was earlier declared by the Comelec in
these precincts due to hostilities among political parties, ballot
box snatching, wide-spread violence, shortage of official ballots,
and the refusal of election officials to report for poll duties.
</P>
<P>
Comelec officials said senatorial contenders, whose lead over
the candidates outside the top 12 is more than 250,000 votes, will
surely be included in the partial proclamation as they will no
longer be affected by the results of the May 30 special polls.
</P>
<P>
Those who can still be overtaken by other candidates in the
coming special elections in six provinces will be excluded from
the partial proclamation.

SAN JOSE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of mobile telephone
users in Costa Rica will be more than 100,000 by the end of this

BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The 38-billion-U.S. dollar Mergers
between Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp has sent few ripples
through foreign car circles in China, but has sounded a wake-up
call to the nation's fragile automotive industry, China Daily
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
"The deal indicated that economic globalization is speeding up
and the trend towards mergers is becoming a tidal wave reshaping
the whole industry, which has given a shock to our previous
mind-set." said Huang Jinhe, vice-president of the China First
Automobile(Group) Corp.
</P>
<P>
"If China joins the World Trade Organization, tariff reductions
on imports would have an unprecedented impact on our national
industry," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested large domestic auto manufacturers accelerate the
pace of reform and forge alliances as soon as possible to stand up
to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
"Only through mergers and acquisitions can China' auto sector
realize economies of scale, lower production costs, improve
quality and develop more products," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"The government should also formulate favourable policies to

<HEADLINE> China to levy Inheritance Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Inheritance has traditionally been
a family's internal affair, but it will soon become a public issue
with the introduction of inheritance duty, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Listed in the government work report delivered at the First
session of the Ninth National People's Congress in March this
year, tax on inherited property is expected to make its debut
within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the country's sustained and rapid economic growth,
some Chinese residents have amassed a significant amount of
personal assets.
</P>
<P>
"The time is ripe for China to levy inheritance taxes," said
Liu Zhuo, deputy director of the Research Institute of Taxation
Science under the State Administration of Taxation(SAT).
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of such a tax will fill gap in China's
taxation system."
</P>
<P>
SAT has submitted reports on the subjects to the State Council,
China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are several million Chinese families
with assets exceeding one million yuan(119,000 U.S.dollars). The
net income of a host of families has surpassed 10 million yuan or
even 100 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Income Gap Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- In stark contrast to the old
egalitarian distribution structure, Chinese residents are seeing a
growing gap between rich and poor as the market-driven economy
penetrates citizens' lives, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Gini Coefficient, an international index used to measure
income distribution, stood at 0.292 in 1997, an increase of 0.012
from the previous year, said Wang Rendai, deputy chief of the
household survey division of the Urban Social-Economic Survey
Organization under the State Statistics Bureau(SSB).
</P>
<P>
She said the bigger the Gini Coefficient, the greater the
income disparities in a country.
</P>
<P>
"The current difference in residents' incomes is normal, even
if it develops a little further."
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate the top 20 percent of families accounts for
34 percent of the total income in 1997-- one percentage point more
than in 1996. The bottom 20 percent families only recieved 11
percent of total income, down one percentage point from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The average incomes of the wealthiest people more than
quadruple those of the poorest at present. In 1990 they earned 2.9
times as much, while in 1985 they only earned 2.3 times more.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predict that the wealthiest group will enjoy
average income five times those of the poorest by 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Senator Tom Daschle, leader of
the Senate Democrats since 1995, said Saturday that he will seek a
third term in office.
</P>
<P>
The Senate minority leader made his official re-election
announcement to a group of people in his hometown of Aberdeen,
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
"It's important to take South Dakota's values to Washington,
and I'm trying to reflect those values in the years that I've
served in Congress," the Associated Press quoted Daschle as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important thing I take to Washington is an
appreciation of the need for hard work, keeping your word, helping
others, and that, in essence, is what I learned right here in my
hometown," he said.
</P>
<P>
Daschle, 50, said protecting medicare and social security,
helping business compete in a new global economy and working to
save family farms would be among his goals if re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Three Republicans meet June 2 for their party's Senate
nomination and the right to challenge Daschle in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
Daschle has no opposition in the primary. He served four terms
in the House before defeating then-Senator Jim Abdnor for the
Senate job in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Del Piero Almost Sure For World Cup Despite Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero was
almost certain to recover from injury in time for next month's
World Cup in France, an Italy squad physical trainer said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vincenzo Pincolini, the physical trainer at training camp
outside Florence, rated Del Piero's chances of missing out on the
World Cup as "about 10 percent".
</P>
<P>
Pincolini was reacting to reports in the Italian press which
said Del Piero would struggle to recover in time from the thigh
strain he injured Wednesday night when Juventus lost to Real
Madrid of Spain in the European Cup final.
</P>
<P>
"Del Piero finished the match on Wednesday in Amsterdam. In
this situation I don't think you can talk about an alarm that he
might miss the World Cup," the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
"The risk that he may not recover is about 10 percent. And
there is no risk of a recurrence, in my opinion," Pincolini added.
</P>
<P>
The probability of Del Piero being available increased when
Cesare Maldini announced Del Piero will be called to the training
camp on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Maldini also said he was putting Parma striker Enrico
Chiesa on standby just in case, dashing the last chances of
Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola and his coming clubmate Pierluigi
Casiraghi, who is on the verge of leaving Lazio.
</P>
<P>
Chiesa, 27, made an impression while winning his first cap at
European championship in 1996 in England but has since failed to
make the Italy team.

<HEADLINE> Iran Beats Inter 4-1 in World Cup Warm-up Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran put its World Cup warm-up
campaign firmly back on track under new coach Jalal Talebi on
Saturday by beating UEFA Cup champions Inter Milan 4-1 in a
friendly in Como, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Serie A runners-up Inter was without most of its internationals
including Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, but much of its
first-choice defence was on display for a defeat that would do
Iran a power of good after last Monday's 7-1 drubbing by AS Roma.
</P>
<P>
Inter took the lead through its Uruguayan forward Alvaro Recoba
but, to the joy of the 1,000 Iranians in the 2,000-strong crowd,
Iran equalised through midfielder Kian before pulling strongly
away with a double from Ali Daei and one from his strike partner
Karim Bagheri, who is trying to recover match fitness before the
World Cup campaign.
</P>
<P>
Iran's warm-up program for its first World Cup appearance in 20
years was jolted by the crushing defeat by Roma, which led to the
dismissal of national soccer coach Tomislav Ivic of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Soccer officials in Tehran named former Iranian international
player Talebi to replace Ivic in the run-up to next month's
matches against the might of Germany, Yugoslavia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Talebi is Iran's third coach this year. Brazilian Valdir
Vierra, the manager who took Iran to the World Cup in the tense
play-off against Australia last November, was sacked in January.

NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- India's premier Bombay Stock

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder (6): Hong Kong - Regional Information, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, the regional entrepot
of finance and trade, is marked by the high degree of import and
application of advanced technology, particularly that related to
information industry.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of its status of free port, Hong Kong
maintains economic links with over 100 countries and regions,
making it a pivot of information, and now it is trying to build
itself into "the most informed city in the world" as described by
the Hong Kong Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Wired by satellite, optical fibers, cables, microwaves and
other media, Hong Kong has formed an information network,
particularly economic information network, both locally and
globally.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the first major city in the world to have a fully
digitized telephone network and the amount of its outgoing
international phone calls is much higher than both the United
States and Japan. Hong Kong now has a telecommunications network
comprising over 300,000 kilometers of optical fiber.
</P>
<P>
About one-sixth of Hong Kong's population or 1.1 million people
have subscribed to paging services -- the highest per-capita rate
in the world. And a total of over 1 million subscribers to
cellular phone services also is among the highest levels of
penetration in the world.
</P>
<P>
A recent market survey showed that the home penetration rate of
PC is over 50 percent and there are more than 850,000 Internet
users in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In March, the world's first-ever interactive TV (iTV) was
launched in Hong Kong, making it possible for people to see films,
listen to music or deal with financial affairs at any time with
clicks of a few buttons at home. And just two weeks ago, the
Internet service was added to the iTV network, enabling users to
get access to the worldwide web at a surprisingly high speed.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on the future of information and
communications technology in Asia had just concluded in Hong Kong.
Organizers of the conference said the city provides a dynamic,
technology-rich environment, whose government sees technology as a
critical component of Hong Kong's successful future. Also, the
regional hub provides an open location in which to examine the
various models of technology throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, Hong Kong has brought in U.S. and Japanese
investment in electronic industry, which has become the second
largest industry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Technology advancement is a key factor of economic growth in
Hong Kong. A research on the manufacturing sector in Hong Kong
shows that technology development accounted for an average of 42.9
percent in the sector's production during the period of 1969 to
1982.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's technology development is market-oriented and
characterized by high efficiency. For instance, it usually takes a
mere three months for general electronics and plastics from
product design to production.
</P>
<P>
There are several prestigious academic institutions in Hong
Kong, including Hong Kong University, the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and
they are well equipped and have absorbed talents from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Political and social stability ensures Hong Kong favorable
working and living conditions. In addition, Hong Kong's ability to
develop technology-rich products has been well-complimented by
the abundant outcome of the ever-increasing scientific research in
China's inland areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, a small region of less
 than 1,100 square kilometers inhabited by six million people, has
 developed into an economic powerhouse despite its lack of natural
 resources.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong economy has nearly quadrupled over the past two
decades, with its GDP growing at an average annual rate of about
seven percent in real terms. The World Bank has ranked Hong Kong's
 per capita GDP, in terms of purchasing power parity, the sixth
highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong holds the world's third largest foreign exchange
reserves, after Japan and China's mainland. Its foreign currency
assets totaled 92.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a small and open economy, Hong Kong's economic success owes
a great deal to the remarkable performance of its external trade
sector.
</P>
<P>
It is the world's seventh largest trading economy, and the U.S.
 Heritage Foundation has named Hong Kong the freest economy in the
 globe for four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has established itself as a major international
financial center. It is the world's fifth largest banking center
in terms of the volume of external banking transactions, and the
fifth largest foreign exchange market in terms of turnover. Its
stock market is Asia's second largest in terms of market
capitalization and ranks the seventh in the world. Hong Kong is
also the world's fourth largest gold bullion market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has emerged as Asia's services hub, with exports of
services ranging from accounting and legal services, to insurance
and fund-raising, and telecommunications and media.
</P>
<P>
Low tax rates, a level-playing field, rule of law, clean
government, free flow of information, free market competition, and
 efficient infrastructure have all contributed to the success of
Hong Kong economy.

<P>
XINING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- With the melting of ice and snow
in the Yushu grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the rare
black-necked cranes are coming back to their usual home for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
At least 127 the world's rarest birds have been spotted in the
area in northwest China's Qinghai Province in recent weeks. The
world has only less than 1,000 birds of the kind, according to
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) sources.
</P>
<P>
The wetland and marshes of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
provided the treasured birds with adequate natural food.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 kinds of wild birds take the area as their
paradise so as to go there annually. International
environmentalists regard the Yushu grassland as one of the best
habitats for the black-necked cranes.
</P>
<P>
China approved of the establishment of a national nature
reserve at Longbaotan in Yushu in 1986 and the Qinghai provincial
government designated the black-necked crane as the bird of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The country invested more than one million yuan (about 120,000
U.S. dollars) in building fence of the reserve and observation
posts, said Mao Yusheng, a local official who is in charge of
agriculture and animal husbandry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More incentives have been offered
to foreign businessmen to encourage them to invest in the
economically backward central and western regions of China,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, director-general of the Department of Foreign
Investment Administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (Moftec), said that a number of large-scale
agricultural, infrastructure and environmental protection projects
in these regions will be given priority in the search for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Matching funds will also be channelled into those projects by
the central government, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
With the central government's approval, specific permission can
be given for foreign investment in industries that fall into
sectors where foreign investment is normally restricted.
</P>
<P>
The ceilings on joint-venture shares held by foreign investors
and limitations on market access may be eased in these
regions. Tariffs for imports of capital goods by foreign investors
may also be waived if the industries in which they invest are
recognized as those encouraged by the State.
</P>
<P>
Another stimulus will be the establishment of pilot joint
ventures in the wholesale and retail, foreign trade and travel
sectors in the hinterland's provincial capital cities. Specific
regulations relating to these pilot joint ventures will be made
public soon, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes Nearly 1,000 Psychological Consultation Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 psychological
consultation agencies have been established nationwide and
psychological consultation has become part of the expenditure on
health for many Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhongshun, a psychological specialist, said that as
Chinese people face much more pressure when the planned economy is
transferring to a market economy, the consultation service is
booming catering to the social needs.
</P>
<P>
Chen, having opened China's first privately-run
psychological-aid hot line in Tianjin 11 years ago, said a survey
indicated that 12 to 15 from every 1,000 people suffer from
psychological problems to various extent in China.
</P>
<P>
He said, the psychological presure comes from troubles in
employment and competition at work posts as well as mental
conflicts in marriage and love affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past 11 years, over 100,000 people sought his
help via his hot line. With his efforts, more than 180 people gave
up their suicide attempts.
</P>
<P>
Chen said, China's psychological consultation agencies are
divided into two kinds. One is for face-to-face consultation which
focuses on treatment of psychological barrier cases and the other
focuses on offering effective aid to those who are in
psychological crisis triggered by marriage or other affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen said though the psychological service has initially taken
shape, personnel in the field is still in great demand. In China,
every 1 million people only has less than three psychological
doctors, far lower than that of in other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese psychological experts are calling on universities to
train more personnel in the field.

<HEADLINE> China Searching for Intact Flying Tiger Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The only remaining intact airplane
of the Flying Tiger Air Squadron is thought to be at the bottom of
a lake in southwest China's Yunnan Province, according to an
investigation group here today.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team, organized by the China Expedition
Association, hopes to find the missing plane in Dianchi Lake, on
the outskirts of this provincial capital, in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Flying Tigers, led by US Gen. Claire Lee Chennault,
supported the Chinese army and people against the Japanese
invaders during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The squadron, based in Kunming, destroyed more than 300
Japanese airplanes in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
Visiting China last October, some former Flying Tiger pilots and
relatives of pilots said that one of the Flying Tiger airplanes
dropped into Dianchi Lake.
</P>
<P>
The fighter plane, No. 68 crashed into the lake on a routine
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing of this from the visitors, the China Expedition
Association, which has a particular interest in recovering old war
relics, then enlisted the support of radar experts and frogmen
</P>
<P>
Radar monitoring found metal objects in the lake, which could
be the remains of the plane, according to the search team.

<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake with an
estimated preliminary magnitude of 6.4 on the Richter scale hit
the southern Philippine island of Mindanao early Sunday morning,
the Philippines' seismology authorities said.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of damage and casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the
quake occurred at 1:44 a.m. local time and was centered 57
kilometers southwest of Cagayan de Oro City, capital of Misamis
province.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said they were not expecting any damage from the
quake, caused by a movement of the Cotabato trench, located under
the sea along the western coast of Mindanao. They expected some
aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is located in what is known as the Pacific
"Ring of Fire" where powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

<HEADLINE> China Wins Uber Cup Badminton Finals for Sixth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China lifted the Uber Cup for a
record sixth time after beating defending champions Indonesia 4-1
in the 17th world women's team championships final here Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
It was a successful comeback for Chinese, five consecutive time
winners from 1984 to 1992, who had finished runners-up to
Indonesia in the past two championships.
</P>
<P>
China's world number one Ye Zhaoying defeated world number
seven Susi Susanti 11-9, 10-11, 11-5 in the opening singles match
and top-ranked Chinese doubles pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun downed
Indonesians Rosiana Zelin and Indarti Isoliana 15-7, 15-1 in the
following doubles.
</P>
<P>
China's world number three Gong Zhichao, 20, was the player of
the day after she scored a come-from-behind victory over
10th-ranked Indonesian Mia Audina in the second singles.
</P>
<P>
Gong battled one hour and 17 minutes for the 9-11, 12-10, 11-4
victory in the third match of the final, giving China the
unbeatable 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Audina had beaten Gong twice in their three
previous meetings since December of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Audina, Olympic silver-medalist from the Atlanta Games, came
from behind at 6-4 to win the first game 11-9. Gong rallied
strongly to take the second after lagging behind 10-7, with superb
volleys and drops.
</P>
<P>
Numerous errors cost Audina badly in the decisive game, which
helped Gong lead throughout the game to a 11-4 win.
</P>
<P>
A new Indonesian combination of Eliza and Denyana Lomban came
from a one-game deficit to win over China's world number two duo
Qin Yiyuan and Tang Yongshu 5-15, 15-11, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
And fifth-ranked Dai Yun sealed up the Chinese victory by
defeating her 32nd-ranked Indonesian opponent Meiluawati 11-3,
11-6 in the evening's closing match.
</P>
<P>
"All the first two singles players from both China and
Indonesia demonstrated world's top-class performance today. Susi
Susanti and Mia Audina performed very well in this major
tournament, but our players did even better," said China's head
coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
"Ye Zhaoying has improved a lot, both mentally and technically,
since the last championships, but she still made more errors than
Susanti today. Ye had to further improve her play," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Gong Zhichao was in high morale today, with improved footwork
and flexibility on the court. But she had failed time and again to
unleash killer shots, which would be among her major weak points,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese head coach played down the importance of Ye's
win over Susanti. He reminded those at the press conference that
the Indonesian ace was still the one to watch out.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time for Ye to beat her," he added.

<HEADLINE> Irish Republic Votes by 95 pct for N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republic voted by 94.4
percent in favor of the North Ireland peace deal in Friday's
referendum, according to final results announced in Dublin on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Dublin said taken along with the figures for
Northern Ireland, which voted more than 71 percent in favor, the
total "yes" vote for the island of Ireland was over 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the parallel referendum on the same day, the people in the
Irish Republic were asked to vote on changing the constitution to
renounce Ireland's territorial claim on Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Irish Premier Bertie Ahern welcomed the result of the first
all-Ireland vote for 80 years. But he warned groups trying to
wreck the agreement they would have no chance.
</P>
<P>
"To those who would engage in violent opposition to the
agreement and what it represents, I would say to them -- forget
it. The people on whose behalf you claimed to act have spoken.
Your ways are the ways of the past."
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews also commented positively
on the referendum results, saying people on both sides of the
border had clearly voted for a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement proposes maintaining Northern Ireland's
links with Britain while building closer ties with the Irish
Republic through a joint ministerial council.

<HEADLINE> Blair Hails N. Irish Vote as "Giant Stride" to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Saturday welcomed the endorsement of the peace deal, describing
the referendum result as "a giant stride along the path towards
peace and hope."
</P>
<P>
He said it was "a day for joy" and that the vote in favor of
the historic deal included a "pretty clear" majority of unionists.
</P>
<P>
Voters in Northern Ireland endorsed the historic peace
agreement in Friday's referendum with a resounding majority of 71
percent, official results showed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Blair told reporters at Chequers, his country home northwest of
London, that he believed "this is another giant stride along the
path towards peace and hope in the future."
</P>
<P>
"There's still a very great deal more to do. It is a big step,
and a very welcome one, but there's still a long way to go. But at
least we're getting there," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He added the task now was to "overcome the doubts and
misgivings" of those who had voted against the pact and to build
the confidence needed to make a success of the power-sharing
assembly and cross-border institutions envisaged by the deal.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to do that, the future for Northern Ireland could
be tremendous in terms of investment and jobs, of peace,
prosperity..." Blair said.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was approved in the referendum, Northern
Ireland will quickly move to elections in June for the 108-strong
assembly to govern local affairs.

<HEADLINE> Irish Police Intercept N.Ireland-bound Bomb-Carrying Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two cars that contained bomb-making
equipment was intercepted by the Irish police Saturday while on
their way to Northern Ireland, according to a BBC television
report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Irish police sources, the report said that the vehicles
were stopped north of the strongly republican town of Dundalk,
County Louth, near the Irish border, by members of the Irish
emergency response unit.
</P>
<P>
"On checking the cars they (the police) discovered what
appeared to be a large quantity of home-made explosives," said
Detective Superintendent Michael Finnegan. "Both boots were full,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The two drivers of the cars, both from Dundalk, which is only
16 kilometers from the Northern Ireland border, have been arrested
and are being held in the police station of the town.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened only several hours after voters in
Northern Ireland voted 71.1 percent in favor of the peace
agreement reached on April 10 to end 30 years of violent conflict
in the disputed British-ruled province.
</P>
<P>
A BBC correspondent said it was believed that the two men may
be dissidents opposed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that dissident republicans in three groups
opposed the peace process for its failure to remove British rule
in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blames School Shootings on Violent Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Saturday blamed a string of deadly school shootings on "a
changing culture" of violent movies and video games that teach
children they can lash out with guns without punishment.
</P>
<P>
"We must face up to the fact that these (school shootings) are
more than isolated incidents," Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
"They are symptoms of a changing culture that desensitizes our
children to violence," the President said, pointing out that most
teen-agers have seen hundreds of murders on television, in movies
and in video games before they even graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Congress to pass his juvenile crime bill, which
includes a provision banning violent juveniles from buying guns
for life.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a 15-year-old boy fired a semiautomatic rifle in a
high school cafeteria at Springfield, Oregon, killing two students
and wounding 22 others. The suspect, Kip Kinkel, also is accused of
shooting his parents to death in their home.
</P>
<P>
In a series of school shootings since last October, 14 teachers
and students have died and about three dozen have been injured.
All of the accused have been boys ages 11 to 18.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the startling similarity of the incidents left him
"profoundly troubled."
</P>
<P>
While urging Congress to approve his anti-crime bill, Clinton
called for a nation-wide action to deal with school violence.
</P>
<P>
"We must all do more... to teach our children the unblinking
distinction between right and wrong, to teach them to turn away
from violence, to shield them from violent images that warp their
perceptions of the consequences of violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that adults should do more to
recognize the early warning signals that deeply troubled young
people send before they explode into violence.
</P>
<P>
"Surely, more of them can be saved and more tragedies avoided
if we work at it in an organized way with sensitivity and firm
discipline,"

<HEADLINE> Irish Voters Say Yes to EU Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Voters in the Republic of Ireland
Saturday approved the European Union's (EU) Amsterdam Treaty with a
medium-sized majority, according to official results of a national
referendum held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The results revealed that some 61.7 percent of Irish people voted
for the EU Treaty, while 38.3 percent voted against the Treaty, which
is designed to propose closer integration within the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Irish Minister of Education Michael Martin told the Irish national
television Saturday evening that the referendum result is "a
substantial triumph."
</P>
<P>
However, the turnout rate at 56.2 percent of its 2.8 million
voters could not be regarded as high enough as many Irish people
complained that there had not been enough information on the
implications of the Amsterdam Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Treaty, which was signed at last October's EU
summit, must be ratified by all 15 EU members before coming into
effect.
