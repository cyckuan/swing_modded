TASK FORCE QUESTIONS CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Some members of the task force seeking a home for a
new Arizona Cardinals stadium say it's time for the team to answer
the multimillion dollar question:
</P>
<P>
   How much will the team put up?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phoenix are hoteliers are up in arms over reports
that the panel is eyeing a new hotel-motel bed tax to raise public
funds for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, appointed by Gov. Jane Hull, began talking about
financing for a proposed $329 million stadium last week. But some
members say their recommendations hinge on how much public money
will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody will know that amount until the Cardinals and the NFL
disclose how much they plan to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a number that doesn't exist,'' said Robert
Fannin, a Phoenix attorney on the task force. ``It's kind of hard
to come up with a number when we don't know what the team will come
up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Task force member C.A. Howlett, an America West senior vice
president, said the atmosphere will be ``fraught with suspicion''
if the panel arbitrarily recommends public and private funding
levels without knowing how much the team and the league will ante
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the committee to be of value to the governor and
the Legislature, the committee needs to make recommendations which
are fair to all parties,'' Howlett said. ``The only way to make
fair decisions is to have adequate, accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   Howlett already has asked for projections showing how much money
the Cardinals would earn from a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Developer David Beckham, another task force member, said the
panel also is supposed to learn at its next meeting, scheduled for
next Thursday, Dec. 16, how certain Arizona taxes compare with
those in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals public relations director Paul Jensen said Wednesday
that team Vice President Mike Bidwill thinks it is ``premature to
get specific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too many variables in the air,'' Jensen said,
including the site and type of stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we'll do the right thing,'' he said. ``The
Cardinals are committed to being a major contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   The team committed $75 million to Rio Salado Crossing, a
proposed stadium and convention center rejected by Mesa voters
earlier this year. The NFL said it would have allocated about $25
million to the cost, a commitment that would probably remain the
same, said Ted Ferris, Hull's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants told the task force last week that private funding,
on average, accounted for 29 percent of construction costs in 14
new NFL stadiums. Public funding supplied the rest. But Ferris said
that won't be acceptable to Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to have to be more private money,'' Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that, based on a cost of $329 million, the
Cardinals would have to spend more than $75 million to make a
stadium deal fly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public portion of the financing, Hull has said she
wants the panel to focus on user fees, such as sports ticket
surcharges, and specialized taxes, such as a bed tax or a rental
car tax.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris reiterated Wednesday, Dec. 8, that Hull will not consider
a general tax increase to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   But tourism officials said Wednesday that the local hotel
industry is in an economic slump and unprepared to pay a new tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members certainly are not supportive of a tax to pay for a
Cardinals stadium,'' said Debbie Sweeney, executive director of the
Valley Hotel and Resort Association. ``There's no benefit to them
paying for a Cardinals stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   During meetings this week, Ferris discussed a proposal to pour
more money into state tourism promotion activities, using some of
the money raised by a new hotel bed tax.
</P>
<P>
   David Flack, a Scottsdale resort manager who is vice president
of the resort association and a member of the Arizona Tourism
Alliance, said such a plan makes the bed tax ``more palatable, but
it doesn't make it a slam-dunk by any stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, he said, hotel bookings through October were down
7.5 percent, compared with last year. Most hoteliers don't think
the industry is healthy enough to take on an added burden.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has complained for several years that Arizona's
tourism promotion lags behind other states, but the Legislature has
not responded with extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McDermott, director of the Arizona Office of Tourism, said
this year's budget is $8.8 million, with the national average being
$10.8 million. Arizona, he said, spends about half what the top 20
tourism states spend on average.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Hotel &AMP; Motel Association is meeting next week to
hash out its position on the issue. Executive Vice President
Michele Eckert said only one thing is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern about any increase in the bed tax,'' she
said, ``in an economy where the hotels are having a tough year.'' &QL;

TEXAS FLIES MURDERER FROM INTENSIVE CARE TO EXECUTION CHAMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs 15th graf to identify Ray Sullivan) 
 (DW) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With several high-profile death penalty cases in Texas
in coming weeks, the execution of a convicted murderer, David
Martin Long, was not expected to generate much fanfare. He had been
scheduled to die by lethal injection Wednesday evening, making him
the 32nd person executed in Texas this year.
</P>
<P>
   But when death row guards found him unconscious from a drug
overdose on Monday morning, Long himself became a high-profile
case. Placed in intensive care on a ventilator in a Galveston
hospital, Long suddenly presented a politically delicate question
for Gov. George W. Bush, even as he campaigned for the Republican
presidential nomination in New Hampshire:
</P>
<P>
   Would the state of Texas remove an inmate from intensive care so
that he could meet his date with the executioner rather than stay
the execution for 30 days? The answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court's rejection Wednesday of Long's final
petition for a delay, Texas officials Wednesday evening to
transported him to the death chamber in Huntsville for execution.
Because Long's doctor deemed such a move ``risky,'' state officials
apparently used an airplane staffed by medical personnel to ensure
that he arrived in good health after the 25-minute trip. With Bush
out of state, the decision on Long's fate Wednesday night
technically fell to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, but Bush's spokeswoman
said the governor agreed the execution should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch advocate of the death penalty in a state that strongly
shares the same view, Bush has made no pretense of extending his
campaign theme of compassionate conservatism to death row. But the
Long case and other upcoming cases might present politically
ticklish moments for Bush as death penalty opponents try to paint a
grim picture of the system in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday for example, the state is scheduled to execute
another convicted murderer, James L. Beathard, whose accuser has
recanted and whose original lawyer now admits he had a conflict of
interest. In January, three inmates who committed homicides as
juveniles are scheduled to die. That same month, Johnny Penry, a
convicted murderer who is considered mentally retarded, is
scheduled for lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases challenge our assumption of the death penalty as
fairly and justly administered,'' said Maurie Levin, executive
director of the Texas Capital Defense Project, a nonprofit group
that helps death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, which leads the nation with 195 executions since 1982,
public support for the death penalty is very high, and Bush's
Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, also was a strong advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The Long case, however, has presented very unusual
circumstances. Convicted of the 1986 hatchet slayings of three
women, one of whom was blind, Long ingested an overdose of
anti-psychotic drugs on Monday morning. Doctors in Galveston placed
him on life support and found themselves in the odd situation of
trying to restore to good health a man with only two days left to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander Duarte, the physician in charge of the case, said
Long, 46, was removed from the ventilator on Tuesday, and by
Wednesday his condition had improved to serious from critical.
Duarte said Long still required oxygen and continual medical care.
Under normal circumstances, he said, he would likely keep Long in
the intensive-care unit for another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Duarte said state officials asked him to sign an
affidavit stating that Long could be safely transported to
Huntsville, a request he said he refused. But Duarte said he signed
an affidavit that stated Long's health had improved, that he had
suffered no seizures and was responding to questioning _ but that
transporting him could be risky without appropriate medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Long's lawyers argued before a state court judge Wednesday
afternoon that their client was no longer competent enough to be
executed. Lawyers for the state Attorney General John Cornyn argued
the opposite, and Judge Edwin V. King agreed.
</P>
<P>
   With that, and rejections by the Supreme Court (a 6-3 vote) and
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (a 4-3 vote) Long's appeals
were all but exhausted. Earlier in the week, the state Board of
Pardons and Parole had rejected his clemency application. So his
last chance was the governor. With Bush in New Hampshire, Perry
rejected Long's request for a 30-day stay of execution. Under Texas
law, when the board rejects clemency, the governor has two options:
reject clemency or grant a 30-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just delay the execution 30 days?
</P>
<P>
   `` Long has been convicted of three murders,'' Ray Sullivan,
Perry's spokesman, said. ``The Texas Department of Criminal Justice
determined that transporting him from Galveston to Huntsville is
not life threatening. He has received his court appeals, and
barring any additional court actions, we expect the execution to go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Long's lawyers, John Blume disagreed. ``It seems like a
pretty sick process when you jerk a guy out of intensive care on a
ventilator,'' he said, adding, ``What's the huge rush?''

CITY COUNCIL HEARS FROM THE CITIZENS ABOUT WTO POLICE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 and KERY MURAKAMI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Hundreds of people packed the downtown library
Wednesday night to vent anger, frustration _ and to shed tears _ a
week after Seattle police launched their last round of tear-gas at
demonstrators opposed to World Trade Organization policies.
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of the poor planning that marked the city's response
to last week's events, the City Council failed to anticipate the
turnout. More than 400 people showed up, but only 150 could get
into the meeting room. Several hundred stood outside in the rain,
listening to testimony over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the overflow, the Council will hold another hearing
Tuesday in a much larger room at the Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not in attendance Wednesday night was Mayor Paul Schell, who has
said he is well aware the police response to the demonstrations was
deeply disappointing in a laid-back city that prides itself on its
history of peaceful protests. Damage from the demonstrations has
been estimated at $3 million, with $12 million to $22 million in
lost sales. More than 500 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Council President Sue Donaldson said she discouraged Schell from
attending the public meeting, saying the Council wanted to review
the events independently.
</P>
<P>
   Each comment Wednesday night added a new wrinkle to the heavy
criticism the Schell administration and Police Department face. And
many of the points raised will be examined the Council, mayor's
office, and the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Conlin and others said it's clear that last
week's incidents remain a major concern. He noted that council
members have received 6,000 e-mail complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's open-microphone hearing was intended as a way
to begin a healing process, and council members said it was a
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the traditional activists that we see. It's
broader than that,'' said Councilman Nick Licata.
</P>
<P>
   In small ways, things seemed back to normal in the city that
values process in public debate. Protesters on Wednesday night
weren't controlled by pepper spray or tear gas, but by City Clerk
Theresa Dunbar's small sign advising speakers of a three-minute
limit.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council first heard from those involved in planning the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dolan, deputy director of Public Citizen's Global Trade
Watch Program, an environmental, agricultural and faith-based
group, said he wanted to dispel suggestions that police were misled
by protest organizers who promised peaceful actions.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ruckus Society organizers made clear their goal was to
shut down the WTO, and said only a naive police department would
think that meant using only ``clever signs and powerful chants,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seattle Police Department was not sucker-punched,'' he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary McQuie, of the Direct Action Network, which helped
organize peaceful protests, said that Assistant Police Chief Ed
Joiner assured her before the WTO meeting that he understood Indian
independence leader Mahatma Ghandi's non-violent protest tactics
and promised to wait until television cameras arrived before
ordering mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the police shot tear gas before there was any
property destruction,'' McQuie said.
</P>
<P>
   Joiner has said tear gas was fired to try to open a corridor for
WTO delegates and others trying to reach the Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   After gas was used, McQuie said, Asssistant Chief Harv Ferguson
said he considered linking of arms to block a street was a violent
and illegal tactic _ contradicting what Joiner had said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed a complete lack of understanding of Ghandian
principles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all speakers were opposed to police. Katherine
Coatsmilanoski said tactics of protesters also must be examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really what I expected,'' she said of the hearing. ``A
group whine on the side of the protesters. I saw protesters
spitting on the police ... and screaming obscenities at them. Maybe
it was non-violent, but if you saw that happening to a son or
daughter or a brother or sister you would have wanted to go down
there and kick a protester's ass.''
</P>
<P>
   D.Jennifer Whitney, a massage therapist who organized medical
workers to treat injured protesters, said reports that there were
no serious injuries were untrue. She said her volunteers pulled
glass out of the eye of a protester whose gas mask had been
shattered by a rubber bullet, witnessed dozens of serious asthma
attacks, and watched a man with multiple sclerosis in a wheelchair
shot with tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's demonstrations, area hospitals reported only
a few dozen injuries, most of them from tear gas and rubber
pellets. No deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
   She and others also questioned if military-grade tear gas, used
when police supplies ran out, had more serious and perhaps
neurological side effects. Like others at the meetings, she
demanded police give a complete accounting of the chemical agents
used.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Judd, executive secretary of the King County Labor
Council/AFL-CIO said that he considers police to be workers, and is
torn about criticizing their response. But he said police ``seemed
to be out of control'' during the protests. And like dozens of
others at the meeting, he said he couldn't understand why city
officials and police failed to anticipate events ``when we told
them this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schulman, a member of the Seattle Commission on Sexual
Minorities, said, ``my friends were tear-gassed on the streets, in
restaurants and in their own apartments'' during protests in the
Capitol Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said he was sitting in a Capitol Hill restaurant when
the tear-gassing started and, ``The owner locked all the doors and
turned off the lights, presumably because he was afraid the police
were going to attack the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Cato said her husband was trying to get home when he was
stopped by police while walking through Pike Place Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Can I get by? I'm going home.' He got about 10 feet
and he had tear gas dropped at his feet,'' she said. ``I had to go
pick up a very angry and agitated man. We're both incredulous about
why that happened. It's bad enough that happened to peaceful
protesters, but for that to happen to someone trying to get home is
just disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The most raucus cheers came when speakers called for the
resignations of Schell and City Attorney Mark Sidran, who has been
criticized for backing strict ``civility laws'' governing public
conduct, but who was not involved in WTO protest management.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Norm Stamper was in command of the police, and has
said he will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Schell shouldn't let Stamper be his fall guy, because
he's just as responsible,'' said a woman who identified herself
only as Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   While dozens of speakers raised specific complaints Wednesday
night, many also spoke of a broader sense of loss and a feeling
that democracy itself had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants described how they were suddenly confronted with
hordes of people banging on their windows and threatening
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost over $10,000 in business,'' said Dan Hogan of his
downtown establishment. ``Even worse, we lost faith in our city
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Kamai summed up the testimony of many, saying ``In a real
sense, an honest innocence was stripped from our city _ not by
protesters, not by police in riot gear, not by clouds of tear gas _
but by the failure of people in whom we, the citizens of this city,
place our trust and confidence.''

CALIFORNIA'S MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER, AND CANDIDATES KNOW IT, BIG
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 15th graf to correct spelling of Khachigian)  (bl)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it the fire wall, the big state where Al Gore
and George W. Bush must stop any serious challenge to their
presumptive nominations for president.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the harbinger, the bellwether state where Republicans
and Democrats will first face each other on a single ballot in a
sign of their comparative appeal to the November electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the riddle, the sprawling state in which new electoral
rules and a speeded-up calendar make the usual dubious predictions
doubly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody in the political world seems inclined to call the
March 7 California presidential primary anything but important.
</P>
<P>
   In both parties, that contest will decide about 20 percent of
the delegates needed for the nomination, and the leading candidates
all have Californians in crucial roles in their campaigns. They all
have spent substantial time in the state, not only raising money
but also showing the flag in visits of up to 10 days at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, they all may be braving the winter rigors of Iowa
and New Hampshire, but come February, all hope to be here for
reasons considerably more compelling than their health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two ways of looking at California today,'' said
Gale Kaufman, former Sen. Bill Bradley's senior campaign adviser
here. ``That it's a really big state, and it's really, really
important, or that it's a really big state, and it's really, really
important after Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the polls show Bush with more support here among
Republican voters than all his Republican rivals combined and Gore
with more than twice the level of Democratic support that Bradley
draws. But the experts agree that those numbers could change
quickly, depending on what happens in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, for the first time next year under a new system
passed by voters here, the presidential candidates in California
will compete in a blanket primary, in which the names of all
candidates will appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and
voters of any party may choose anyone they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``So even if one or both of the nominations has been settled by
California, there's an incentive for the nominee to work California
really hard to make that good showing,'' said Dan Schnur, a veteran
California Republican worker who is communications director for the
campaign of Sen. John McCain, whose best hope is that a strong
showing in New Hampshire might help him raise enough money to be a
viable competitor here in his neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   In a further wrinkle, because the rules of both national parties
have long required that convention delegates be chosen solely by
party members, primary voters in each congressional district will
be asked to use computer-coded ballots specifying their party. That
way, the overall vote can be broken down by party for purposes of
selecting delegates. That conceivably means that one candidate _
say Bradley, with his potential appeal to crossover voters _ could
win more total votes than Gore, while Gore won the partisan contest
for actual delegates, sending a mixed message on a day when voters
in New York, Georgia, Ohio and most of New England will also choose
delegates. (On the Republican side, the winner of the most
Republican votes takes all a state's delegates, while Democratic
rules divide them proportionally.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have Bradley and McCain finish one and two over all
and the other two finish three and four, but win the delegates,''
said Bill Carrick, a leading Democratic consultant here who gets
calls seeking advice from both the Gore and Bradley campaigns. ``I
don't know. That would be a meltdown in pundit-land, in which
they'd all say, `Now, to the definitive results in the Georgia
primary.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These days, the candidates are mostly conspicuous by their
absence, as Californians, not especially attentive to politics even
in the heat of campaigns, focus on the coming holidays and the
contenders work the coffee shops in colder climes. But their
campaigns are buzzing below the radar with varying degrees of
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, the McCain camp announced that it had added
Ken Khachigian, a California Republican strategist who has worked
on seven presidential campaigns dating back to Richard M. Nixon. On
Friday, the Bush campaign officially opened its statewide
headquarters in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore has locked up the support of most
of the state party establishment, and a major health-care workers
union, but some of his supporters worry that his operation here has
not been as vocal or as visible as it should be, compared with
Bradley's, which has offices in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los
Angeles and is led by Ms. Kaufman, a longtime Democratic consultant
who has scored some major successes in union campaigns in recent
years. Bradley's national campaign manager, Gina Glantz was raised
and cut her teeth in New Jersey politics, but for more than a
decade has lived in San Francisco, before leaving to run Bradley's
presidential campaign from its New Jersey headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's point person in California is Kathy Bowler, who has been
the executive director of the state Democratic Party and, until
recently, was still working out of the party's offices in
Sacramento. But she has now established a Gore 2000 office there,
and another is to open soon in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common complaint here about the Gore campaign from Day 1
has been that there was not enough of a physical presence on the
ground to keep people feeling tied in, and as if they were an
integral part of the campaign,'' said Garry South, the senior
political strategist for Gov. Gray Davis, who long ago endorsed
Gore. ``I think everyone involved is aware of that. Part of the
problem has obviously been that the Gore campaign was spending
money at too rapid a pace, and nobody wanted to spend any more here
right now. But this is California, and this is really the fire wall
for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore staff members say they have suffered from comparisons with
President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, when he ran
unopposed in the primaries and state party money helped pay for a
network of offices around California.
</P>
<P>
   They say that they fully expect Gore to ``become a resident'' of
California by February, as one senior aide put it. The campaign's
national press secretary, Chris Lehane, said Gore was positioned
``very well in California,'' because his policies on such issues as
opposition to further offshore oil-drilling, support for gun
control and abortion rights ``translate into good politics in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   South, the California governor's adviser, said he was hopeful
that the Gore forces would soon step up their efforts, but there is
some irony in his complaint, since Gore has taken particular pains
to woo California, which Clinton reclaimed for the Democrats in
1992 and which remains vital to any Democratic strategy for
retaining the White House. As vice president, Gore has visited the
state more than 60 times and named a former California congressman,
Tony Coelho, as his national campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But both Bradley and Bush have been outpacing Gore in
fund-raising in the Silicon Valley, and in Hollywood, prominent
Bradley supporters like the entertainment moguls Barry Diller and
Michael Eisner have done much to take the shine off Gore's support
from other stars and executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The twin pillars of Bill Clinton's support here have always
been Silicon Valley and Hollywood, and neither of those communities
has been terrifically enthusiastic about Al Gore,'' said Schnur,
the McCain adviser who was a senior aide to former Gov. Pete
Wilson. ``So what do you have left? Gore's running a campaign
oriented toward the traditional Democratic constituencies'' like
labor, minorities and women. ``He's running an organizational
campaign in a state that isn't very organizational.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bradley made a great show last summer of
taking a 10-day tour of the state, talking casually with
grass-roots groups in an effort to introduce himself, and although
his aides profess success in drawing volunteers, their candidate
has hardly surged in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last guy who said he was going to spend a lot of time and
meet people in California was Al Checchi,'' said Kam Kuwata, a
senior adviser to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, recalling the maverick
millionaire businessman who staged an expensive but spectacularly
unsuccessful race for the Democratic nomination for governor last
year. ``He did nothing but go around the state for a whole year,
and met several thousand people. Well, several thousand people is
nothing in this electorate. And I don't think even presidential
primary voters here will be tuned in until after the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the conventional wisdom here is that the only way to run
statewide campaigns is with widespread television advertising. But
the rates are so high _ about $1.5 million to run an advertisement
that would be seen 10 times by a typical viewer _ that no one here
expects candidates to go on the air until a couple of weeks before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to see one of those campaigns where you've got
the bio ad and the issue-framing ad and you run five ads before you
get around to doing anything,'' said Carrick, the consultant. ``It
will be the opposite of Iowa and New Hampshire: short on
organization and long on whirlwind media campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, California held its primary in June, and once upon a
time it was pivotal. But in recent years, the accelerated national
primary schedule left California an afterthought, so the state
moved up the date, first to late March and then to the beginning of
the month, only to find other states leapfrogging as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already seen the impact,'' said state Sen. James Brulte,
a Republican from San Bernardino County who recently stepped down
as state co-chairman of the Bush campaign, with the candidate's
encouragement, to become finance chairman of the debt-ridden state
Republican Party in an effort to build its ability to compete next
fall. ``Candidates have been crisscrossing the state for months.
It's no coincidence that George W. picked California as the venue
for announcing not only his first major education speech but his
first foreign policy speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate impact remains anybody's guess. In the words of
Davis' strategist, South: ``This is really terra incognita.''  &QL;

5 DEALERS HELD IN SALE OF BASS FROM POLLUTED WATER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of pounds of striped bass illegally caught
in polluted waters have passed through wholesalers at the Fulton
Fish Market to ``prominent and elegant'' Manhattan restaurants and
private clubs in recent years, federal authorities said Wednesday
after filing criminal charges against five fish dealers involved in
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began a year and a half ago based on a tip
that an Edgewater, N.J., fisherman routinely sold striped bass
caught in the lower Hudson River near the George Washington Bridge,
a practice banned 23 years ago because of contamination by
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   The fisherman, Ronald O. Ingold Sr., pleaded guilty to the
illegal fishing charges late last year, and investigators have
since determined that for at least three years he sold his illegal
catch directly and indirectly to five New York fish wholesalers:
Marlen Fish Corp., M.V. Perretti Corp., M. Slavin &AMP; Sons, Gotham
Seafood Corp. and F. Rozzo &AMP; Sons Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities did not disclose the total amount of fish
involved, or the restaurants that bought and then served the
potentially contaminated fish. But they said that during the spring
of 1998 alone, about 18,100 pounds of the striped bass illegally
caught by Ingold's company passed through the Fulton Fish Market in
Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said Wednesday that tests of four samples of
the illegally caught bass turned up low levels of PCBs that did not
exceed the federal safety standard, meaning they were not
considered dangerous. Ann Rychlenski, a spokeswoman for the
Environmental Protection Agency, said that even if a person
unknowingly ate one of the contaminated fish, it would not
necessarily pose a health threat.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan alleges that an employee at two of the Fulton Street
wholesalers _ Marlen Fish and Perretti _ knew the striped bass came
from the lower Hudson River, while at least two executives at the
other companies were aware that the fish they were buying did not
have the proper tags to document that it was legally caught.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and city officials, as well as several prominent New
York restaurant managers and chefs, expressed surprise that
wholesalers as large and prominent as Slavin &AMP; Sons were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for seafood is so high right now, people are
cutting corners,'' said the general manager of the Oyster Bar,
Michael Garvey, who added that he was confident his restaurant, in
Grand Central Terminal, did not sell the illegal catch because it
accepts only properly tagged striped bass. ``But the regulations
are in place for a reason and we should abide by them. We should
not be doing this as an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingold, who has yet to be sentenced on the criminal charges, has
long fished the lower Hudson for shad, which can be harvested there
because they spend a short time in the river and do not feed during
that time. Wednesday's criminal complaint says that when his nets
brought in striped bass along with the shad, he would label them as
shad, but sell them to Marlen Fish and Perretti for about $1.25 a
pound, a higher price than normally paid for the more common shad.
Perretti and Marlen then sold the fish to other wholesalers for as
much as $2.50 a pound. By the time it reached restaurant plates in
Manhattan, it was being offered for as much as $36 an entree, the
complaint says.

OLD SKIING GEAR RECEIVES A SECOND LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is that time of year when new equipment begins showing up on
winter slopes. But what happens to all the old gear: the snowboards
with last year's nicks, the skis that look like narrow lumber next
to the new curved shapes and the poles so heavy they feel like
hammers?
</P>
<P>
   Some people get rid of them _ for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   SnowSports Industries America, a national trade group, has
organized a program in which ski shops accept used equipment as a
charitable donation. The gear is then shipped to three collection
centers for subsequent distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Carroll, a hard-goods buyer at Paragon, a sporting goods
store in New York City, said: ``It costs us some money to implement
the program in the first place. But it gives us a chance to try and
do a good deed, and also to try and drive customers into the
store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Donate-A-Ski/Board program began Oct. 16 with a kickoff by
Billy Kidd, the 1964 Olympic ski champion who is director of skiing
at Steamboat Springs, Colo. The program ends Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Special Olympics, an organization Kidd often
works with, charitable organizations that work with disadvantaged
youths will receive the used gear.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Mattie, the donations program director, said recently
that more than 1,000 skis and 215 snowboards have be- en collected
since the October kickoff. Poles, boots and other ski accessories
are also being accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we get some awful gear as well as gear that's
hardly been used,'' Mattie said. ``But we get the bad stuff out of
the pipeline, which is probably good for safety purposes. Some of
the gear we can use for parts to fix other equipment. The rest of
it we recycle, and some goes in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   People who drop off equipment at a participating ski shop
receive a receipt _ the donations are tax deductible _ based on the
type and age of the gear they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curley, owner of Inverness, a ski shop in Waitsfield, Vt.,
said he collected about 175 pairs of skis and 200 pairs of boots so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Avery Harper of the chain called Peter Glenn of Vermont, said
people seem grateful to have a place to pass off their old
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resale value of skis is worse than a car,'' Harper, who
runs a Vermont store in Atlanta, said. ``So people sit on it, but
the equipment does absolutely no one any good in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Vallin, co-owner of the Scandinavian Ski &AMP; Sports Shop in
New York, agreed. Customers in the city complain about a lack of
storage. ``They don't know what to do with their old equipment,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one ski shop owner has gleaned an unexpected benefit
from the donation program. Bob Bergstrom, owner of Boarderline and
Sports Ltd., two stores in Woodland Hills, Calif., said one
customer brought in a vintage pair of Head skis, one of the first
companies in the 1950s to begin using steel in making skis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These skis have a lot of nostalgia, so we have them on
display,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

program, check www.snowlink.com on the Internet.

CLINTON HONORS NUN FOR AIDING REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NED KILKELLY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monday was a whirlwind day for Sister Jean Marshall,
a Dominican nun from the Bronx. She flew to Washington, had lunch
at the State Department, then went to the White House to receive
the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was back to normal. She juggled phone calls,
scheduled meetings, worked on several grants that are due next week
and ate half a sandwich at her desk at St. Rita's Center for
Immigrant and Refugee Services, which she founded 16 years ago to
help the Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrants then flooding the
borough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a teacher for 21 years, and found that people were
picking food out of the garbage,'' she said from her office
Tuesday. ``I dropped everything and decided to go into refugees
service. I didn't know a thing. I had to learn everything. Now we
have people from eight different countries speaking eight different
languages.''
</P>
<P>
   What St. Rita's does, Sister Marshall said, is help recent
immigrants and refugees ease the transition from a life on the run,
often in wartime, to life in a new country that to them seems to
offer nothing but promise.
</P>
<P>
   They come to St. Rita's for English classes, legal and medical
services, employment counseling, preparation in becoming citizens
and after-school and youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at the White House on Monday, Clinton said Sister
Marshall and St. Rita's has helped ``thousands of refugees, from
Vietnam to Cambodia to Bosnia, to find jobs, learn English, live
better lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marshall was one of five Americans on Monday to receive
the Roosevelt award, established last year by the president in
honor of Eleanor Roosevelt's commitment to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   St. Rita's, which has 15 full-time and 12 part-time staff
members and an annual budget of $450,000, runs five offices: three
in the Bronx, at Theodore Roosevelt High School, Walton High School
and the main site in the Fordham section; one in Astoria, Queens,
primarily for Bosnians; and one in the Brighton Beach section of
Brooklyn, which focuses on aiding Russians.
</P>
<P>
   About 525 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, who arrived in New York
after the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia, have passed through
St. Rita's since July, Sister Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   About 450, she estimates, remain in the Bronx, living, working,
going to school. While they required the same help as other
immigrants, the Kosovars came with a difference, Sister Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian Kosovars had no lead time, they came right from a
war to our shores,'' she said, adding that while many are well
educated, ``the frustration is translating those skills to learning
English'' and finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to take time, but they feel fortunate to be here.
They never stop talking about it. They are very anxious to work.''
</P>
<P>
   With the excitement of meeting the president and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton _ who promised to visit St. Rita's, but
didn't say when _ still fresh in her voice, Sister Marshall
returned Tuesday to the ever-present chore of raising money. ``It's
a constant uphill battle to survive,'' she said about the center,
which runs on a mix of public and private grants. ``We've been cut
a lot of money this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the center's financial woes, Sister Marshall said, is
the cutting of federal money to assist refugees, which has trickled
down to state and city contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she expressed hope that Monday's award ``would help
spread the word about what we're doing to help these people.''

NETS TOP BUCKS, 107-90 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With just over seven minutes left in
Wednesday night's game, the New Jersey Nets' Stephon Marbury drove
the ball along the left side of the baseline and challenged three
Milwaukee Bucks to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   The players went airborne and Marbury, the shortest of the
bunch, flew underneath the rim while cradling the ball. As the
defenders began to descend, Marbury released a reverse layup that
bounced off the backboard and then through the hoop for a dazzling
basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of play that forces opposing coaches to call
timeout, and Milwaukee's George Karl, his club down by 15 points
and all but done, did just that. While the Nets ran to their bench,
Keith Van Horn grabbed Marbury from behind in a jubilant bearhug
and screamed praise into his ear. As Marbury smiled, it seemed as
if all the trials and turmoil that engulfed this franchise over the
first month of the season had been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, losers and pouters through the bulk of their first 17
games, look different now. On Wednesday night, they rolled, 107-90,
over a tired but talented Bucks team to win their second straight
game for the first time this season. The victory improved their
record to a still horrific 4-15, but their collective attitude is
no longer so sullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that comes about when you start winning,'' Van Horn said
of the Nets' camaraderie and exuberance. ``There's no dislike in
this locker room. I think it was just the fact that we were losing,
and losing is tough. Everyone's frustrated and it's hard to have a
smile on your face and have a great conversation with someone when
you're losing. Now that we're winning and things are going good and
people are starting to play good, the whole mentality has
completely shifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The mind-sets are not the only things that have changed for the
Nets. For the second time in two games _ they played exceptionally
well in upsetting the powerful Sacramento Kings, 109-95, on Monday
_ the Nets exhibited great ball movement, chemistry, mental
toughness, defense and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, playing his best ball of the season, was superb,
recording 25 points, 14 assists, 3 steals and only 1 turnover while
making 10 of 16 shots from the floor. He shattered the homecoming
plans of the former Net Sam Cassell, who two seasons ago helped
lead the Nets to one of their finest seasons. Cassell brought
averages of 19 points and 9 assists, but had only 10 points and 5
assists with 6 turnovers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell's troubles began right away as he committed two
turnovers in the first two minutes. Following its point guard's
lead, Milwaukee, playing its fourth game in five nights, committed
five turnovers in its first nine possessions. The Bucks also missed
their first eight shots, allowing the Nets to build a 16-2 lead in
under six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Marbury playing the playmaker's role to perfection, Kerry
Kittles putting all of his varied abilities on display, and Van
Horn finishing strongly around the rim, the Nets pushed the lead to
22 points in the second quarter. The Bucks surged at the end of the
third, pulling within 8 points entering the final period, but
Marbury took over.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to the basket almost exclusively, the Nets' point guard
scored 6 points and passed for 2 assists in a 13-6 run that ended
with his splendid reverse layup. Van Horn, shooting 7 for 13 in
making more than half of his shots for the second straight game,
followed Marbury with 20 points. In his finest game to date,
Kittles filled the box score with 18 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists
and 3 steals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Nets, who entered shooting a league-worst 39.9
percent, made 48.1 percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost so many games this year that we have nothing to
lose,'' Kittles said of the Nets' improved play. ``We're just going
out and playing hard and letting it go. When you play that way, you
play loosey-goosey and with more confidence. And when you play with
more confidence the offense flows, the defense flows and you win
more games.''

`IT'S OVER' FOR INJURED BARKLEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JONATHAN FEIGEN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The echoes from his standing ovations had barely
died down. Charles Barkley could no longer hear them. In the quiet
of the visitors' locker room, he wiped his tears, called his wife,
Maureen, and simply said, ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's legendary NBA career came to a crashing end Wednesday
in the city where it began.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:09 remaining in the first quarter of what turned out to
be an 83-73 loss to Philadelphia, Barkley fell hard beneath the
Houston Rockets' basket, rupturing his left quadriceps tendon.
Barkley said the injury would end his celebrated 16-year NBA
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Barkley said. ``I guess the big fella in
the sky is saying he wanted me to finish where I started. I'm
saddened and disappointed it happened. It's ironic it happened
tonight. A lot of people here saw me play my first game. Now they
saw me play my last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed emotion. I cried a little. A lot. I'll probably
cry again. Sometime late tonight, sitting in my hotel room. I have
to realize it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia team physician Jack McPhilemy said the injury would
``conservatively'' require six months of rehabilitation after
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, 36, announced before the season that this one would be
his last and said the injury would not inspire him to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think ... it was supposed to happen here, it's supposed
to end in Philadelphia,'' Barkley said. ``I'm not going to be
stubborn and think I'm coming back. I think in my heart God sends
us subliminal messages. I think in my heart it was supposed to end
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but 16 years of great memories. I've been all
over the world. I've met the best actors in the world, the best
athletes in the world. I've met presidents, met Bishop (Desmond)
Tutu. I've met regular people who made a great impact on my life.
I've exceeded all my expectations. I never expected to accomplish
all the things I did the last 16 years. I have no sadness in my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was honored before the game. He was presented with a
LeRoy Neiman print, begun 12 years ago but left unfinished until
last week, depicting Barkley with the 76ers, the team he says he
will represent when he is inducted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley received his third standing ovation of the night, a long
but almost solemn salute, late in the first half when he limped
back to the Rockets' bench using a crutch and with his leg
immobilized by a splint. He received his fourth standing ovation in
the second half when he was presented with a card, a replica of the
poster given fans before the game, that had been signed by Sixers
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley spent the rest of the game sitting on a chair behind the
Rockets' coaches, joining huddles during timeouts but never seeming
to recapture his usual emotion and sometimes dropping his head into
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third quarter, however, he was back to his
accustomed role coaching the Rockets' young guards.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had jumped to challenge a shot by the Sixers' Tyrone
Hill, falling hard on the miss. Barkley stayed on the floor as if
he knew the severity of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, this happens with a sudden, violent contraction
of the quadriceps muscle, such as a jumping motion,'' McPhilemy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when it happened,'' Barkley said. ``When my kneecap was
buzzing through my leg, I said, `Well, it's been fun. It's over.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was dead serious wrong. I knew I wasn't ever
going to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   With his mother, Charcey Glenn, and grandmother, Johnnie Mae
Mickens, who were guests of the 76ers at the game, around him,
Barkley was told almost immediately that the injury was
season-ending and under any circumstances would be
career-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had suffered a strained quadriceps muscle to his left
leg in Monday's game against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was averaging 15.9 points and 11.4 rebounds, tied for
fifth in the league, this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also glad my last game in Houston was good,'' Barkley said
of the Rockets' win on Monday in which Barkley had 25 points and 11
rebounds. ``It's their last memory of me. I played really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, twice a member of gold-medal-winning Olympic Dream
Teams, was named one of the NBA's 50 greatest players in 1997. He
was the league Most Valuable Player in 1993, when he averaged 25.6
points and 12.2 rebounds, taking the Phoenix Suns to the NBA
Finals, where Barkley was denied his only shot at an NBA title by
the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he became only the third player in NBA history to
surpass 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists, joining
Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite standing just 6-6, Barkley led the league in rebounding
in 1986-87, when he averaged 14.6. He was second in the NBA in
rebounding last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tremendous,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``He
was one of my favorite guys when I was a scout. I love his
enjoyment of the game. As a player, he's just great. Tremendous
accomplishments. He was very good for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A nine-time All-Star, Barkley averaged 22.2 points and 11.7
rebounds in his 16 seasons. Going into Wednesday's game, he was
averaging 16.7 points and 12.3 rebounds in his three-plus seasons
with the Rockets. They acquired him from Phoenix in a trade for Sam
Cassell, Robert Horry, Chucky Brown and Mark Bryant on Aug. 19,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen me grow from a boy to man,'' Barkley said. ``I've
done some good things, some great things, some stupid things, like
everybody. I helped the league grow. Now the young guys need to
step up.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Sixers players and coaches, including
former teammate Maurice Cheeks, rushed to Barkley to say a few
words. Barkley then made his way to the locker room, stopping to
find someone to hold his crutches, so he could sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team after the game _ appreciate,'' Barkley said.
``Being a professional athlete is the greatest thing in the world.
This can happen every single night you play. You should appreciate
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Barkley, there will be no more.

RANGERS NIP OILERS IN OVERTIME, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coach John Muckler termed the New York Rangers' 2-1
overtime victory over the Edmonton Oilers at Madison Square Garden
on Wednesday night their most emotional performance of the season.
And the Rangers' usually mild-mannered goaltender provided the most
memorable moment of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were talking about Mike Richter's pugnacious
performance long after Adam Graves had deflected a Kevin Hatcher
backhander past Tommy Salo at 3:15 of overtime. Graves' eighth goal
of the season - which was originally credited to Hatcher - gave the
Rangers their second overtime victory in as many games, and a
four-game unbeaten streak (3-0-1), a new season-high.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, on the other hand, provided his teammates with plenty
of laughs to go along with his 37 saves. And that was because
Richter uncharacteristically jumped Alexander Selivanov with 3:18
remaining in regulation and pummeled Selivanov with his blocker
after Selivanov had run Richter over.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an uncharacteristic outburst. There was Richter,
firing at least five rights to the back of Selivanov's head, after
Selivanov had hit the far (left) post with his head after running
into Richter. Selivanov had also absorbed a Mathieu Schneider
cross-check to the neck, seconds before he collided with Richter,
one that Schneider was going to be penalized for before the melee
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had Lefebrve, John MacLean, the goal-post, the ref,
the ice,'' said Richter, when asked if any of his punches had
connected.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that was true, Richter's pugilistic pursuits
delighted the Garden crowd, which chanted Richter's name as the
officiating crew was trying to sort all the penalties out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That blocker hurts, I know that,'' said Graves, when asked if
he would give Richter any fighting advice. ``It's not very often
you see him angry like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have told him to uppercut with that blocker,'' said
Rich Pilon, whose defensive partner, Hatcher, has enjoyed something
of a resurgence since Muckler paired him with Pilon. ``I'd like to
have one of those things in a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided fisticuffs overshadowed Graves' game-winner, which
soured a 33-save performance from Salo, who with Richter, provided
most of the highlights of the night. It also overshadowed Theo
Fleury's first goal in over a month, which snapped a 12 game
goal-less drought.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury had scored just one goal in his last 19 games. The
12-game drought tied the second longest of Fleury's career,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau. That was during the 1991-92
season and Fleury finished with 33 goals. In 1989-90, Fleury's
first full season in the National Hockey League, he went 16 games
without a goal and finished with 31.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty this season might be tough. Coming into Wednesday night,
Fleury was on a 15-goal pace.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old right wing had last scored on Nov. 5, in
Colorado, when he steam rolled Patrick Roy on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of tactic was not necessary on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kim Johnsson _ the impressive rookie defenseman _
created a turnover at his own blue line, breaking up pass by Roman
Hamrlik. Johnsson passed to Fleury, who flew down right wing toward
Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury snapped a wrist shot from the edge of the right circle.
Salo attempted to make a sliding save. Instead, the puck found its
way through Salo's five-hole at 3 minutes 18 seconds of the second
period. And Fleury had finally scored another goal, just his sixth
this season, coming in the Rangers' 28th game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised it went five-hole, because I wasn't shooting
there,'' said Fleury. ``I was trying to go far side.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury had plenty of other chances on Wednesday night. He fired
a team-high 8 shots on goal. But Salo stopped 7, including a
breakaway with just under eight minutes to go in regulation, when
Fleury's shot bounced off his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just fanned on my shot in the third,'' said Fleury. ``I
didn't get it up high enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As many chances as Fleury had, Edmonton's Ryan Smyth had more.
He threw a game-high 10 shots on goal. And Smyth _ who was in
Richter's face all evening _ evened the game at 4:31 with his 12th
goal of the season, by jamming a pass from Todd Marchant past
Ricther from just off the right post.
</P>
<P>
   But Richter _ who stopped Doug Weight on a breakaway as Weight
tried to beat him five-hole with a minute and a half remaining in
regulation _ did not allow another shot to get past him. He even
won a fight.
</P>
<P>
   And so the 10-14-4 Rangers, who finished off a span of five
games in eight nights, can now head into a week-long break on their
highest note of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dead tired,'' Muckler said after his Rangers had just
eked by an Edmonton team that has won once on the road this season.
``We need a rest. And it's a well-deserved rest.''

COMMENTARY: VICTIMS OF THE `GREAT GAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: subs 7th graf to change `drive up the price' to `keep up the
price'; subs 8th graf to remove `this weekend'; in list of 7
reasons near end, subs reason number 3 to include reference to
economic inaction)  
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The newly emboldened Russian military has now
embarked on a modern version of what Rudyard Kipling in 1901 called
``the Great Game'' _ that struggle against the West for economic
and political power in the Caucasus and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   A war on terrorism out of Chechnya is its excuse. Next week's
elections to the Russian Parliament are the immediate cause of the
systematic massacre of the dark-skinned Muslim troublemakers. The
blood-thirstiest of the Russian politicians are getting the most
support, if we can believe the easily rigged polls.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, longer-range game afoot. That is the old
imperialist urge by Moscow to dominate the sources and lines of
supply of Caspian Basin and Iranian oil and gas, and thereby to
gain a stranglehold on the economic life of its adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   A map tells the story. Chechnya lies astride one of the key
pipelines into Russia and out to a Black Sea port through Turkey's
Bosporus to the Mediterranean. That's why Moscow says it must be
denied independence, no matter how many die.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, aware of Russia's ambitions, is encouraging
an alternative to supply lines through Iran, Iraq and Russia. We
support a proposed energy trail through Azerbaijan, Georgia and
Turkey. Although it has not happened, President Clinton said
Wednesday it would be seen as ``one of the most important things
that happened this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is putting great pressure on Georgia, independent after
the breakup of the Soviet Union. Adjacent to Chechnya, Georgia has
been resisting occupation by Russian troops who want to take charge
of its border; that would undermine the West's proposed pipeline.
Georgia's reformist president, Eduard Shevardnadze, has survived
three assassination attempts that many think were KGB-inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow recently entertained Tariq Aziz, Saddam Hussein's man. In
return for Russia's support in resisting U.N. inspection of its
nuclear weapon development, Iraq has cut its permitted production
of oil. That has helped keep up the price of oil _ it has doubled
this year _ and has given Russia the money it needs to support
100,000 troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the undercurrent events. On the surface, residents of
besieged Grozny, the Chechen capital, have been ordered to get out
of town lest they be pulverized by bombs _ but no cease-fire was
offered to let them get out safely. Thousands will die along with
relatively few terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   One Baltic leader said this was like answering the terrorist
hijacking of an aircraft by shooting down the plane. Clinton
sternly warned that such slaughter of civilians would mean ``Russia
will pay a heavy price for those actions.''
</P>
<P>
   What price? Only that its threatened atrocity ``will further
alienate the global community from Russia.'' What a weak-kneed
response. The time to list the consequences is before the massacre.
Such as:
</P>
<P>
   1. Disinvite the Russians from next week's scheduled meeting of
the Group of 8 foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dispatch a trade-and-aid delegation to Georgia immediately.
</P>
<P>
   3. Describe the suspension of the next IMF. loan to Russia for
what it is _ retaliation for atrocity, and not for economic
inaction that saves Russia's face.
</P>
<P>
   4. Withdraw our scheduled Export-Import Bank guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   5. Point out how Arab oil producers, now paying lip service to
their Muslim brethren in Chechnya, are financing Russia's attack
with their OPEC-induced shortages and inflated oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   6. Begin drawing down oil from our brimming strategic reserve,
replenishing the reserve when world prices drop.
</P>
<P>
   7. Move quickly to bring the Baltic states into NATO. Russian
imperialism is still alive and growling.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has a way of responding to credible threats. What
happened when John McCain and George W. Bush made plain they would
withdraw from the ABM treaty if the Russians refused necessary
modifications to allow limited missile defense? Russia's Duma,
after four years, decided to take up ratification of Start II.
</P>
<P>
   Cluck-clucking and hand-wringing have no effect. Mass killing is
no game, great or otherwise. Diplomatic and economic pressure can
save lives.
</P>

GARDENING GIFTS: WHAT BECOMES A GREEN THUMB MOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, I try mightily to suggest truly original gifts for
the garden, and every year I end up recommending the classic stuff,
because the cute, trendy things, like red rubber clogs or that
little plastic bird feeder with the suction cup that sticks to the
window do not hold up when real life crashes through the holidays
like an overweight bluejay.
</P>
<P>
   I actually loved the clogs I got one year, even though they were
too small, so I'd clomp around in them doing light chores until I
got a cramp in my toe. Besides, they are no good for digging or
venturing into some snake pit like the cellar or barn for that
perfect something or other to hold up the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners appreciate useful things that last. I swear by my
Felco No. 7 pruners with the rotating handle, which protects me
from repetitive stress. They cost about $30. And I am loyal to
Womanswork gloves, both the soft deerskin ones ($28), which fit
like a second skin, and the tougher pigskin ones ($23) for heavy
digging, from (800) 639-2709 or at www.womansworkgloves.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are cheaper products, but in my experience cheaper pruners
break, and cheaper gloves don't fit. And avoid pretty hats. They
are usually too hot, too floppy, too stiff, too small. Hats have to
be tried on and jammed this way and that by the gardener in the
store.
</P>
<P>
   I have a friend who recently fell in love with gardening, and I
enjoy introducing her to seeds like that fabulous pumpkin that
tastes as good as it looks, Rouge Vif d'Etampes, or the old
climbing rose Mme. Gregoire Staechelin, with pink blossoms as sexy
as satin petticoats, from Heirloom Old Garden Roses, (503)
538-1576.
</P>
<P>
   I love getting seeds saved from a friend's garden, like the
poppy seeds I was given on Long Island one year, along with careful
instructions: sprinkle them over the snow in February (or bare,
frozen ground) and don't do a thing after that, even when they
germinate and grow in clumps that look in need of thinning.
</P>
<P>
   I grew glorious poppies for a few years, harvesting the seeds
from their dried pods every fall and giving them away at Christmas.
Then, somehow, I let my own poppies die out and tried to grow them
from store-bought seed the next few years. They were dull wimps
compared with the ones that were passed down to me. So last summer,
on my birthday, when an old friend in Vermont handed me a pill
bottle full of tiny black seeds, from her father, who had planted
some from me years ago, I felt the magic of a true gift.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a friend who is a serious gardener, and you want to
spend a little money, a Juwel Cold Frame is a winner, if the person
has space and the inclination to harvest salad greens in winter.
It's a sturdy German design with an automatic ventilator, about
$200 at Harris Seeds, (800) 514-4441. And the automatic vent is
nice on a sunny February day when you can't run out and let the
steam out of your mini-greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice gift for salad lovers is a sprouter gizmo for the
kitchen. Adzuki beans, alfalfa, red clover, lentils, green peas and
mung beans make delicious, nutritious sprouts, and though you can
grow them in a jar with holes punched in the lid, ready-made trays
with aeration holes and covers make it easier. Territorial Seed Co.
sells a nice one, including alfalfa seeds and instructions, for
$13, (541) 942-9547.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun wooing children into the garden with a sturdy set of
child-size tools, like the rake, shovel and hoe by Brio, $11 each
at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's shop, (718) 623-7280 or
www.bbg.org, and some seeds just for them, like Mammoth sunflowers
or moonflowers, which open at night with an enchanting fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a plant to someone has the same risks as giving a puppy.
You have to be sure the giftee has the temperament and conditions
not to kill the gift. Two plants that are good at surviving past
the holidays are Jasminum sambac Maid of Orleans, a sweetly scented
jasmine, which can do well on a windowsill, and the dwarf lemon
Citrus limon Meyer, which has fragrant blossoms and bears delicious
fruit, with proper care. About four hours of sun a day in winter
will suffice, given cool enough temperatures, from about 55 degrees
at night to 65 in the day. Then come spring, move it outside. Both
of these plants are widely available, but I often order such things
from Logee's Greenhouses in Danielson, Conn., (888) 330-8038 (toll
free), or from www.logees.com. Both plants, in four-inch pots, are
about $15.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overlook a simple gift, just because it's been given a
million times. Planting a few narcissus bulbs in a dish of pebbles
and water is as much a ritual as stuffing and gravy with the
turkey. But don't get Gallaway or Zeva, which smell as if something
died behind the walls. There are others with a far sweeter, less
musky scent, like the yellow varieties Bethlehem, Israel and
Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Or try some heavenly sweet Chinese sacred lilies,
www.brentandbeckysbulbs.com or (804) 693-3966. The price for these
bulbs is usually $10 for 10, but if you order before Dec. 15,
there's a 50 percent discount on all bulbs left in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Grand ideas, like trips to Italy or drip irrigation systems or
finding that one-in-a-million high school kid who can weed without
ripping up all the clematis, require more planning and money. But I
wouldn't turn up my nose at any of them.

USING EVERY TRICK IN FIGHTING SWEATSHOPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You know you are in the presence of a certain kind of
labor advocate when he begins to talk about the effective use of
nuns as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies really, really hate it when the nuns get
involved and start writing letters,'' said Charles Kernaghan,
smiling maliciously from behind round glasses that reflected the
light of a solitary desk lamp he had turned on in his darkened
office one night last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what are they going to say against nuns, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Kernaghan is the executive director of the National Labor
Committee, which, despite its name, is not national at all, but a
crowded, cluttered bunch of offices in the Garment District from
which Kernaghan and five other people direct a militant,
low-budget, much-criticized campaign against the use of sweatshop
labor by large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kernaghan led a reporter through the offices, trying not to step
on the high school students spread on the floor painting picket
signs for an anti-sweatshop protest march planned for Thursday
along Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He cleared tangled piles of brand new sweat pants and blouses
and baby clothes from his couch. (He lugs these clothes around the
country to use as props during speeches, comparing the retail price
to the wages paid to the foreign workers who assemble the clothes.)
</P>
<P>
   He had just returned from Seattle, where he went as a guest of
the United Steelworkers of America. But while he was there, he
broke off from the labor march and locked arms with students who
were blocking hotels to protest the meeting of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   For a gloomy sort of man _ the kind who loves Kafka and Sartre
and describes the empty feeling he gets even after he wins public
relations wars with big companies _ Seattle was a vision of a world
the way Charles Kernaghan would like it.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the violence, which he condemned and would have liked
to stop _ ``But I was not going to get killed defending a
Starbucks,'' he says _ the protests were the kind that Kernaghan
thought died out not long after he helped shut down Loyola
University of Chicago as an undergraduate in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues that no one in the United States really knew about _
except a tiny little minority of people _ now it's out there all
across the country because of Seattle,'' he says. ``It's like the
Kathie Lee thing: now people are thinking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Kathie Lee thing'' _ his unlikely connection with Kathie
Lee Gifford, the talk show host _ is, in a way, the beginning of
any story about Kernaghan, a 51-year old former psychology teacher
and self-described perpetual graduate student who worked as, among
many other things, a taxi driver, a carpenter, a truck unloader and
a photographer before almost wandering into labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, when he told a congressional committee that
15-year-old girls were earning 31 cents an hour and working 75-hour
weeks in a Honduran factory that made Mrs. Gifford's sportswear, he
set off a makeshift publicity campaign that brought more attention
to sweatshops than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Kernaghan, who spent most of an interview this week talking
nonstop while staring at a pen he was twisting with both hands, is
the first to admit that he can be overzealous and even unfair and
that his facts can sometimes be a little off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a trained economist. I don't come from an organizing
background. I don't speak Spanish. I don't use a computer. I don't
really like talking on the phone. I can't raise money. And I can't
network.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``But I often think that the reason why the work is
successful in some ways is because it was a mistake that I came
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tells the brief version of his life story, though, it
becomes clear that it was not much of a mistake. He grew up in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and then Valley Stream, N.Y., the son of a
construction supervisor who emigrated from Scotland. His parents
were strong Catholics who took in foster children and presented
religion to him as a way of thinking about how to treat other
people. ``It made me a radical,'' he says, ``really from the time I
was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   He became interested early on in psychology, mostly to figure
out ``how the society operates and why certain people get
shafted.'' But after studying it for years and then helping to
teach it as a graduate assistant at Duquesne University in
Pittsburgh, one day he looked out the window of a classroom and
thought to himself, ``I just can't do this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he quit and got in his car and drove until he stopped
driving. He got out at a pretty town of about 50 people in
Pennsylvania called Ohiopyle, where he rented a house and dragged a
picnic table into the woods and began to read (mostly Sartre and
Kafka).
</P>
<P>
   Later, he worked just enough to earn money to wander the world,
and by the time he got to El Salvador in the mid-1980s, where he
saw working conditions firsthand, he knew what he was going to do.
(He now lives in an apartment in the East Village with Barbara
Briggs, who also helps run the campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   Where does Kernaghan go from here? He wants to get better at
raising money, so he can hire more people and go after more
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big foundations won't touch us with a 10-foot pole,'' he
says. ``And I'll tell you, if we were doing whales or penguins, we
would be funded up the gazoo.''

RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT IN WASHINGTON HELD IN SPY CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS listening device found at State Department in 2nd graf; ADDS
that diplomat is likely to be expelled from the United States if he
claims diplomatic immunity in 4th graf) 
 (Eds.: This story is an added starter on The New York Times front
page) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal authorities Wednesday night arrested a
Russian diplomat believed to be an intelligence officer who had
sought classified information from the State Department, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not identify the diplomat, but they said
that the case involved a listening device found in a conference
room at the State Department and was linked to a substantial
Russian espionage effort aimed at pilfering sensitive information
about American activities abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the arrest followed a
counterintelligence investigation and that it would be announced on
Thursday. The Russian diplomat, who was employed at Moscow's
embassy in Washington, was arrested in the Washington area, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The official, detained while carrying an electronic listening
device used to detect surveillance, has immunity as a diplomat and
is expected to assert this to avoid prosecution in the United
States, the American officials said. If the official chooses that
route, he is likely to be expelled from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the arrest seemed to link it to an incident in
Moscow on Nov. 30, when the Russian authorities detained an
American diplomat who they said was a spy preparing to meet a
Russian contact.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials said that the arrest Wednesday night was
not intended as retaliation for that detention, but rather
represented the culmination of an investigation by the FBI and
other agencies that had begun before the Moscow incident.
</P>
<P>
   Former American intelligence officials familiar with
counterespionage cases said that the FBI and CIA have tended not to
engage in such retaliatory measures, at least in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that any Americans were detained
Wednesday night, suggesting that FBI counterintelligence agents may
have lured the Russian to a clandestine meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of a Russian official was highly unusual. While the
practice was common at the height of the the Cold War, in recent
years the diplomatic expulsions have declined. The State Department
made no comment Wednesday night on the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The last Russian diplomat expelled from the United States was
ordered out of the country in 1994 a week after the arrest of
Aldrich H. Ames, the CIA officer who was later convicted of spying
for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the arrest appeared certain to further strain the
already uneasy relationship between the two countries, already at
odds over Russia's offensive against its rebellious province of
Chechnya and the U.S. plan to erect a limited anti-missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the significance
of espionage between the United States and Russia has declined
along with Moscow's reduced global importance. Yet each country
still actively collects intelligence about its former adversary and
pursues investigations of alleged penetrations.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA continues to operate an intelligence station at the
American Embassy in Moscow, and the Russians have long conducted a
similar operation from their embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and CIA officials have frequently complained, in fact, that
the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service that is the
successor to the Soviet KGB, has maintained a large presence in
Washington throughout the 1990s. Earlier this year, Clinton
administration officials complained to Moscow that there were too
many spies in the Russian Embassy here and demanded that the levels
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has also exploited the disintegration of the Soviet
Union to expand beyond Moscow and open stations in many of the
newly independent states that were once Soviet republics. In some
of those countries, the agency has established strong relationships
with the local intelligence services as well.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the American authorities have investigated a
number of cases of Russian espionage, but most have stemmed from
instances in which Americans, often motivated by money, had
volunteered to spy for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious case to emerge in the post-Cold War era was
that of Ames, the CIA officer who was arrested in February 1994. He
was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for spying for
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Ames, a career counterintelligence officer, turned over to his
Russian handlers the identities of a number of Russian and East
European agents who were secretly supplying information to the
United States. Ames was paid nearly $2 million for his information.
More than a dozen of the agents identified by Ames were executed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the arrest in Moscow last week, the Russians
identified the American espionage suspect as Cheri Leberknight and
said she was a CIA officer who had been working undercover as a
secretary at the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   When she was detained in Moscow, the Russian authorities accused
her of trying to obtain secret Russian military documents. They
said she carried a map and a number of devices designed to detect
whether she was under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   After being detained, she was released to American Embassy
officials because she had diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest Wednesday night is the latest in a series of recent
spy incidents, confirming that espionage did not die with the end
of the Cold War. Earlier this year, Germany's internal security
service reportedly forced the CIA to withdraw three of its officers
from Germany, in a sign that German authorities want the agency to
scale back its operations on their soil.

DISABLED BRING CHRISTMAS JOY TO NEEDY CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You could feel old St. Nick himself in the room
Wednesday morning. Oh, you couldn't see him, but he was there all
right _ probably beaming like a proud father.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his favorite children _ the physically disabled and the
poor _ were having a Christmas party in an office building over on
Gloria Avenue in Van Nuys, and you just knew St. Nick wouldn't miss
this one for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not when it gets tougher and tougher every year to find the real
spirit of Christmas down here. The spirit that comes from the
heart, not the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of spirit that permeated every room and hallway in
United Cerebral Palsy's headquarters in the Van Nuys section of Los
Angeles Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   St. Nick was there all right. He wouldn't miss the final chapter
to this wonderful Christmas story that's been unfolding on Gloria
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A story of how more than 40 wheelchair-using adults with
cerebral palsy decided to forego their own Christmas presents to
play Santa Claus to some needy children in the East Valley this
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   A story of how they remembered back to their own childhoods, and
what it was like to go without and always need help.
</P>
<P>
   Remembered how it felt as a kid, especially at Christmas time.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   It took less than an hour, that's all. Less than one hour for
the apprehension and fear to melt away, and the warmth and
friendship emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour for these little kids from poor families in
the East Valley to see past the erratic, spastic movements and
sporadic yelling from the adults sitting in wheelchairs to the
loving person inside.
</P>
<P>
   The person who had made them all hand-crafted piggy banks, dolls
and stuffed toys, collected food for them, and now wanted to be
their Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made these toys because we know how children feel if they
don't have any presents on Christmas morning,'' Valerie Wright said
in a halting voice to the children from her wheelchair, fighting
every word so she could be understood.
</P>
<P>
   The children smiled back. They understood.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the holiday crafts that Wright and the others
make were sold to raise funds for themselves and their programs,
but not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, they came to me and said they wanted to give their
toys to needy children because they would appreciate them more,''
said Wendy Odom, head of the center's enrichment staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love these kids because they share a common bond,'' she
said. ``They both know what it's like to go without and need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The children who came to the center Wednesday were from poor
families that get help at the United Methodist Church of Sepulveda,
one of the most community-active churches in the Valley in
providing services, clothes and meals to poor families and the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you guys have hearts of gold, these children will have
toys to play with and food to eat,'' the Rev. Jim Hamilton told
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's when David Nichols clapped from his wheelchair, and
Kristi Arujo cried from hers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the staff at United Cerebral Palsy began fighting
back their own tears because they were seeing something they hadn't
seen before. David never claps like this, and Kristi never cries,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see these people every day, and today we're seeing inside
them,'' said Diane Cavazos, assistant manager at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing those hearts of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, old St. Nick was there all right Wednesday, probably
beaming like a proud father.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his favorite children were having a Christmas party, and
you just knew he wouldn't miss this one for the world.
</P>
<P>
   He had found the real spirit of Christmas alive and well in an
office building on Gloria Avenue.

OFFICIALS WANT ARMY TO EVALUATE BELMONT LEARNING CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Unified's top two administrators said
Wednesday they want the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate
the environmentally troubled Belmont Learning Center and guide the
district to a final decision on whether the nation's costliest high
school should be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller said he and incoming
Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines will recommend at next week's
school board meeting that the Army conduct a six-week fact-finding
mission on scandal-tainted Belmont, the nation's costliest school
project.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Daily News' disclosure that U.S. Army
Secretary Louis Caldera had been a big backer of Belmont, Miller
said he was not worried about a potential conflict of interest
because the federal officer had no influence in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Along with supporting Belmont while he was a state legislator
serving the downtown area, Caldera also was once employed by
O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, the law firm the district is suing for its
handling of key matters related to the project. The federal
appointee could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the Monday announcement the agency will manage the
district's billion-dollar school building program, Miller had
denied he and Cortines wanted to use the Army at Belmont. On
Wednesday he said the decision wasn't made until that day, and he
argued the Army's expertise is needed to give the board all the
facts before it votes on the fate of Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to engage the Army Corps of Engineers to gather
information we need to manage the decision process, so we finally
all have the same information to make a decision,'' Miller said,
announcing the planned action at a special public meeting in
Belmont's attendance area.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the school board, the Army will be asked to
determine how much it would cost to complete the school and whether
state funding would be available. The corps also would have the
task of determining how long it would take to finish the school,
and it would investigate alternative sites for high schools in the
attendance area.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the added time would allow the state Department of
Toxic Substances Control to give the district more detailed
information on environmental hazards at the school, which is
located atop an oil field seeping potentially deadly and explosive
gases.
</P>
<P>
   Miller added an advisory committee of students, teachers,
parents and administrators will be formed to guide the board's
final decision, which most likely would come in February.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before more than 200 students in the library of Belmont
High School, Cortines said his previous endorsements to finish
Belmont were largely based upon emotion and that more
fact-gathering is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Genethia Hayes endorsed the administrators' plan
and changed her previous position on Belmont, saying the amount of
money it will take to build the school safely is no longer an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not made up my mind,'' Hayes said, after listening to
students plead for the completion of the school. ``My only issue is
safety. It is not about money for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that is a danger, to rush. We need to have all the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Victoria Castro, an ardent Belmont supporter, said
she will be courteous and allow the Army to conduct its review but
Belmont must be completed regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind this school has to be built,''
Castro said, wiping tears away from her eyes. ``We must build
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has sunk $170million into Belmont, but it called
off all new construction and padlocked the property last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Miller and Cortines broached the subject of state aid
during a private meeting with Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa
but came away without a definite answer.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens commission that reviewed the public works project
determined it would take $112million to complete the campus and
concluded the school could not open for five to eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Belmont lined up Wednesday night to denounce Miller
and Cortines' plan to involve the Army at Belmont, focusing on the
secretary's past involvement in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The critics charged that the engineering corps is in no position
to do an impartial study of Belmont since the Secretary of the Army
is a Belmont supporter who once worked for a law firm involved in
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army Corps cannot be considered an independent analyst
because of the conflict of interest that exists at the top,'' said
state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles. ``No study should begin under
the shadow of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden worried that the move was really an effort to pry loose
new state funding for Belmont by convincing state lawmakers the
project was in capable hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be an orchestrated campaign under way to
save Belmont, and it's about profits and reputations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential conflict of interest involving Caldera also
troubled Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, who chairs a state
commission that funds school construction.
</P>
<P>
   While the Army may be able to help the district build schools,
Wildman said the Army should not work on Belmont. He argued that
the district should kill Belmont now rather than search for new
ways to save it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get rid of the district's obsession with this
compromised project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the topics Miller now wants the Army to address were
already covered by the commission that voted 4-3 to finish the
school but its decision was clouded by the opposition of its
nonvoting head, former District Attorney Ira Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   But commission member and former state Sen. Charles Calderon
said there was still room for another study to determine costs and
a timetable. &QL; 
``They're moving targets, difficult to pin down, because you have
to make a lot of assumptions about, for instance, the value of the
land if you could sell it,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the board feels it needs more information, I'm for whatever
it takes to get them that information.''

HIV-INFECTED BOY, 12, IS HELD IN SEX ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn boy who is infected with HIV sexually
assaulted at least two children in his neighborhood, the police
charged on Wednesday night. His youngest victim was a 3-year-old
boy, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, 12, was arrested by detectives on Wednesday and
arraigned in Brooklyn Family Court on three counts of sodomy,
including the assault on the toddler and others on a 9-year-old
boy. He was also charged with one count of attempted assault, one
count of reckless endangerment and one count of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The police said on Wednesday night that they were interviewing
other children who are believed to have been attacked by the boy,
said Sgt. Ellen Tietjen, a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The police withheld the name of the boy. Because of his age, he
will be charged and prosecuted as a child, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Tietjen said early on Thursday morning that she did not
know when or where the alleged assaults took place or whether the
boy had been held after arraignment or released.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ The fire wasn't there. The usual passion was
missing. The determination was absent.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those elements were not, however, hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   They were sitting behind the Rockets' bench, immobilized in the
prone left leg of Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   On a night dedicated to celebrate his last visit to
Philadelphia, Barkley ruptured a quadriceps tendon, ending his
spectacular 16-year NBA career where it began. Without him, the
Rockets put up little fight, losing 83-73 to the 76ers in a sloppy,
lifeless performance in which neither team seemed able to focus on
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a horrible night for us, losing Charles, and just a
horrible game,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We hung in
there defensively, then just got selfish. We started taking the
first option. We surrendered. Just surrendered. It was like we had
a built-in excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would have been a nice tribute to win the game for the
guy. We were right there and turned it into a rec game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets committed 27 turnovers, more than any Sixers
opponent has in the four seasons of the First Union Center. The
Rockets did not shoot much better, making just 26 of 71 shots.
Between them, the teams combined for 49 turnovers, still finding
time to miss a combined 94 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the ugliest games ever,'' Sixers coach Larry
Brown said. ``I think there was concern he (Barkley) wasn't coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets said they immediately knew Barkley's season and
career were over. In position to see the knee as he was helped past
them, they had no doubts about the severity of the injury or chance
of a return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when he walked off the floor,'' Rockets center Kelvin
Cato said. ``I just hope he can come back and walk right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, already playing without center Hakeem Olajuwon as
he rehabilitates after hernia surgery, certainly played as if they
were thinking about the leader unable to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley returned to a seat behind the coaches late in the first
half and came back to that spot for the second half. He joined
huddles and instructed the Rockets' young guards. But he was not
the same, nor were they.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt,'' Rockets guard Steve Francis said. ``We can't use it
as an excuse. But when Charles went down, everyone knew he was
finished. I just saw everybody put their head down. Nobody was
thinking about the game. We were thinking about the rest of the
season, thinking about Charles. I couldn't stop thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets finished the first half in a daze. They stayed close
in the third quarter, largely on the strength of their defense. But
without Barkley in the low post to settle them, they collapsed in
the fourth quarter without executing as they had been in recent
weeks with or without Barkley on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let the game fall apart,'' Tomjanovich said. ``In the
fourth quarter, we get him the ball and know we'll get a good shot.
Now we've got to start thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, the thoughts were displaced. The Rockets
could not get the image of Barkley's misshapen knee out of their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him coming off the floor,'' forward Carlos Rogers said.
``To see his leg just hanging there, I never saw anything like
that. Coming in at halftime and then having to go out and play he
says a lot of crazy things and does a lot of crazy things, but he's
a good guy. Everything he says is for your benefit. Whoa, boy, it's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets remained within three points three minutes into the
fourth quarter. But in a span of just 2{ minutes, the Sixers put
together an 11-3 run as the Rockets missed three long jumpers and
three free throws interrupted only by a Kenny Thomas 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets never challenged again. They did not get as close as
even nine points until Bryce Drew hit a jumper with 1:30 left. By
then, however, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Francis had 18 points and seven assists but said he ``shot
horribly.'' He made six of 15 shots. Cuttino Mobley added 14 points
in his return to Philadelphia but made just three of 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers were led by guards Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, who each
had 16 points and combined for 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was super-hard to focus,'' Rockets forward Matt Bullard
said. ``Especially when it's Charles, it was harder if not
impossible to focus on what we were trying to do. It was almost
surreal. His last time playing here. It was surreal watching it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley described the end of his career coming in the city where
it began as ironic. But there was another irony the Rockets must
now live with and that defeated them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped the team a lot, especially with this being a young
team,'' Rogers said. ``You need a guy like that to help a young
team through tough times, times like this.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT ended, perhaps fittingly, in the place where the roly-poly kid
out of Leeds, Ala., first made his transformation from the Round
Mound of Rebound into one of the greatest players in the history of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The circle was closed in Philadelphia, the birthplace of
American independence, and nobody has ever been more fiercely
independent than Charles Wade Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary and conscientious, loud and lovable, outrageous and
outreaching, hard-headed and hard-working, profane and profound.
</P>
<P>
   He is the line from an old Kris Kristofferson song: a walking
contradiction, partly fact and partly fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the history of the NBA ever experienced as much
frustration or had as much fun. No championships. No regrets.
</P>
<P>
   It ended in a tangle of bodies under the Rockets' basket and
left him lying, appropriately enough, in the paint, the area where
a man of his 6-4{ stature somehow managed to survive and thrive
among the giants for so long and eventually stood taller than most.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the player who was chided throughout most of his
career for being such a weak defender was running back down the
floor at age 36 to try to make a defensive play against Tyrone Hill
of the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley jumped sideways and landed in an awkward manner, and in
the very flash of that first moment, sprawled out on the hardwood
floor, he had the look of recognition on his face.
</P>
<P>
   It was over.
</P>
<P>
   All of the scores and all of the wars, all of the miles and all
of the smiles, all of the controversial comments and the
incontrovertible evidence by those able to get close to him that
prove he is one of the rare celebrities who in truth is a much
better person than he would dare let you believe.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '80s and the '90s, in political terms, Michael
Jordan was Slick Willie, good-looking and well-coiffed, skating
around the tough issues, dancing away from controversy while always
finding a way to win jewelry and the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, at the same time, was the slam-dunking equivalent of
Ross Perot, perhaps crazy as a loon and always locked out of the
ultimate prize, but with so many of his own singular opinions and
never encumbered by a P.R. man's need to cover up his warts.
</P>
<P>
   Through the time of its greatest growth, the NBA _ and even Air
Jordan himself _ needed Barkley as a kind of counterweight to the
high-gloss packaging of corporate vanilla sameness. He stirred the
pot and kept them in touch with the street. He was the pea under
their mattress, never letting commissioner David Stern and the
suits get too comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The court was his stage, and on it he was Olivier, the
consummate actor who could play any role _ warrior, joker, charmer,
villain, understanding teammate and a heckler's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he broke the nose of a drunk who confronted him outside a
Milwaukee bar and, yes, he tossed a boorish little ice-throwing
fellow into the window of an Orlando nightclub. He likely spent
more time signing autographs than any high-profile athlete of his
generation, and he talks to the kids he meets, not at them or over
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``No tears or crying or sad music for me when it's over,'' he
said just last week in a casual locker-room conversation in Los
Angeles. ``The NBA has allowed me to become Charles Barkley.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about questioning his credentials, and never
mind with the numbers, which are huge.
</P>
<P>
   At the NBA's 50th anniversary celebration in 1997, when a
non-believer asked the great Elgin Baylor whether Barkley belonged
among the top 50 players in history, he was greeted by a stare.
``Maybe in the top five,'' Baylor replied. Later that same weekend,
Wilt Chamberlain pointed across a room at Barkley and said, ``I
would like to have gone to war against Russell with that boy on my
side.''
</P>
<P>
   As the horn sounded on the Rockets' 83-73 loss Wednesday night,
Carlos Rogers walked over to Barkley, who was sitting on the bench
with crutches, and kissed his bald head.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with him playing the role of teacher, mentor on a young
team that is struggling to find itself.
</P>
<P>
   After all the years of being able to physically overpower the
game, dragging the undertalented Sixers to the Eastern Conference
finals to earn the admiration of the tough Philly fans, then moving
on to Phoenix and lifting the soulless Suns to the NBA Finals, he
was playing his final days more on his wits than his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wade Barkley had been propping these young Rockets up in
the absence of Hakeem Olajuwon, and in the coming days we likely
will see just how much.
</P>
<P>
   Damn, I'll miss him.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Corey Moore didn't go to Virginia Tech as a prize recruit. Several
colleges told the Brownsville, Tenn., native he was too small to
play on the defensive line at 6-0 and 200 pounds. Among those was
the University of Tennessee.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years later, Moore has added 25 pounds and helped Virginia
Tech to a national championship showdown with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Moore was named the winner of the 30th annual
Rotary Lombardi Award, honoring college football's top lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a guy that's been big on individual awards. I
don't think I'll ever be,'' said Moore, who won over the Penn State
duo of linebacker LaVar Arrington and defensive end Courtney Brown
and Florida State nose guard Corey Simon. ``I'm very team-oriented
and worry about team goals, but this is nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be in the same company of top-notch players.
I wish I could give each and every one of those guys a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank the Virginia Tech football program for even
giving me the opportunity to play and develop me into not only the
football player I am today as well as the person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lombardi Award continued a week of honors for Moore. On
Monday, he received the 1999 Bronko Nagurski Trophy, which goes to
college football's top defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was a big part of the 11-0 season that landed the Hokies a
berth in the Jan. 4 Sugar Bowl. For the second consecutive season
he led the Big East in sacks, and his 17 sacks this season
accounted for 146 yards in losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of Corey Moore,'' said Charley Wiles,
Virginia Tech's defensive ends coach, who accompanied Moore at the
J.W. Marriott Hotel for the presentation of the award _ 40 pounds
of granite atop a silver base.
</P>
<P>
   `` He makes everyone around him better and (sometimes) you get
those people that have a special gift that they can affect other
people in a positive manner, make them want to be better. Not only
players (but) coaches, teachers. I mean everybody he comes in
contact with, he affects them in that manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work is what got Moore to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't come in the door 6-foot, 230 pounds,'' said Wiles.
``He was 200 pounds, and he gained 25 pounds over the four years at
Virginia Tech. Increased his speed from 4.78 to 4.38 (in the
40-yard dash). Those are the things that happen through hard work.
This speaks for what kind of kid he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had 59 tackles and three pass deflections and caused three
fumbles for a defense that ranked third nationally in scoring
defense and rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer that size doesn't matter,'' said Moore.
``You can't measure a person's heart. I can't wait to not only show
my heart on the football field but also in society as I grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is an outstanding student with an undergraduate degree in
finance. He is working on a second degree in management. ``He
realizes football is not the only thing in life,'' said Wiles.
``He's like, `I've got to prepare myself through education to be a
successful guy' and that's the way he works.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Rotary Club of Houston, the Lombardi Award is
in memory of legendary coach Vince Lombardi, who died of cancer.
The Rotary Club of Houston has raised more than $2.35 million for
the American Cancer Society.

BRYANT STARTS, LAKERS STOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Kobe Bryant finally started. The Los
Angeles Lakers' winning streak ended. Go try to make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, those events happened concurrently Wednesday
night, but the return of the star guard and the loss that followed
was more coincidence than correlation. This fast-breaking whirlwind
known as the Sacramento Kings earned most of the credit for L.A.'s
103-91 loss, the Lakers' first defeat in 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Kings ran, as they do with more flair than anyone
in the league. But the fast break didn't kill the Lakers. The
Kings' faster bursts from Point A to Point B, everywhere on the
floor, did.
</P>
<P>
   It showed up in the rebounding column, where Sacramento had a
45-37 edge, and in the steals column, where the Kings won 11-4. The
other second-effort scraps for loose balls were harder to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a couple of things about the intensity level we
carried out there,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``I found it
interesting that they beat us on whatever they call that `hustle
board' out there quite badly during the course of the game. That
really said something about our reaction to go to the ball. We
didn't react well to the ball early, they got offensive rebounds,
putbacks, a 3-point shot out of three successive offensive rebounds
by Nick Anderson.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of effort carried the Kings to a seven-point lead by
halftime, and the Lakers vainly played catch-up all night. Even 27
points each from Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings more than countered with 20 points from Chris Webber
and 19 from Jason Williams, and kept the momentum going with big
bursts off the bench from Peja Stojakovic (19 points) and Lawrence
Funderburke (10 points).
</P>
<P>
   For Bryant, making his first start of the season after four
relief appearances, it was a shaky return. He overcame early
shooting struggles to finish 11 of 19, and had six rebounds and
five assists, but his six glaring turnovers stifled Laker rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant wasn't alone _ O'Neal and Ron Harper added five turnovers
apiece _ but he knew how costly his mistakes were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain in the butt,'' Bryant said, quietly assessing his night.
``I hate it. I hate it, man. I hate it. I hate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to try so bad to make up for it, try to cancel that,
get that out of your game as much as you can. You just have to
study it and see why that happens in certain situations, read
what's going on, because everything is going to happen for a reason
out there. You just pick it apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant once lost the ball spinning into traffic in the lane,
once stumbling into a baseline move and once just getting picked by
Anderson _ ``critical errors,'' Jackson noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming back and trying to find himself,'' said Rick Fox.
``I'm sure right now he is pressing a little bit to find a rhythm
with us. . . . (We) just try to remain patient and hope he
recognizes that he doesn't have to save the world. We were doing
pretty good. Come along and be part of this. He's an addition, he's
not a subtraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant nearly atoned for it all, scoring eight straight points
in the fourth to cut the Kings lead to 89-80 wth 4:16 to go. But
the best the Lakers could do was get the lead down to seven points.
They didn't make a jumpshot the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Harper was 0 for 7 for the night. Derek Fisher, who went to the
bench to make room for Bryant, was 4 for 14 in his first relief
performance since last season. Glen Rice struggled for the second
straight game, going 3 for 12.
</P>
<P>
   Defense, the Lakers' new calling card, also failed them. O'Neal
got in early foul trouble, leading to an obvious hesitancy that
netted him just nine rebounds and no blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (the foul trouble) changed the way he played
defense,'' Jackson said. ``He's been a big enforcer for us inside
and I thought he just had to step back and allowed things to happen
to our interior defense.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they play the game b.s. like that, you just have to step
back a little bit,'' he said. ``I gotta stay in the game. When they
call b.s. like that, what else can I do?''

NEW-LOOK USC ROLLS PAST HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Henry Bibby has grown weary of being
asked when he was going to use more new players, so he took a
pre-emptive strike against the question Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby gave freshman center Kostas Charissis his first career
start and substituted more freely than usual, and it paid off in an
85-56 victory over Hawaii before 2,092 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The person most surprised about the lineup change was the
6-foot-11 Charissis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect anything. I was excited,'' Charissis said. ``I
was nervous in the beginning, but after about five minutes I was in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Charissis contributed four points and a career-high six
rebounds, but more importantly made the Trojans taller and allowed
other players to get some rest.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference was that center Brian Scalabrine moved to
small forward. He had 19 points and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to bang, but I'll do anything for the the team,''
Scalabrine said. ``It's not that big a difference. But defending a
small forward is a lot harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said previous starter David Bluthenthal was not being
demoted by the move, although Bluthenthal played 26 minutes, which
was slightly under his season average of 29.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a different look,'' Bibby said. ``It's a nonconference
game, you see where guys fit. I told David he would play more
minutes off the bench than if he was starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Rashad Jones (22 minutes) and shooting guard Nate
Hair (10 minutes) were the other reserves given a chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nonconference is to see where guys are to bring them
along,'' Bibby said. ``We want to have them ready for the Pac-10
and win in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (4-4) certainly made a case for playing more than
the usual six-man rotation. They had one of the best defensive
efforts of the season, holding Hawaii (5-2) to 38-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did tonight was pick up the defensive intensity,''
Bibby said. ``We just haven't stopped people.''
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent early, as USC jumped out to an 18-8 lead and
boosted the advantage to 16 (37-21) on a layup by Jeff Trepagnier,
who had a game-high 20 points after missing last weekend's loss to
St. Bonaventure to attend his grandmother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The second half became mostly garbage time, with the highlights
five USC dunks, including one by Charissis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better this game than all the games before,''
Charissis said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: USC forward Sam Clancy had his third double-double (16
points, 11 rebounds), the first Trojan with three straight since
forward Jaha Wilson in 1996. Clancy's father, Sam Sr., had 18
rebounds against Hawaii while playing for Pittsburgh in 1979.

MURRAY, KINGS THRASH ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some nights, it's good to face an expansion team,
score a few goals, hit a few people, don't think too much about
what's ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With a four-game trip looming, the Los Angeles Kings took
advantage of the Atlanta Thrashers on Wednesday with a 4-0 victory
in front of 15,210 at Staples Center. They didn't play great, but
they didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille, who missed a month with a broken left foot,
capped the feel-good evening with his first goal in almost six
weeks. Robitaille had 10 goals in his first 15 games before the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   After a 2-3-2 stretch in their last seven games, no Ziggy Palffy
and a game Friday night against mighty Detroit, the Kings took a
3-0 lead after two periods. San Jose, which still leads them by two
points in Pacific Division, defeated Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem a little early for scoreboard watching, but every
team in the Kings' division would qualify for the playoffs if the
season ended today.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray said he expects teams in the Western
Conference to spread out in the next couple of weeks. He just
doesn't want to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Glen Murray, the Kings hottest offensive player,
had a goal and an assist and Garry Galley scored a rare power play
goal as the club raised its record to 15-7-6. The power play goal
was just their third in the last 42 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that Kings goalie Jamie Storr faced just 21 shots
to record the sixth shutout of his six-year NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were lucky to take an early lead. The Thrashers
appeared to score the first goal when Shean Donovan beat Storr with
a 25-foot blast just 3:56 into his first game after being acquired
by Atlanta earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal was disallowed when Donovan's new teammate Andreas
Karlsson was whistled for holding.
</P>
<P>
   That helped because the Kings didn't play without much jump.
Palffy, the team's leading scorer with 26 points, missed the game
with a sore lower back. Palffy came out of Saturday's 3-3 tie with
Tampa Bay in the third period with the flu and could not practice
the past three days because of back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are hoping to have him back during the trip but are
happy to have Glen Murray pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Blake, expected to get additional playing time in Palffy's
absence, scored the game's first goal midway through the first
period. Blake, who had two goals on the Kings' last trip, was told
by Andy Murray he needed more grit and less finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Blake did just that, poking in his own rebound past Thrashers'
Norm Maracle after taking a cross-ice pass in front from Brad
Chartrand.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes into the second period, it was Glen
Murray's turn. He parked in front of Maracle and scored after
taking a pass from Donald Audette. It was Murray's 12th goal and
seventh in the last six games. During that stretch, he has had
three two-goal games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Storr was seldom tested. He faced just 13 shots in
the first two periods while the Kings fired 27 on Maracle.
</P>
<P>
   It was Murray's goal that made it clear the Kings wouldn't be
challenged. Atlanta (7-17-2) had won two straight before dropping
an overtime game to last-year's expansion team Nashville on Sunday.
The Thrashers play San Jose on Friday and the Mighty Ducks on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes after Murray's goal that Galley scored
on the power play. With former King Ray Farraro in the penalty box
for interfering with Storr, Galley crushed a 25-footer that sailed
between Maracle's leg for the Kings third goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the play Bryan Smolinski recorded his team-leading 19 assists
and is on a pace for a career-high 56.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Kings were 21 for 115 on the power play,
sixth best in the NHL.

STUMPEL WILL STAY HOME FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings were hoping to take injured
Jozef Stumpel and Stephane Fiset on the team's upcoming four-city
trip, but it looks like there won't be enough practice time to make
it worthwhile for Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' top center has been sidelined since Nov. 6 with a
hernia that required surgery. The team is hoping to have him back
by Christmas but decided the trip to Detroit, Montreal, New Jersey
and New York would not help his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The team will not skate today before traveling to Detroit for
Friday's game against the Red Wings. The Kings fly after the game
to Montreal and will not work out before Saturday's game against
the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are scheduled to take Sunday off and practice Monday
in New Jersey. They play the Devils on Tuesday and the New York
Rangers on Wednesday but will not practice before that game.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who has participated in two light workouts this past
week, will remain in Los Angeles and continue physical therapy at
the Iceoplex in North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hope to have Fiset as a backup for the game against
the Canadiens. Montreal is Fiset's hometown. Quebec is home for
Marcel Cousineau, who has been the Kings' backup goalie in Fiset's
absence. Fiset, sidelined one month with a deep bone bruise on his
right hand, has been working out with the club the past week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Welcome aboard: Before Wednesday's game, Atlanta acquired
forward Shean Donovan from the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for
goaltender Rick Tabaracci. Donovan, who had one goal in 18 games
with Colorado this season, almost had one four minutes into the
first period Wednesday against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Jamie Storr with a 25-footer, but the play was waived
off when Andreas Karlsson was whistled for holding
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick Whistles: Ziggy Palffy, the Kings' leading scorer with
26 points, tested his sore lower back Wednesday by skating for 10
minutes. He will make the trip, but the team is not sure whether he
will play Friday in Detroit. . . . With two minutes remaining in
the first period, the Kings Bryan Smolinski shot a puck into the
stands that sailed over the restaurant on the north end and into
the luxury suites on the third level. It was the first puck to land
there this season. . . . Zack Newell of Simi Valley was the Kings
honorary captain for Wednesday night's game.

O'NEAL PRAISES BARKLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Shaquille O'Neal's last on-court meeting
with Charles Barkley mutated into a wrestling match on the Compaq
Center floor. But the Los Angeles Lakers' O'Neal expressed nothing
but respect and sympathy Wednesday night upon hearing Barkley would
retire in the wake of a severe left-knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, he's always going to be one of the greatest
forwards ever,'' said O'Neal, a one-time Olympic teammate of
Barkley's. ``A lot of people bring up that nonsense that because he
doesn't have a ring, he's not a great player. I find that not true.
(John) Stockton and (Karl) Malone are great players also; they
don't have rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Barkley's a good friend, good person, good player and
I'm going to miss him. I hope this is not his last year, but if it
is his last year, I'm behind him 100 percent. To me, he's one of
the greatest forwards ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played with a lot of enthusiasm, he played with a lot of
heart. That's what I liked about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The news caught the Lakers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson called the awkward end to Barkley's career
``a sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles has been a great player in the NBA, one of the premier
players in this league the last 12 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forget the medal: Speaking of the Dream Team, O'Neal said
that if he's offered one of the remaining three spots on next
year's roster, he'll pass it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My seasons have been so rigorous, my summer has been time for
me to just get some rest. Get a lot of rest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the team doesn't need him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got Tim (Duncan) and Alonzo (Mourning), that should be
enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal won a gold medal with the 1996 U.S. Olympic team and
another with a Junior Olympics squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already got two gold medals,'' he said. ``I gladly
appreciate it. Thanks for picking me the first time, but this time
I'll probably decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that decision was final, O'Neal hedged, saying
``probably. Most likely.'' Then he added, mysteriously, ``but
things may change.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dribbles: Jackson gave his players the day off today,
providing another rare break in a busy week. The Lakers travel to
Vancouver on Friday for a Saturday-afternoon game, then return to
Los Angeles to play the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, completing a
stretch of five games in eight days.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The irony is almost too great to be true.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending his 16 years in the NBA, Charles Barkley played his last
game in the same city where his career began.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley ruptured a quadriceps tendon in his left knee Wednesday
in the first quarter of the Rockets' 83-73 loss to the Philadelphia
76ers at First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the big fella in the sky wanted me to finish right
where I started,'' said Barkley. ``There were a lot of people here
tonight who saw me play my first game and saw me play my last game.
I do think it was supposed to happen like this. It was supposed to
end in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where it all began _ at least professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted fifth overall in the 1984 NBA draft, Barkley was known
as ``Boy Gorge'' and ``the Round Mound of Rebound'' after his
spectacular career at Auburn, where he often tipped the scales at
over 300 pounds. Barkley joined a Philadelphia team that included
such NBA stars as Julius Erving and Moses Malone. Some questioned
whether the 6-6 Barkley, who played center at Auburn, could make it
as a power forward in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barkley looks like Wes Unseld, but he jumps like a young
Julius,'' said then-Knicks coach Hubie Brown, comparing Barkley to
Unseld, a former Washington Bullet who played center in the NBA
despite standing only 6-7. ``Combine that body and that
explosiveness, and you have an unstoppable force.''
</P>
<P>
   Which pretty much describes Barkley's career, both on and off
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was what NBA types like to call a 'tweener _ a player
who is between positions because of a lack of height. But he was
far from a 'tweener in the public eye. No, Barkley is one of those
players you either love or hate. There was no middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   And that's because Barkley has never been hesitant to speak his
mind on any subject. That outspoken nature is what caused Barkley
to demand trades, first to Phoenix prior to the 1992-93 season and
then to Houston before 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is when a guy talks to me and disagrees
with me, then he turns around and writes bad stuff about me just
because my opinions differ from his,'' Barkley said. ``I don't like
the word controversial. What is controversial? Just because our
opinions are different, I don't look at myself as controversial. I
feel like I'm just like everyone else. Some things I say, people
agree with; some things I say, they don't agree with.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the normal American way. But when you're famous,
you can't be like that. That's the sad thing. That's probably the
only thing I hate about being famous, that you really can't voice
your opinion and be yourself, because then you get the tag for
being outspoken and controversial. But the regular guy on the
street says something I say, then it's all right. But because I'm
in the limelight, then I'm being controversial. That bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's off the court.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the greatness of what he accomplished on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his relative lack of height, Barkley led the league in
rebounding once (1986-87, 14.6 rebounds), averaged less than 10
rebounds only once (his rookie year, 8.6 rebounds) and is one of
only three players to have over 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and
4,000 assists (Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, both
7-footers, are the others). He was named the NBA's Most Valuable
Player in 1993, when he led the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals in
his first season in the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   He was named one of the NBA's top 50 players of all time in 1997
and is the 13th-leading scorer in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley twice won Olympic gold medals, including 1992 with the
original Dream Team that plowed through the field in Barcelona,
Spain, sparking the worldwide boom in basketball. He added his
second gold in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley is perceived to have one big void on his resume _ he
never won an NBA championship. While other greats of his generation
_ Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and
David Robinson _ have led their teams to titles, Barkley has never
captured one.
</P>
<P>
   He came close in 1993, but the Suns lost to the Bulls in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley, contrary to his competitive nature, claims that not
winning a championship is not a concern. He looks back on his life,
which began in tiny Leeds, Ala., and is amazed at where he finds
himself today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said. ``I feel that I've had the perfect life
because of where I came from. People keep throwing this thing out
there about the championship. Hey, let me tell you something _ you
grow up in Leeds, Ala., poor, the championship is the furthest
thing from your mind. You just want to make a success out of your
life. I have to look at the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a basketball standpoint, yes, I would like to win a
championship. But I'm not going to let basketball dictate my
success or failures in life. My life, to me, has been perfect
because my only goal in life was to take care of my mother and my
grandmother. Now you can throw my wife and daughter in there, and
my two brothers. But that was my No. 1 goal in life. When I started
playing basketball, I prayed hard every night. I said, `Give me a
chance to make life better for my mother and my grandmother.'
That's it. Everything else after that has been cake. People try to
tell me what I think and what I feel. I know what I think and what
I feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A championship would be great, but it's not the most important
thing to me. Not even close. My only goal in life was making life
better for my family because growing up really poor is not fun.
It's not fun not having things everyone else has. It's not fun
wearing hand-me-downs and things like that. That motivated me all
the time.''

WISCONSIN, DON'T WRITE OFF WILLINGHAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Russia is better equipped for Y2K than
Stanford is for Ron Dayne. Inasmuch as anybody's talking about the
Rose Bowl at all, that's what they're saying.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyrone Willingham is bothered by the public perception that
his Cardinal football team is a bug that big, bad Wisconsin is
going to wipe out on New Year's Day, he had a funny way of showing
it Wednesday during a press conference at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham smiled when someone broached the matter of his team
being 10{-point underdogs in the eyes of Vegas bookmakers and more
overmatched than that in the minds of some pundits.
</P>
<P>
   To know Willingham's story is to understand why being written
off doesn't make him wrought-up or reticent. He can smile
unselfconsciously despite the braces on his lower teeth and the
lowered expectations of the public because he knows things have a
way of getting straightened out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would have bet on an African-American woman earning
her Masters degree from Columbia in the early 1950s. Fewer still
would put any money down on the slightly built boy she bore going
on to become a quarterback good enough to break down defenses and
stereotypes at a Big Ten school in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say: Where there's a Willingham, there's a
way.
</P>
<P>
   There's an explanation other than parity or peculiarity for how
a Cardinal team that won only two Pacific-10 games in 1998 is the
king of the conference a year later: The players are passionate and
prepared and persistent and opportunistic and selfless.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they are a reflection of their fifth-year head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was named the conference Coach of the Year, Willingham
got called all kinds of things that didn't have nearly as nice a
ring to them.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back losing seasons gave some Stanford boosters amnesia.
They forgot all about the back-to-back bowl seasons Willingham
presided over at the start of his Cardinal head-coaching tenure and
wondered aloud why the football team hadn't started stockpiling
conference championships like the school's tennis teams and
swimming teams and women's volleyball and basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   After Willingham directed the Cardinal to the Liberty Bowl in
1995 and the Aloha Bowl in 1996, it didn't take someone with an IQ
of 153 to see the next logical step was the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham, shut out in his efforts to get to the Rose Bowl as a
player at Michigan State, was among those who thought his third
year at The Farm would be a charm. Instead, the Cardinal lost five
Pac-10 games by an average margin of 15.4 points. The following
year was worse: six conference losses by an average of 15.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   For Willingham, those 5-6 and 3-8 campaigns were like a riddle.
He was grasping for a deeper meaning until this year supplied an
answer that made sense of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it now and see going to the Rose Bowl wasn't meant
to be after the first couple of years,'' he said. ``It might not
have been as rewarding as it is now, accomplishing it after two
years of difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for Willingham, growing up a child of segregation
in the South. His mother, now deceased, worked 31 years as an
elementary-school teacher. Her influence was great but her world
relatively puny, for the longest time not extending beyond the
African-American community in Jacksonville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Boundaries of race also restricted Willingham's late father,
Nathaniel. He sold real estate but not in the wealthier, white
neighborhoods. They might as well have been on Mars for all the
access he had to them.
</P>
<P>
   The world widened for Willingham, 45, but he had to squeeze
through small cracks in existing walls to make it so. He was barely
5-6 when he finished high school and weighed 140 pounds soaking
wet.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of his high school coach, Willingham sent out 100
letters to colleges, asking football coaches not for a free ride
but simply for a few minutes of their time. He got back two
replies, from the University of Toledo and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham walked on at Michigan State and earned three varsity
letters each in football and baseball and one undergraduate degree.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years after beginning his coaching career as a
graduate assistant at his alma mater, Willingham will become the
first African-American head coach to grace the sidelines at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on his way to integrating the Rose Bowl
coaching ranks. Unlike in Jacksonville, N.C., or in East Lansing,
Mich., it didn't create much of a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham answered questions for an hour Wednesday before the
topic of race first came up. Was that in itself a sign of progress,
we wondered aloud?
</P>
<P>
   Willingham flashed that all-knowing, all-teeth-showing smile
again, the one he reserves for those who go jumping to conclusions.

JOHN OLERUD SIGNING IS RELIEF FROM GRIFFEY MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since he was the only good news in a town where news
has been unrelievedly bad, there is an urge to build the statue of
John Olerud now, skipping the formality of his first Mariners
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected by the world and consumed with self-loathing, Seattle,
onetime national sweetheart whose makeup is messed and nylons are
backwards, desperately needed a hug.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Olerud was willing to give up New York for his
hometown team and also happens to be one of baseball's gentlemen
... well, hang on here, we're about one slobber away from bursting
into Dick Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. OK, I'm composed now.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the baseball virtues he brings to Seattle and the
Mariners, Olerud's free-agent signing begins the local validation
of Pat Gillick as general manager, offers evidence there is passion
among ownership for something besides tax money and helps untangle
the antler-lock between the Mariners and Cincinnati Reds over Ken
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness among all sides to get a Griffey deal done fairly
bristles. Mariners management is tired of Griffey and his demands.
Griffey is equally fed up with the club. Ohio, home to the NFL's
worst football as well as Pete Rose, the most annoying man in
sports, is eager to be lit up by the presence of Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstances and the consequences of the deal defy
haste. So, in the meantime, the poker game is worthy of its own
admission ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Griffey's ability to force a trade via his 10-and-5
rights, the Mariners lost leverage in any trade talks. And because
Griffey a) has only one year left on his contract; b) would cost at
least $150 million in a long-term extension; and c) has the right
to refuse a trade to a team he doesn't like, only a handful of
teams could even consider trading for him.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is poor for the Mariners. It forces Gillick into
the awkward position of having to create a market for the game's
best player.
</P>
<P>
   The one automatic entry in the market was the Reds, who employ
Griffey's father and operate in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But one team doesn't really make a market. Although other teams
have made offers, all have been of the low-ball variety to test the
Mariners' degree of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks, Gillick has attempted to show no hint of
desperation, rejecting all offers but maintaining there is still
serious interest from multiple clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It is classic baseball poker, heavy on the bluff. His GM
counterpart in Cincinnati, Jim Bowden, knows the game and knows
Gillick has a shaky hand. So he periodically professes in the media
that the deal is doomed, just to see if he can make sweat appear
above Gillick's upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bowden claimed to have withdrawn all offers,
citing the need to make moves elsewhere. Wednesday, Bowden was back
dealing with Gillick.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to a deal has been the Mariners' refusal to
let prospective trading partners negotiate a long-term extension
with Griffey prior to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick's explanation is vague, something about messing up trade
talks. More specifically, if Gillick were to allow one team the
right to talk, other bidders would fall away, presuming that a
trade is all but done. But what happens if no contract agreement is
reached between Griffey and the prospective team?
</P>
<P>
   Gillick will be left with even less leverage than before, and
perhaps no market at all, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick needs to have the deal he wants almost in hand before
taking the risk of allowing contract conversation. Even then, the
risk might be too great. He might choose to accept a lesser deal,
rather than chance the blow-up of the entire Griffey market.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, and perhaps as soon as the end of baseball's annual
winter meetings that begin Friday, Griffey seems destined to be
dealt to the Reds. The logic for the teams and Griffey is almost
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   With a new stadium and its short right-field porch coming for
2003, and the generational link to the days of the Big Red Machine,
Bowden cannot help but end up with Griffey, even if he ends up
bidding only against himself. Bowden must lie awake at night
wondering what it would be like for Griffey to be chasing Hank
Aaron's home run record in another uniform, all because he wouldn't
part with a guy named Pokey Reese.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risk for the Mariners grows a little each day. As
free agents begin to sign with new clubs, and more trades are
completed, contending teams will have patched holes and be less
tempted to rock the boat with a Griffey bid.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is said to be growing more impatient, which could mean
that he will be uncooperative with the Mariners as far as accepting
a trade.
</P>
<P>
   And the time spent on Griffey means less time resolving the
situation of Rodriguez, the player that many more teams will bid on
than Griffey, because the Mariners control his rights.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure builds. The drama grows. Maybe a new card player at
the meetings will take the pot.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what happens, Olerud is around to offer a hug to
the onetime sweetheart.

CARDINAL RULE: STANFORD SURPRISES DESPITE EVERYTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona's speedy start is not a surprise. The Wildcats always
play well early, their starting lineup oozes NBA talent, and they
have one of the nation's best players in power fowrard Michael
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford's 5-0 record borders on astounding considering the
competition, the departure of four starters, the assimilation of
two superb freshmen (Casey Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt) and an
oft-injured sophomore (Jason Collins), and the loss of its best
player, forward Mark Madsen, for a month because of a pulled
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Cardinal has beaten Duke and Auburn, and it's a
Cincinnati loss away from No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, we set a lot of team goals,''
said Collins, a Harvard-Westlake grad. ``Especially because we lost
five seniors, we wanted to prove that we'd be at least as good as
least year, maybe better. People thought we would rebuild, that it
would take time. It hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   __ Fearless freshmen. Stanford had the best recruiting class in
the Pac-10 and one of the best in the nation. Jacobsen, of
Glendora, is thriving in coach Mike Montgomery's structured system
and averaging 11 points. Borchardt, perhaps the league's best
frontcourt recruit, is providing steady play off the bench; he had
15 points, six rebounds and hit a critical 3-pointer in the Wooden
Classic victory over Auburn. The Cardinal is so deep and talented
on the frontcourt, it's redshirting freshman forward Justin Davis,
who would play 15 minutes a game for UCLA or Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dominating defense. What the Cardinal lost in experience, it
gained in athleticism, especially in the frontcourt. It challenges
passing lanes, darts around screens and intimidates in the low
post. Opponents are shooting 28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Collins factor. Jason and Jarron are finally playing
together after Jason missed most of the last two seasons with knee
injuries. They're active, imposing and skilled _ the primary reason
Stanford has survived without Madsen, who was hurt with a few
minutes left in the Duke game. (The Cardinal was trailing at the
time.) Jarron's averaging 13 points and 7.4 rebounds. Jason's
averaging 9.6 points and 8.8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Jason said. ``We're trying to do our best, shut
people down defensively and be dominant in the low post on
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not so fast: Before anointing Arizona a national-title
contender, consider this: The Wildcats have been one of the best
November teams in the nation in the '90s and it usually doesn't
mean a thing. They won the NIT in 1991-92 and 1995-96 and lost in
the Sweet 16 both times. No question, they're talented and
well-coached, but it's difficut to maintain a high level of play
for four months.
</P>
<P>
   __ Old friends: Duke freshman Carlos Boozer is averaging 7.1
points and 4.4 rebounds in 16.7 minutes. Jason Kapono, the player
UCLA signed after it lost Boozer, is averaging 12.7 points and 3.7
rebounds in 29 minutes. Not a bad trade.
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA assistant and Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar, now
the boss at Saint Louis, has a huge game Sunday against Missouri in
the TWA Dome. Romar's Billikens, 4-2, are in hot pursuit of 6-9
megatalent Daruis Miles, of East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In seven games for Alabama, Schea Cotton is averaging 12.6
points and shooting 23.1 percent from 3-point range. Oh, yeah, he
also has 12 assists and 23 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush, JaRon's brother, scored 16 points Tuesday night for
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Harrick has lost highly touted freshman Ezra
Williams for the season (barring appeal) and he's not happy about
it. Williams was cleared by the NCAA last summer. But before the
season, Georgia learned Williams hadn't passed the science portion
of the Georgia High School Graduation Test _ meaning he was not a
high school graduate. Williams stayed in school, did not practice
with the team, and passed the test Nov. 16, according to the Athens
Daily News. The Bulldogs figured Williams would become eligible
after the fall semester. The NCAA disagreed and Harrick fumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfathomable to me how they could do that to a young
man,'' Harrick told reporters. ``It's beyond my comprehension.
We'll get our lawyer involved and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he didn't call it a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the Pac-10: Two players have left Arizona because of
freshman guard Gilbert Arenas' sparkling play: Ruben Douglas and
Luke Recker, who transferred to Iowa this week. Not bad for the
under-recruited Grant High grad, who chose Arizona over Kansas
State. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Easiest roadtrip of the Pac-10 season: Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Toughest: Oregon. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Five of Cal's top-six scorers are freshmen, including Fairfax
High's Joe Shipp. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis Turner's foot injury is a major blow to USC's shallow
bench. Greg Lakey and Shannon Swillis, where have you gone? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Oregon meets Cal State Northridge on Saturday in a matchup of
the Ducks' current coach (Ernie Kent) and the man who wanted the
job (Bobby Braswell). . . .
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out two weeks (strained knee), Oregon State
freshman Brian Jackson had 12 points and four rebounds in his
college debut against Colorado State. If Jackson plays to his
stellar reputation, he could push the Beavers into the league's
upper division.

CSUN LOSES FLOWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Aaron Flowers _ whose name became synonymous with
Cal State Northridge football over the past four years, first as a
player and then as a coach _ accepted an assistant's position at
Big Sky Conference rival Montana State on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough because I wanted to build something here,'' Flowers
said about moving on. ``But there's a lot of things (at CSUN) that
are uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, 24, will coach the Bobcats' quarterbacks, the same job
he held at CSUN this past season, when he guided sophomore Marcus
Brady to a 3,000-yard season. Flowers was contacted by new Montana
State head coach Mike Kramrer about the job two weeks ago, and he
was offered the position Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it (Tuesday night). It's a pleasant surpise,''
Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers played only two years at Northridge after transferring
from Valley College in the mid-1990s, but he holds school records
for passing yards in a game, season and career. He had a record 500
yards against Eastern Washington in 1996, a record 3,540 yards that
season and his 6,766 yards is the career mark.
</P>
<P>
   His six passing touchdowns in the Matadors' '97 season opener
against Division I Boise State is also a record.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers became a part-time graduate assistant coach in '98 and
was instrumental in Brady's success as a freshman; Brady threw for
2,983 yards and 26 touchdowns and was named the Newcomer of the
Year in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   __ Other changes:Kearin, who is expected to have the interim
title taken away and be hired full-time within the next two weeks,
said he expects the rest of the staff to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, they're all planning on coming back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin couldn't comment upon the status of assistants Craig Wall
and Keith Borges, who were paid by the university but didn't coach
this past season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Confident QB: Rudy Camano says he's not crazy _ just
confident.
</P>
<P>
   Camano, who is attending Mt. San Antonio College, is
transferring to Cal State Northridge for the spring semester and
he's intending to become the Matadors' starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Camano said, he knows CSUN has Brady, who set school
records for completions and attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I didn't want to be far from home,'' said Camano,
who played at Santa Fe High in Santa Fe Springs. ``I'm just going
to go out and do what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Camano, a 6-foot-1, 185-pound right-hander, played at Mt. SAC
last year but didn't this season, meaning he'll be an incoming
sophomore. He signed with Iowa State out of high school but never
enrolled, and he was offered scholarships by Syracuse and West
Virginia this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he's looking forward to the challenge from Camano,
who will participate in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has two other quarterbacks on scholarship: Mitch Ryerson,
who will be a senior next year, and Brandon Martinovic, who will be
a redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   __ Swan song:Brennen Swanson, a defensive end/linebacker who
finished his career with a school-record 31{ sacks, said he was
just happy to be nominated for the Buck Buchanan Award as Division
I-AA's top defensive player. The award went to Troy State noseguard
Al Lucas on Monday in a ceremony in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' said Swanson, a two-time first-team All-Big
Sky Conference selection. ``I'm honored just to have been
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, who had 12{ sacks and 68 tackles this season, graduates
this month and he said he's interested in pursuing a pro career. At
6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, he's undersized but not unbowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to give it a shot,'' Swanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson and four teammates are working out for a New York Giants
scout today. The others: defensive backs Chazz Moore and Mel
Miller, receiver Aaron Arnold and defensive lineman Shawnbay Jones.
</P>
<P>
   __ Just the stats: Arnold, a senior receiver, finished the
season as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving
yards and receiving touchdowns. His final career totals: 195
receptions, 2,660 yards and 26 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's final total of 3,326 passing yards this season ranks
second all-time for a single season.
</P>
<P>
   Senior running back Jaumal Bradley, meanwhile, moved to sixth on
the school's single-season chart with 170 yards in the season
finale against Northern Arizona on Nov. 13. Bradley, who finished
with 907 in nine games, also had 1,281 career yards, placing him
sixth all-time.

DUST OR BUST

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Through all the dust, thousands of backcountry
miles and years of gripping the wheels of 4x4 rigs, Harry Lewellyn
remains as giddy as ever driving off-highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I open Mother Nature's backdoor to a lifetime of
responsible adventure and pleasure,'' said Lewellyn, 60, of Costa
Mesa, founder of Ecological 4-Wheeling Adventures. His private
business offers four-wheel-drive trips throughout California and
Mexico, as well as backcountry-driving courses at area community
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me how I can do the same trail over and over
again,'' he said. ``And what I find is that nothing gives me
greater pleasure than to watch an ocotillo (plant) grow from just
breaking the ground to spreading its thorny arms to 10 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   What does get old is the unflattering image to which his sport
is tied. Lewellyn explained:
</P>
<P>
   ``It primarily revolves around a preconception of how
four-wheel-drive vehicles are used _ irresponsibly, beat 'em, bang
'em, bend 'em, roll 'em over. Which is not the case with the modern
SUV (sport-utility vehicle) owner. It's a point of pride and a hell
of an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals, 4WD clubs and services, and government agencies _
such as the Off-Highway Vehicle Division of the state Department of
Parks and Recreation _ strive to change the portrayal of the sport
as reckless and damaging to the environment. With today's profound
interest in SUVs and drivers seeking pursuits off the blacktop,
that's an important consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the backcountry as it was intended to be used; it's a
leave-no-trace approach,'' said Lewellyn, who was contracted to map
the entire state's off-highway-vehicle system and produced the
``California OHV Guidebook'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Off-highway adventurers can drive on public lands _ National
Forest, Bureau of Land Management and state property _ that is not
posted as closed to vehicles. (Motorcycles, ATVs, dune buggies,
snowmobiles and other rigs not considered ``street legal'' must be
registered with what is known as a green sticker; money from green
stickers fund California's off-highway vehicle program and its
seven State Vehicular Recreation Areas.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the best ways to get introduced to the world of
four-wheeling is to take a 4x4 course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for people buying into the popular
sport-utility-vehicle market and a way to find out how 4WD
enthusiasts can use, not abuse, backcountry roads and trails,''
said Jack Raudy, an Off-Highway Vehicle Division spokesman. ``They
can lead you further into 4WD clubs in the area, if you're
interested in joining.''
</P>
<P>
   Just such a course is offered at 8 a.m. Dec. 18 at Hungry Valley
State Vehicular Recreation Area north of Pyramid Lake, off the
Smokey Bear Road exit of the Golden State Freeway (5). A 90-minute
slide presentation is followed by four hours of ``memorable
hands-on driving from beginner level to expert . . . including
about a half-dozen obstacles faced in situational backcountry
driving,'' Raudy said. Cost is $65 per student. Reservations: (818)
705-3930. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WILD RIDES
</P>
<P>
   California operates three Southland sites _ State Vehicular
Recreation Areas _ within its off-highway vehicle program. Camping
is available at each:
</P>
<P>
   __ Hungry Valley SVRA: 17,800 acres of hilly terrain north of
Pyramid Lake ideal for all types of OHV experience, from beginner
to expert; (661) 248-7007.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oceano Dunes SVRA: Suited for sandy OHV recreation, including
dune buggies, the 3,100-acre site is located outside Grover Beach
in San Luis Obispo County; (805) 473-7230.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ocotillo Wells SVRA: A mammoth area at more 70,000 acres, it
features a slew of desert-riding opportunities; (760) 767-5391.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The images are gripping. George Mallory's corpse _
alabaster and statuesque _ preserved nearly intact for 75 years,
face down on the North Face of Mount Everest at 27,000 feet. One
unhurt leg crossed over a broken one as if for protection. Fingers
clutching the talus in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The story is enthralling. Did Mallory and his partner, Andrew
Irvine, reach the summit of Everest in 1924?
</P>
<P>
   Three in a series of new books from members of an expedition
that found Mallory's body in May address the topic. One contends
the climbers could have reached the peak; the other title proposes
it is highly unlikely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest: The Search for Mallory &AMP; Irvine'' (The
Mountaineers; $29.95) by Jochen Hemmleb, Larry A. Johnson and Eric
R. Simonson in no way concedes Mallory and Irvine succeeded but
eliminates some of the arguments that the pair couldn't possibly
have reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear from the new findings is that Mallory and Irvine
fell while tied together by rope and descending in the dark
(Mallory had his sun goggles in his pocket) above 26,000 feet.
Mallory suffered severe head injuries and a broken leg; Irvine's
body has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The authors accumulated circumstantial evidence _ letters,
oxygen cylinders, the facts of weather and topography and a
description of where they were when last seen. But there's nothing
resembling a smoking gun; the camera Mallory took with him was not
found. A photo he brought of his wife was found neither in his
pocket nor at the summit, where he had hoped to place it if he
reached the top.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1999 expedition, the accepted belief was that Mallory
and Irvine did not have enough oxygen to reach the peak. This logic
apparently was incorrect; oxygen cylinders and a letter listing
available air supplies were located, which points to the likelihood
the pair had enough oxygen to summit.
</P>
<P>
   The authors are reverential toward Mallory, a climbing icon, but
could they have an unconscious bias to discover that Mallory did
indeed scale the peak? It's natural to hope so; the story is so
compelling we're rooting for Mallory and Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   No one can doubt the bravery and will of the old-time
mountaineers. They climbed with primitive equipment. Back then, the
idea of roping climbers together all the way up was unheard of. The
1999 party was shocked to find how poorly clothed Mallory was; his
thin layers of apparel appeared more appropriate for a picnic in
the Alps than a high-altitude climb.
</P>
<P>
   The authors wrote, ``Did they? No one knows. Surely what
matters, what warrants our attention and our awe, is the scale of
their achievement given the resources available to them, their
astonishing strength and grit, the indomitability of their
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the detective work, the 205-page ``Ghosts of Everest'' is
a splendid read. Its writers' alternate description of the 1924
odyssey with the 1999 excursion to show the commonality _ the
dangers of falling and weather, the tiny margin for error _ with
the contrast _ equipment, technique, planning. Together it makes
the 1924 achievement all the greater, whether it included summiting
or not.
</P>
<P>
   The color photographs are breathtaking; two photos of Mallory's
body are worth the price of the book in the tale they tell. One
could get vertigo from other shots from the separate journeys. To
be certain, ``Ghosts of Everest '' is a fine book, but it is not
definitive. Our rating: { &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The arguments by Conrad Anker are more persuasive in ``The Lost
Explorer: Finding Mallory on Mount Everest'' with David Roberts
(Simon &AMP; Schuster; $22). Anker, acknowledged as the best technical
climber on the 1999 expedition, found Mallory's body.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that Mallory and Irvine did not have enough time to
reach the summit. Although no one knows when the pair left the
highest Everest camp June 8, 1924, it is unlikely to have been
before 6:30 a.m. Mallory did not have a flashlight and climbers in
his day did not start early; today 2 a.m. is a common time to
depart camp. A successful climb would have required that Mallory
and Irvine climbed significantly faster than modern climbers do.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario by Tom Holzel, a historian of Everest lore,
calculated that the pair could have reached the top if they climbed
204 feet per hour. Anker himself, a fast climber, ascended 165 feet
per hour with modern equipment, techniques, assistance and
training.
</P>
<P>
   But Anker believes the team's biggest obstacle was the Second
Step, a 90-foot sheer wall where there is now a permanent ladder.
Anker free-climbed it but thinks Mallory and Irvine could not have
climbed without better ropes and modern climbing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Mallory and Irvine had miraculously climbed the Second
Step, they would have been stranded above it,'' he wrote. ``Few
climbing ropes at the time were longer than 100 feet. Had they
doubled the rope around the anchoring boulder at the top and
rappelled the Step, the rope would never have reached. Nor would
they have been able to pull the rope down from below . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The contention is persuasive. The counter-argument _ a belief in
superhuman effort and willpower _ sounds like wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Anker's 191-page book is well-done, with a respectful look at
Mallory. Yet the black-and-white photos aren't as memorable. Our
rating: {
</P>
<P>
   Peter Firstbrook's ``Lost on Everest: The Search for Mallory &AMP;
Irvine'' (Contemporary Books; $24.95) provides color and history
but adds little to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Firstbrook, like Anker, speculates the pair probably did not
have enough time to reach the top. But he contends they could have
overcome the Second Step, based on achievements made during a 1960
climb by a team of Chinese climbers. (Anker, noting the lack of
corroborating photos, believes the Chinese neither climbed the
Second Step nor reached the summit.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost on Everest '' portrays Mallory as an idealistic man who
had achieved little success and become obsessed with the idea of
climbing Everest. Firstbrook, like the other authors, depicts him
as absent-minded, sometimes nearly reckless. (Mallory took the
blame for the deaths of seven Sherpas during a 1922 attempt on
Everest.)
</P>
<P>
   Readers fascinated with Everest lore will find Firstbrook's
224-page account worthy. But don't expect to learn much about
whether Everest was climbed in 1924. Our rating: {

DUCKS FORCED TO CHUCK CHECKING LINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Early in the season, the line of Mike Leclerc,
Antti Aalto and Ladislav Kohn was one of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks'
most effective, earning praise from coach Craig Hartsburg for its
aggressive forechecking and impressive work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been hard to keep the three healthy at the same time.
Leclerc had elbow surgery and missed 11 games in late October and
early November. Kohn injured his groin on Nov. 26 and has missed
the past five games. Now Aalto is expected to be out at least 1-2
weeks with a strained left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dropping like flies,'' joked Kohn, who hopes to return
in 1-2 weeks. ``Jimmy Mac (McKenzie) replaced Mike and he broke his
hand (and missed 10 games).''
</P>
<P>
   With Aalto and Kohn out, Hartsburg started a checking line of
Leclerc, Tony Hrkac and Jeff Nielsen on Wednesday night. He also
moved winger Ted Donato to center and played him between Jeremy
Stevenson and Stu Grimson.
</P>
<P>
   Aalto was relieved that an MRI on his elbow didn't show any torn
ligaments. The second-year center was fearful after last Saturday's
game in Phoenix that he had suffered torn ligaments, an injury that
required surgery in January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better everyday,'' Aalto said of his elbow. ``I
hope I can be ready in two weeks, but I have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Olausson sits: Fredrik Olausson has been a mainstay on the
Ducks' defense since returning to the team last season, but he sat
out his second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said he sat out the veteran on Saturday in Phoenix
because it would have been his third game in four nights. Wednesday
the coach said he didn't want to change his lineup after the
Anaheim defense played so well against the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys just have to wait their turn,'' said Hartsburg, who
recently scratched Jason Marshall two games in a row. ``Last year,
we had guys banged up and struggling and we had no choice (but to
play them). This year we are going to take advantage of our
depth.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Credit McInnis: Paul Kariya, Teemu Selanne and Olausson got
most of the credit for the Ducks' powerful power play last year,
but Marty McInnis played a key role as well. The winger scored 11
of his 18 goals on the power play. This season, he has scored just
twice and is as frustrated as anybody on the unit that came into
Wednesday's game ranked 27th in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be pressing because we know it has cost us a couple
of games,'' said McInnis, who added the Ducks must start taking
advantage of aggressive penalty killing units. ``If you can beat a
guy, you can use that aggressiveness to your advantage. . . . We
haven't been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McInnis remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get any worse,'' he said. ``Once we get a couple of
goals our confidence will come back.''

KARIYA BROTHERS LONE HIGHLIGHT OF TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Kariya brothers facing each other for the
first time might have been the feel-good story of the week, but it
didn't take long to realize that Wednesday night's game was just
another chapter in the saga of the unpredictiable and
underachieving Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim was forced to huff and puff just to escape with a 2-2
tie versus the undermanned Vancouver Canucks before 12,488 at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kariyas picked up points. Steve setup Vancouver's first
goal, while Paul scored Anaheim's first. Both also picked up
penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we were missing was a fight,'' quipped Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Ducks' struggles against seemingly overmatched
opponents was the real story.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a special night from the special teams just to earn
a point.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-1 early in the third period, Anaheim's 27th-ranked
power-play unit tied the game when Steve Rucchin got in good
position in the slot and converted Teemu Selanne's pass at 5:06. It
marked only the third time this season that Anaheim has scored two
power play goals in a game and the first time since Oct. 21 in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the bright things about the night,'' said Selanne,
who assisted on both goals. ``It was a relief, we have to believe
we can score.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the game was played at even strength, power plays were
opportunities the Ducks couldn't afford to squander.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to see these kind of games,'' Selanne said.
``It was a frustrating game, there were 10 guys in the middle of
the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' improving penalty-killing unit killed off three more
penalties and has killed 37 of the last 40 power play chances
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On nights like this, when nothing is happening, special teams
are so, so important,'' Selanne said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks, despite injuries to Mark Messier (knee), Alexander
Mogilny (back), Adrian Aucoin (groin) and Mattis Ohlund (eye
surgery), have led the Northwest Division for most of the season.
Even a roster full of rookies was more than enough to give the
Ducks all they could handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks were content to play safe, conservative hockey all
night. Vancouver generated little offensive pressure, but neither
did the Ducks as the two teams did their best to lull each other
and the sparse crowd to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``To casual observers, it looks boring, but there was no room on
the ice,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said. ``We had to fight for
every inch of the ice and so did they. It wasn't pretty, but it
wasn't because of a lack of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hebert didn't face a shot for the first 6{ minutes and
didn't look ready when he finally saw action. Steve Kariya made a
behind-the-back tip pass to Markus Naslund, who beat a
stunned-looking Hebert through the legs from the left circle at
8:32.
</P>
<P>
   Icings and offsides dominated the second period, but the Ducks'
low-voltage power play broke a 25-play drought when Paul Kariya
converted a penalty _ taken by his brother, of all people.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kariya came into the game with only eight penalty minutes,
but he was called for elbowing Niclas Havelid and could only watch
as Paul's one-timer deflected off Peter Schaefer and past Garth
Snow at 11:24.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and Steve Kariya lined up next to each other to begin the
game, since Vancouver coach Marc Crawford started Steve at right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks lost another key member of their defense midway
through the second period when Pavel Trnka suffered a groin strain
and had to be helped to the dressing room. Anaheim is already
without Kevin Haller, who is out with a knee injury and is at least
1-2 weeks away from returning to action.

LOBBY WARNS CAPITOL HILL NOT TO OPPOSE CHINESE PACT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Following the meltdown of the Seattle trade talks,
the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a blunt warning
Wednesday to members of Congress: Any opposition to admitting China
into the World Trade Organization will come at a heavy political
price.
<P>
   This spring _ just months before the November congressional and
presidential elections _ Congress will vote on whether to grant
China permanent normal trading status to clear the way for its
long-sought admission to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is shaping up as a huge brawl between business and
environmental and labor groups that will put wavering members under
intense political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber President Thomas Donohue said the powerful business
lobby sees the China vote as critical to the U.S. economy, and
strongly implied that the chamber would withdraw campaign
contributions and other political support from members who vote
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're absent on this China vote, it's going to get very
expensive politically,'' Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you decide that this is the place where you're going to
cost this nation dearly with regard to national security and the
national economy,'' Donohue said, then members voting no ``may find
the 2000 elections more cumbersome than they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a free vote,'' Donohue added at a briefing for
reporters. ``You make this vote at your own peril.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration recently concluded an agreement _
widely viewed as highly favorable to U.S. business interests _
under which China will begin to open its huge markets as a quid pro
quo for U.S. support for its WTO admission.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional approval of China's admission into the WTO was not
considered in real danger until last week, when protests by labor
and environmental groups on the streets of Seattle preceded a
collapse of the widely touted talks among the WTO's 135 member
nations to start a new round of trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   These groups, joined by human rights advocates, want labor and
environmental standards incorporated into any new trade agreements,
and many consider China a top violator in each instance.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have made their opposition to China's WTO admission quite
clear already. ``It's a very, very important and consequential
fight for working people around the country,'' said Peggy Taylor,
legislative director for the AFL-CIO in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly how we're going to target it and what methods we'll
use are very much under discussion in the labor movement,'' Taylor
said. ``But we are coming out of Seattle with a change in the
public understanding of what's at stake in these trade fights, and
I think the China WTO will be a really important event in that
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber announced that it is targeting 66 congressional
districts, including several yet unidentified in the Bay Area, for
a grassroots business campaign to push the China pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no air war here, just going on the airwaves with
ads,'' said Willard Workman, the chamber's international trade
specialist. ``This will be district by district, in the streets.
This is going to be won.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, it's been labor that has won the grassroots
campaigns on trade, and the AFL-CIO's Taylor dismissed this latest
threat from the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't question that this is a high priority for the business
community and they'll throw a lot of resources into it,'' she said.
``I'm just not overwhelmed by their saying they're about to be out
with a big grassroots campaign, because I've heard this too many
times from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are split on trade, with centrist ``New Democrats''
such as Contra Costa's Ellen Tauscher and the Central Valley's Cal
Dooley strongly in favor of liberalization, while San Francisco's
Nancy Pelosi and the East Bay's George Miller side with unions and
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle represents environmental and labor groups' latest and
largest victory in a campaign that has been steadily gaining
momentum. In 1997, unions and environmentalists dealt an enormous
blow to the Clinton administration when Congress failed to approve
the administration's request for ``fast-track'' trade negotiating
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue argued that China will be different, because the China
pact offers tangible and specific benefits, promising a host of
U.S. industries increased access to China's enormous market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to deny that to the e-commerce people, are they
going to deny it to the bank people, to the agriculture people, to
the car people and their workers, to the telephone people?''
Donohue asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Valley's Dooley agreed, adding that 110 out of 205
Democrats voted this year for renewing China's ``normal'' trade
status and predicting that next year's China vote would hold 80 to
90 of those votes.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that unions and environmentalists have picked up
momentum, Dooley said Seattle also served as ``a call to arms for
more pro-trade forces, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fairly high level of complacency among constituent
groups that support our engagement with China,'' Dooley said, ``and
after what took place in the streets of Seattle, I think pro-trade
factions really fully understand that they have to be engaged in
making the case to members and to the American people on why we
should welcome China into the WTO.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, whose
presidential aspirations have been bolstered significantly by
contributors from Silicon Valley, took exception to one of their
priorities Wednesday, refusing to endorse a permanent ban on
Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a campaign swing through California, Bradley said
it would be irresponsible to do what several of his Republican
counterparts have done and forever rule out Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what the world is going to look like five or 10
years from now,'' Bradley told a group of reporters during an
interview near his northern New Jersey home. ``How can anyone say
never to anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a conference table in the principal's office of
Montclair High School (with an untouched hoagie at his side),
Bradley held court for nearly an hour on issues ranging from his
opposition to gay marriage to Pete Rose's controversial campaign to
enter baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's Internet position is at odds with some high-tech
entrepreneurs who fear that taxes might dampen e-commerce.
Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Steve Forbes have
both endorsed a permanent ban. Front-runners George W. Bush and
Bradley's Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore _ like Bradley _
support a temporary ban.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a week that Bradley has refused to
rule out future taxes, leaving him open to GOP charges that he is a
``tax-and-spend liberal.'' Last week, he told the Washington Post
that he would not foreclose the possibility of raising taxes if
needed to pay for his health care plan, though he added that he did
not foresee a any  &LR; need to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also prompted an attack from Gore, which Bradley
characterized Wednesday as a ``political cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not proposed increasing taxes; I do not propose
increasing taxes,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want honesty, I believe, from their politicians,''
Bradley said. ``When you are in charge of a multitrillion (dollar)
economy, you don't know which way it's going to turn. ... It would
be irresponsible to take the George Bush `no new taxes' pledge.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley arrives in Los Angeles Thursday for a speech on race.
Friday, he will travel to Sacramento and then to the San Francisco
Bay Area for three fund-raisers, as well as an environmental event
in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Gore holds a 2-to-1 lead over Bradley in
California. But Bradley says that will change when Californians
begin to focus on the race in February, and said his campaign's
emphasis on race, the environment, free trade and technology will
serve him well.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to expound on his opposition to gay marriage, Bradley
said, ``It is not only a legal state, but also a sacrament for a
number of religions.'' He said he supports domestic partnerships to
provide gays all the ``legal, financial (and) inheritance rights
that accrue the state of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether I will recognize gay union, it is how
you recognize gay union, and that is how I prefer to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whose views on the issue parallel his Democratic
rival's, said he opposes the measure on California's March 7 ballot
known as the ``Knight Initiative,'' which would prohibit the state
from recognizing gay marriages, saying it is ``divisive and
contributes to stigmatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to distinguish himself from Gore, Bradley said there are
differences on the issues _ such as health care and gun control _
that exemplify ``different styles of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   On both matters, Bradley said his own proposals are bolder, and
accused the vice president of being too cautious. ``In basketball,
we used to say that some people basically sit on a lead,'' he said.
``I think he's playing it too cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign wasted no time responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been on the court for the Democratic Party for the
last seven years, scoring points improving health care, building
schools, building a strong economy,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
said. ``It's been Sen. Bradley who has been in the stands, not even
on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the 55-minute session, Bradley, who played
professional basketball for the New York Knicks for 10 years, was
asked whether he supports a plea by Pete Rose, accused of gambling
on baseball, to be admitted to baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said with a pained, yet pensive expression.
``Probably not.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Conservative challenge to Miranda threatens to
restore brutish legal system
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has, dangerously, decided to revisit the
historic 1966 Miranda ruling. Dangerously, because it will be a
close call in the current conservative court whether this
fundamental protection against coerced confessions can survive.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda requires police to tell criminal suspects they may
refuse to answer investigators' questions and may have a lawyer
present when they are interrogated _ the familiar ``You have a
right to remain silent...'' liturgy of crime shows.
</P>
<P>
   The court established the rule to reduce the then-constant legal
wrangling over whether this confession or that was truly voluntary
or whether it had been beaten or scammed out of a suspect in
violation of the Constitution's protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   This late challenge to Miranda is based on a law Congress
enacted two years after the ruling, quashing the requirement. No
administration of either party has enforced the law, judging it
plainly unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had been panicked by police and prosecutors predicting
a general collapse of criminal cases, but while Miranda has
certainly freed some criminals _ every civil-liberty protection
does, beginning with the right to a jury trial _ the fact that
prison populations are setting record highs just about annually has
proven the fear groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Police have long since accommodated to the rule. Indeed, it
forced an up-grade in police skills. And prosecutors, thanks to
Miranda, are able to win convictions that are more resistant to
appellate reversal.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Miranda is being pushed for purely ideological
reasons, simply because conservatives hate it; always have, always
will.
</P>
<P>
   Reactionary Justice Antonin Scalia all but invited the challenge
in comments from the bench, and conservative legal activists found
a happy home for their test case in the Virginia-based,
arch-conservative 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which bought the
argument that Miranda never really had constitutional standing and
amounted only to a court-ordered rule of evidence, reversible, as
constitutional rulings are not, by congressional act.
</P>
<P>
   This conservative sport is at the potential real-world expense
of one of the crucial elements of fairness in a criminal justice
system whose fairness is spotty even when the system is on its best
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to remember now, thanks precisely to Miranda,
the degree to which courtrooms in the past were busy with suspects
whose confessions were the product of stationhouse abuses, forced
by everything from rubber hoses to harassment, intimidation and the
denial of legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The disproportionate victims of that brutish system were, as
always in such matters, the poor, the ill-educated, the dim and the
rootless. There was another victim, too: the criminal justice
system itself. The broad public respect any legal system must have
to be fully effective was undermined by abuses Miranda largely
ended.
</P>
<P>
   How queer that a return to those practices is somehow deemed
``conservative.''

 &HT;    SOUTHERN BLACK VOTE KEY TO A GORE VICTORY
 &HT;    880&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Vice President Al Gore wins the Democratic
presidential nomination, it will be because of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Should he stumble in the early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire,
``Al Gore has looked at the primary calendar and has calculated,
clearly, that the South is where he either wins or stops a rout,''
said Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University in Texas
and co-author of ``The Vital South: How Presidents Are Elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile outlines the primary
strategy against former Sen. Bill Bradley this way: ``Win Iowa, do
very, very well in New Hampshire, make him defend his base in the
East and force Bradley to come South, where we take him on and beat
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gore rarely lets a week pass without tending to
his Southern political base _ especially African Americans, who
make up 40 percent of the Southern Democratic primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, for example, Gore will be meeting with black voters
at the Auburn Avenue offices of Atlanta Life Insurance Co., the
largest African-American-controlled stockholder-owned life
insurance firm.
</P>
<P>
   At that event, Gore is expected to renew criticism that
Bradley's health care proposals could deplete the federal surplus
and jeopardize ``progressive priorities'' that are important to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   From Atlanta, the vice president flies to Orlando to address the
Florida State Democratic Convention. Florida is one of the Southern
states where Bradley strategists believe they can make inroads, and
Bradley is set to speak to the Florida convention before Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the vice president has some advantages in the
South, but we are organizing,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is likely to be intense, because whoever wins
the South is likely to win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most media attention is on the leadoff contests, in Iowa on
Jan. 24 and New Hampshire on Feb. 1. But after those states come
two ``Super Tuesday'' contests in March that could determine the
nomination winner.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these contests, on March 7, is virtually a national
primary with 14 states casting ballots, including the two largest,
California and New York. Also voting that day is Georgia, which
could provide the first indication of how the South is leaning.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later comes South Carolina, another Southern state
where Bradley strategists see possibilities of cracking Gore's
Southern strategy. Gov. Jim Hodges and Charleston Mayor Joseph
Riley, two of the state's most prominent Democrats, are neutral.
</P>
<P>
   And March 14 is the second ``Super Tuesday'' _ a Dixie fest that
features Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee,
Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   By the second Tuesday in March, about 70 percent of the
Democratic Party's convention delegates will have been allocated
between the two candidates. And more than one out of four delegates
to that point will be from the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strength in the South is ``formidable'' in the Democratic
primary, said Merle Black, an Emory University professor and
co-author of ``The Vital South'' with his brother. The largely
white Democratic Party establishment ``knows him well,'' Black
added, and a majority of party officeholders have endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Though polls show he is the overwhelming favorite of black
voters, Gore is not taking the African American vote for granted.
His courtship of blacks has been surprisingly intense, in fact,
given the popularity of President Clinton among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore started out his campaign declaring a ``personal
connection'' to the civil rights struggle led by the late Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Last month, in the same Memphis pulpit from
which King prophesied his own death in 1968, Gore characterized his
presidential campaign as a force for good ``against evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the vice president is drawing criticism for such
rhetoric. His critics say he often tries to smear political
adversaries as racists.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has been a leader of the race-baiting pack'' in the
Democratic Party, Stuart Taylor Jr., editor of the National
Journal, wrote in the influential political magazine this week.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was incensed by Gore's often graphic descriptions of hate
crimes in his speeches and by Gore's failure to admonish two senior
campaign advisers for recent comments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Brazile, an African American, who vowed in a Washington Post
interview to defeat the ``white boys'' in the 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feminist author Naomi Wolf, who claimed last month on ABC's
``This Week'' that ``George (W.) Bush's advisers'' have ``racist''
views.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has long been popular with African Americans, largely
the result of his passion for improving race relations, born of his
long and successful career in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Sunday, in a sermon to a black church in Iowa, he
promised an administration that would ``set a tone in the air''
promoting racial unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, too, as a senator and congressman from Tennessee, has
a solid record of support for civil rights initiatives. ``Al Gore
has a history of being there,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a
civil rights pioneer and Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988,
however, Gore ran as the great hope of white conservative Southern
Democrats after the disastrous defeat of Walter Mondale in the 1984
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Democrats engineered the Southern-dominated ``Super
Tuesday'' Democratic primary in 1988 in an effort to wrest control
of the national party from liberals and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore fell far short of expectations in 1988, winning just
under 26 percent of the vote and six of the 19 states in the
``Super Tuesday'' primary that year. The then-Tennessee senator was
hurt by the high turnout of black voters who lifted the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to victory in five states, also with 26 percent of the
primary vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of 'Super Tuesday's' black vote became obvious
in 1988,'' said former Republican National Committee strategist
John Pitney, now a political science professor at Claremont McKenna
College in California. ``The big loser that night was none other
than Al Gore. He learned.''

   WASHINGTON _ We are about to find out what happens when a smart

   The brainy fellow engaged with the legal fate of Microsoft's

Court of Appeals during the Reagan era and who has been cited by
American Lawyer magazine as ``the most brilliant judge in the

to draft opinions. Posner is an exception: Aside from his
involvement with Microsoft, he juggles a formidable case load and
writes all his own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Posner has also written 30 books; the most recent deals with the
impeachment of President Clinton. They include separate
path-breaking classic studies on the links between law and
economics and the links between law and literature. Each year,
dozens of articles, monographs and reviews emerge from his busy
word processor.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Posner has taught at the University of Chicago Law
School since 1969 and continues to do so, although not full time.
Along the way, he's earned a fortune by founding a successful legal
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   While Posner yaks it up with prosecutors and Microsoft's
attorneys at Chicago's Standard Club _ the same venue where
Attorney General Janet Reno once said: ``I don't like greedy,
indifferent lawyers'' _ you could ask, if Posner has done all that,
why hasn't he also been named to the Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that there's a controversial side to Posner that
goes beyond his vaunted ability to translate Sophocles from the
original Greek when analyzing the history of legal theory in
jurisprudential drama.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Posner is the highest-ranking judge to publicly
advocate marijuana legalization as a way of reducing crime. For
another, Posner holds that newborn babies should be bought and sold
on the free market as a superior alternative to
government-regulated adoption. It could be that such views wouldn't
endear him to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Less known is Posner's onetime role as a young lawyer on
President Johnson's Task Force on Communications Policy. He wrote a
draft chapter of the final report that advocated spinning off
Western Electric, then the manufacturing arm of the Bell System
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   When LBJ learned off it, he hit the roof, causing the pioneering
project to receive a fatal blow. All that happened well before
Gates wrote his first litigious e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Consider too the matter of the William J. Brennan Jr.
Foundation, created by some of the late jurist's former law clerks
to honor his memory. In 1962, having finished first in his class at
Yale Law School, Posner became Brennan's Supreme Court clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Tax records show that the wealthy Posner has not contributed to
the charitable foundation. On the other hand, should Posner mediate
a bargain, perhaps a grateful Gates would open his wallet.

   WASHINGTON _ We are about to find out what happens when a smart
man takes on the task of settling a big antitrust case leveled
against a company co-founded by the richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The brainy fellow engaged with the legal fate of Microsoft's
Bill Gates is Chicago's Richard Posner, who was named to the U.S.
Court of Appeals during the Reagan era and who has been cited by
American Lawyer magazine as ``the most brilliant judge in the
country.''

 &HT;    GOOD JUDGMENT PREVAILS AS Y2K ``MOMENT OF TRUTH'' APPROACHES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago at this time, journalists were
struggling with their own Y2K problem: how to tell people about the
computer software bug without sounding overly alarmist or
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   Write too many stories about Y2K stockpiling and we might start
a stampede to the grocery store. Do too few stories about the
seriousness of the programming flaw and business owners might
ignore Y2K until it was too late to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Midnight Moment of Truth nearly here, polls suggest
the media may have gotten the story about right. Awareness of the
Y2K bug is extremely high, with polls showing nine out of 10
Americans know about it. Considering that two years ago, most
people would have guessed that Y2K was a new and improved personal
lubricant jelly, that's a remarkable change.
</P>
<P>
   But while Y2K has become a household word, only a fraction of
households plan to take extreme action, such as yanking their
savings from the bank. A recent poll conducted by the Gallup
Organization found most people are planning to take only prudent
steps, such as making copies of financial records in case of
computer glitches caused by the bug after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, many ``trend watchers'' insisted Y2K
stories, along with promotions for New Year's Eve parties and
concerts, would trigger all sorts wild reactions. Some forecasters
said that by mid-December 1999, federal troops would be restraining
mobs of panicky shoppers at grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Gary North, a religious fundamentalist who started a popular
Internet site on Y2K bugs, predicted that ``months before January
1, 2000, the world's stock markets will have crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who saw New Year's Eve 1999 as the ultimate party
opportunity predicted that business owners would be shutting down
factories and offices in the week's leading up to Dec. 31 because
so many employees would be missing work to party in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But now well into December 1999, the buzz word for the month is
buzz. As in buzzzz, zzzzz, snore. Store shelves are piled high with
foods and banks operate normally.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K has stirred up a sensible concern about computer
reliability, rather than a panicky rejection of technology. And the
marketing efforts to spur lavish spending on New Year's Eve parties
seem to have rekindled a desire to stay home with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the mellow millennium approaches, consumer confidence is
rising, the stock market is soaring and computers are continuing to
boost our affluence.
</P>
<P>
   The trend watchers tried hard to figure out where we would be
heading at the end of the century. But there was one mega-trend
coming that no one saw: a widespread outbreak of good judgment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Conservative challenge to Miranda threatens to
restore brutish legal system
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has, dangerously, decided to revisit the
historic 1966 Miranda ruling. Dangerously, because it will be a
close call in the current conservative court whether this
fundamental protection against coerced confessions can survive.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda requires police to tell criminal suspects they may
refuse to answer investigators' questions and may have a lawyer
present when they are interrogated _ the familiar ``You have a
right to remain silent...'' liturgy of crime shows.
</P>
<P>
   The court established the rule to reduce the then-constant legal
wrangling over whether this confession or that was truly voluntary
or whether it had been beaten or scammed out of a suspect in
violation of the Constitution's protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   This late challenge to Miranda is based on a law Congress
enacted two years after the ruling, quashing the requirement. No
administration of either party has enforced the law, judging it
plainly unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had been panicked by police and prosecutors predicting
a general collapse of criminal cases, but while Miranda has
certainly freed some criminals _ every civil-liberty protection
does, beginning with the right to a jury trial _ the fact that
prison populations are setting record highs just about annually has
proven the fear groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Police have long since accommodated to the rule. Indeed, it
forced an up-grade in police skills. And prosecutors, thanks to
Miranda, are able to win convictions that are more resistant to
appellate reversal.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Miranda is being pushed for purely ideological
reasons, simply because conservatives hate it; always have, always
will.
</P>
<P>
   Reactionary Justice Antonin Scalia all but invited the challenge
in comments from the bench, and conservative legal activists found
a happy home for their test case in the Virginia-based,
arch-conservative 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which bought the
argument that Miranda never really had constitutional standing and
amounted only to a court-ordered rule of evidence, reversible, as
constitutional rulings are not, by congressional act.
</P>
<P>
   This conservative sport is at the potential real-world expense
of one of the crucial elements of fairness in a criminal justice
system whose fairness is spotty even when the system is on its best
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to remember now, thanks precisely to Miranda,
the degree to which courtrooms in the past were busy with suspects
whose confessions were the product of stationhouse abuses, forced
by everything from rubber hoses to harassment, intimidation and the
denial of legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The disproportionate victims of that brutish system were, as
always in such matters, the poor, the ill-educated, the dim and the
rootless. There was another victim, too: the criminal justice
system itself. The broad public respect any legal system must have
to be fully effective was undermined by abuses Miranda largely
ended.
</P>
<P>
   How queer that a return to those practices is somehow deemed
``conservative.''

 &HT;    Gunning for the governor's job
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Back in Texas' one-party Democratic days, and
even since, large ambitions have collided in primary elections. In
1982, for example, Attorney General Mark White, Railroad
Commissioner Buddy Temple and Land Commissioner Bob Armstrong all
ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   As Republican fortunes have risen, the competition for
nominations has grown. In 1998, for instance, the candidates for
the Republican nomination for attorney general included Supreme
Court Justice John Cornyn, Railroad Commissioner Barry Williamson
and Republican State Chairman Tom Pauken.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, the GOP ambition collision could be for governor _
between U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, up for re-election to the
Senate next year, and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry. That's particularly true
if Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who calls his current job ``the best
in the world,'' doesn't win the presidency next year.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 49, is already raising a bankroll _ the size of which he
won't reveal before he has to _ toward running for governor in
2002, regardless of Bush's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins, Perry moves up to governor, and he thinks
Hutchison would defer to him. ``Senator Hutchison has been rather
clear in her expressions of support for me and our friendship,''
Perry said recently. ``And also, if there is an incumbent governor
there, she would not consider running.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Perry cites a report of an August interview Hutchison had with
The Dallas Morning News editorial board as an indication of her
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she sounds reluctant to run if Perry is governor. But
Hutchison, 56,certainly doesn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she told the News she'd rather be governor than
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you said to me, `You can _ in an open field with no other
issues _ run for governor or run for senator,' I'd rather be
governor,'' said Hutchison, who like Perry served in the Texas
House of Representatives and held another statewide office. Friends
say she's tired of the partisan rancor in Washington and would
rather spend more time in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Texas. I love working with people who love Texas, and
it's my area. ... But it's not an open field, and it's not a
decision that would be made in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before she'll file again for the Senate seat she's
held since 1993, and with $6 million plus already banked for that
race, Hutchison would sound overly ambitious if she said she's
eyeing the governorship. But some Republicans think she could win a
GOP primary, even against Perry. Meanwhile, the Democrats are still
scratching their heads about who to run against her for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison, whose name identification will soar after
spending millions on TV ads next year, doesn't rule out a run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to close the door, but it's not something I'm
looking at,'' Hutchison said last August. ``And it's not a probable
at all. ... I'm not saying I'm not going to do anything, but
probably I will serve out my term if I'm re-elected, and that'll be
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the question was asked a few days ago, Hutchison press aide
Lisette McSoud Donnello came back with essentially the same story:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, she cannot foresee a circumstance in which she
would challenge a Republican incumbent governor. Other than that,
she's not looking at a race for governor, but she's not closing
doors or options beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her long-term future options are open, but she is focused on
doing a good job in the Senate. She's not looking to change that
course at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   A year is a lifetime in politics. We'll see what a difference
two years makes.

 &HT;    Imagine, government deciding which religion suits it
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ As much as Washington types exalt the framers of
the Constitution, the last thing most of them want to do is take
the founders' words literally.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Congress would abolish the office of House chaplain
and state a firm commitment to keep government out of religion.
</P>
<P>
   There's a better chance that porcupines will fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than heed the origins of religious freedom, policy makers
much prefer to pander to sectarian majorities to demonstrate their
godliness.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they couldn't bear to part with the office of House
chaplain, staffed by you and me at $277,000 a year. It is our
investment so that if ever lawmakers lose their religion, they can
find it down the hall and around the corner past the men's room.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating concept. We can privatize everything from welfare to
satellite repair. But when it comes to religion, Capitol Hill can't
leave the service to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 175 years ago James Madison, acclaimed as father of the
Constitution, told Congress that having a paid, on-site chaplain
was ridiculous. Not only was it foolish for government to provide
for Congress what it could find at the church down the block, but
naming a chaplain from any sect would exclude the others, an
official pronouncement sounding suspiciously like state-established
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The majority would choose a Protestant, of course. The minority
could sulk.
</P>
<P>
   Those warnings have a particular ring these days in light of
recent complaints by a front-runner for chaplain who was passed
over, he believes, because he is Catholic
</P>
<P>
   Madison had warned way back when that Catholics and other
non-Protestants had virtually no chance of serving in such a
capacity. Since then, only two Catholics have been House chaplain.
No Jews. No Hindus. No Muslims. No Buddhists. No surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of of faith and favoritism raises itself, or should,
every time government decides to walk on hallowed waters.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a group of Texas religious leaders had this advice on
government and religion merging to provide social services: Hold
your hip waders.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have
voiced support for increasing the role of churches in carrying out
state and federal social services.
</P>
<P>
   This drew words of warning recently from the 400-member Texas
Faith Network, including pastors, rabbis and clerics of other
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   It criticized the reliance on faith-based groups to deliver
social services on two grounds: First is the notion that government
could somehow ``pass the buck'' to churches and elude its
responsibility to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the guaranteed favoritism that would be exercised when
government chose religions to carry out these services.
</P>
<P>
   Bible-loving Christians? Step right up. Catholics? Just go light
the holy water. Black Muslims? Check back with us. Krishnas? Uh,
we'll call you. Heaven's Gate? The number you have reached has been
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   These proposals presume that government can determine which
religious group is suitable for its endorsement, eligible for
bidding, and which isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush, Texas has stuck a toe into this realm with a
smattering of ``partnerships'' with religious organizations such as
prison ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush makes such partnerships a common theme on the presidential
stump.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Peter Berg of the Texas Faith Network warned that under
any such programs, ``minority religions inevitably would lose
out,'' resulting in a defacto subsidy of Brand X faith, which is
state establishment of religion.
</P>
<P>
   James Madison is not amused. But by now he should be accustomed
to being ignored.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Picking up their marbles
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Greeks want to pick up their marbles and go home. These
marbles are the famed Elgin ones on display in London since the 7th
Earl of Elgin picked them up at bargain Acropolis prices a couple
of hundred years ago. The deal amounted, more or less, to theft.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Elgin, British ambassador in those parts, was an admirer of
Greek antiquities. He visited the Parthenon, liked what he saw and
decided to take the best of it home. He offered the Turkish
governor a pittance and a tidy sum on the side for his trouble. The
governor, who didn't think much of the stuff, was pleased to agree.
Ergo, the ``Elgin'' Marbles!
</P>
<P>
   The phlegmatic British weren't thrilled at first, but have since
defended their ownership with high Victorian dudgeon. They've been
claiming that the marbles are in better shape than they might have
been had the Greeks kept them, an argument a petty thief couldn't
get away with. Wrong, said the Greeks recently, you messed them up
in the 1930s ``restoring'' them.
</P>
<P>
   For Pete's sake, give them back already.

 &HT;    Earlier hurricanes predicted next year
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Next year's hurricane season may produce
fewer storms but may start earlier, a leading forecaster said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In their annual forecast, released Wednesday, Professor William
Gray and his team at Colorado State University predicted a
``moderate'' season in 2000. They predict 11 storms will reach at
least tropical storm status and gain names, with seven becoming
hurricanes and three becoming major hurricanes with sustained winds
of at least 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gray predicted 14 named storms, nine hurricanes and
four major hurricanes; there were 12 named storms, eight hurricanes
and five major hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Gray never predicts whether or where storms will strike land.
But he did say the Atlantic Coast has a 45 percent chance of being
hit by one or more major storms next year.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast calls for fewer storms than occurred in 1995, 1996,
1998 and 1999. But the years 1995 through 1999 marked the most
active five-year stretch on record in the Atlantic, with 65 named
storms, 41 hurricanes and 20 major hurricanes. And 1999 was the
first season on record to produce five major hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, a professor of atmospheric sciences who has issued the
forecasts for 16 years, also predicted the 2000 hurricane season
will start earlier. This year, Arlene, the first named storm,
developed in June, but the next storm didn't show up until
mid-August, when four hurricanes formed.
</P>
<P>
   The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, reaching its height in
early September.

   TRAVEL-FREEPORT _ FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Late-season Hurricane
Lenny churned in the Caribbean, forcing two huge cruise ships to
dock in Freeport. Passengers groaned about the unexpected change in
course to a backwater port no one knew anything about. But once on
land, they were far from irate. They roamed the duty-free shops of
the International Bazaar and Lucayan Market, found their own
private spots on more than 120 miles of white sand beaches, and
gambled at the Moroccan-style Princess Resort. But the biggest
surprise was the high style of the new Lucayan Reef Village Hotel.
These day guests were awed by the wild shapes of the
Alice-in-Wonderland furniture _ sofas with backs high enough to
accommodate Shaquille O'Neal, club chairs sporting exaggerated
curves and wind-surfer sails attached to the ceiling _ and a
two-story restaurant with chairs and wall paintings in colliding
tropical colors. (Palm Beach Post). 40. MOVED. WITH

TRAVEL-FREEPORT. Of course you could do your holiday shopping at a

prices and, under the harsh glare offlorescent fluorescent lights,
browsing the same American merchandise in store after store. Or ...
You could go to Freeport. There, fresh from a walk on the beach and
wearing a sarong over your swimsuit, you could roam the
flower-lined lanes of the International Bazaar and Port Lucaya;
shop in more than 150 duty-free boutiques; and find European, Asian
and South American gifts that might be scarce in your local
shopping center. From Bahamian hand-blown glass figurines to
Italian perfume, Lenox fine china, aged alcohol, Cuban cigars and
Gucci and Fendi leather bags, you'll find it here. (Palm Beach
Post). 35. MOVED. TRAVEL-SEAJET _ FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Last month, I
flew over to the Bahamas. But without the airplane. I took the
SeaJet Kara, a 250-passenger Boeing JetFoil, one of only two
operating in U.S. waters. The SeaJet, a hydrofoil, flew from West
Palm Beach to Freeport going 50 mph and riding 14 to 16 feet above
the water. Palm Beach Post). 25. MOVED.

Bermuda: Twenty-one miles of scenic right-of-way is all that's left

earning the dubious distinction of being the most expensive
railway, per mile, ever built. My wife and I walked the 1.75-mile
section of what's now known as the Railway Trail, one of Bermuda's

   BOOKS-GREED _ When director Erich von Stroheim was a newly
arrived immigrant to America, one of the first books he read was
Frank Norris' fascinating 1899 novel McTeague. It's the story of an
amiable lug from Placer County, Calif., who becomes a dentist in
turn-of-the-century San Francisco, then begins a long, slow slide
into lethargy and degradation that culminates in him murdering his
miserly wife and dying a hunted fugitive in Death Valley. OK, so
it's not a laugh riot. But it is a virtuoso piece of naturalism, a
shock to the system of the then-prevalent Victorian style, and a
book that can still be read with pleasure. (Palm Beach Post).

   BOOKS-VIDAL _ ``I don't like talking about myself,'' Gore Vidal
told his official biographer when their partnership began. ``And
certainly not about private matters. So I don't know how you're
going to do this because there isn't anything there.'' For his
part, Fred Kaplan preferred his subjects dead. But the academic
author of well-received biographies of Thomas Carlyle, Charles
Dickens and Henry James trudged dutifully on, and now we have
everything that isn't there in this 796-page _ not counting the
index _ biography. Gathering things that aren't there is no easy
task _ ask Edmund Morris about Ronald Reagan _ and Kaplan has done
as fine a job as anyone could fairly do, and with a good deal more
intellectual integrity than Morris. But in the end, Kaplan doesn't
fail his subject so much as his subject fails him. At 75, Gore
Vidal is a senior member of that increasingly endangered species,
the professional literary man. Beginning in 1946 with Williwaw, a
short novel based on his World War II service in the Aleutians, he
has done a bit of everything in the writing field, and not without
spirit. (Palm Beach Post). 35. MOVED.

   BASEBALL-STORIES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even for a

compelling when it's presented in Odom's own neat handwriting, with
``Oakland A's 13'' written beneath his signature and a business
card thrown in from Blue Moon Painting Service that notes the
proprietor is a ``Former Pitcher/Oakland A's.'' He is calling
attention to his past glory. Yet, in doing so, we do not see
another preening athletic ego but an ordinary man taking deserved
pride in the extraordinary moments of his past. That's often the
effect in Seth Swirsky's second disarmingly simple volume of
baseball correspondence, ``Every Pitcher Tells A Story.'' (Bennett,

   TRAVEL-FREEPORT _ FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Late-season Hurricane
Lenny churned in the Caribbean, forcing two huge cruise ships to
dock in Freeport. Passengers groaned about the unexpected change in
course to a backwater port no one knew anything about. But once on
land, they were far from irate. They roamed the duty-free shops of
the International Bazaar and Lucayan Market, found their own
private spots on more than 120 miles of white sand beaches, and
gambled at the Moroccan-style Princess Resort. But the biggest
surprise was the high style of the new Lucayan Reef Village Hotel.
These day guests were awed by the wild shapes of the
Alice-in-Wonderland furniture _ sofas with backs high enough to
accommodate Shaquille O'Neal, club chairs sporting exaggerated
curves and wind-surfer sails attached to the ceiling _ and a
two-story restaurant with chairs and wall paintings in colliding
tropical colors. (Palm Beach Post). 40. MOVED. WITH

   TRAVEL-FREESHOP _ FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Sidebar to
TRAVEL-FREEPORT. Of course you could do your holiday shopping at a
suburban mall, pushing your way through the crowds, paying the high
prices and, under the harsh glare offlorescent fluorescent lights,
browsing the same American merchandise in store after store. Or ...
You could go to Freeport. There, fresh from a walk on the beach and
wearing a sarong over your swimsuit, you could roam the
flower-lined lanes of the International Bazaar and Port Lucaya;
shop in more than 150 duty-free boutiques; and find European, Asian
and South American gifts that might be scarce in your local
shopping center. From Bahamian hand-blown glass figurines to
Italian perfume, Lenox fine china, aged alcohol, Cuban cigars and
Gucci and Fendi leather bags, you'll find it here. (Palm Beach
Post). 35. MOVED. TRAVEL-SEAJET _ FREEPORT, Bahamas _ Last month, I
flew over to the Bahamas. But without the airplane. I took the
SeaJet Kara, a 250-passenger Boeing JetFoil, one of only two
operating in U.S. waters. The SeaJet, a hydrofoil, flew from West
Palm Beach to Freeport going 50 mph and riding 14 to 16 feet above
the water. Palm Beach Post). 25. MOVED.

 &HT;    A book holiday
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This year's contribution to the typical
seasonal mixture of pricey, shelf-busting art and design books is
something a little special, something, now that I think of it, a
little too special: books about the 100 Greatest Men and Women, 100
Greatest Artists, 100 Greatest Movie Stars, etc. _ of the century.
</P>
<P>
   They all make mildly interesting scanning, but they're more a
function of marketing and our culture's compulsive, insecure need
for self-definition than of anything organic. Did 1899 offer a
succession of books about the Greatest Men and Women of the 19th
Century?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the good stuff:
</P>
<P>
   ``Century'' (Phaidon) is one of the most interesting books of
the year, a massive (more than 1,000 pages) collection of
photographs, one to a page, that seem predominantly weighted toward
violence, deprivation, and other permutations of the
through-a-glass-darkly view of human existence as chosen by editor
Bruce Bernard. There are few famous photographers (the exceptions
include Mapplethorpe and Leni Riefenstahl), just a succession of
stark, often brutal photographs. A grueling but fascinating book
that comes in its own packing case, which, given its 13-pound
weight, is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``War in the Pacific: Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay'' (Oklahoma) is
a beautiful book evenly split between period pictures and modern
color shots of World War II uniforms and gear. Perfect for readers
of Stephen Ambrose or Tom Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a bent toward entertainment, ``Will Rogers: A
Photo Biography'' (Taylor) offers a good one-stop overview of the
beloved American humorist/philosopher/movie star/trick roper and
all-around good guy who once said, ``I hold only two distinctions
in the movies, being the ugliest man in 'em, and still having the
same wife I started out with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edward Hopper: The Watercolors'' (Norton) continues the surge
of attention devoted to one of the most idiomatic American artists,
who captured loneliness as well as anybody ever has. (I was
surprised to discover that Hopper painted the Libby House in
Portland, Maine, a fascinating, eccentric Victorian mansion that's
open to the public and very much worth a look.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptian Treasures'' (Abrams) draws its material exclusively
from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Except for the fact that a
three-dimensional object in the museum never looks exactly like it
does in a two dimensional photograph, this is a definitive book
about a definitive collection. The book also contains an
interesting history of the museum, as well as a breakdown of the
Dynasties and Pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   There's some inevitable overlap with ``When the Pyramids Were
Built'' (Rizzoli), but ``Pyramids'' concentrates on art of the Old
Kingdom, i.e. 2650-2150 B.C. It's actually a catalog of an exhibit
at New York's Metropolitan Museum that I'm sorry I missed. The book
offers more proof that Egyptian art of the Pharaohs remains
unsurpassed for formal beauty and craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   George Rodrigue's ``Blue Dog'' paintings are strangely
compelling. ``Blue Dog Man'' (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang) is a sort of
autobiography and offers a wide selection of Rodrigue's noncanine
paintings, as well as dozens of the Blue Dog _ actually, his dog
Tiffany _ in various permutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris 360'' (Random House) continues the series by
photographer Attilio Boccazzi-Varotto of panoramic exterior photos
of a given spectacular city. Viewed strictly as photography, the
photos are nothing but calendar art, but their scope makes them
valuable. And it is Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, ``The First Time I Saw Paris'' (Times) is a
collection by photographer Peter Miller that stems from the '50s,
when he first arrived in town to assist photographer Yousuf Karsh.
Writer Stanley Karnow insists that the '50s were the last great
time in the last great city, but the truth is that the best times
in Paris are whenever you're young. The photos, all black and
white, are highly evocative. And Miller's account of his loss of
virginity is delightful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Crowd Goes Wild'' (Sourcebooks) is a collection of the
most celebrated sports events ever broadcast. The book comes with
two CDs (narrated by Bob Costas) in which the actual broadcasts can
be juxtaposed with the stills and analyses in the book. Hank Aaron
contributes a forward in which he says that Vin Scully is the
greatest announcer going. Smart man.
</P>
<P>
   Ever notice how much Rosie O'Donnell looks like Lou Costello?
That's just one of the random observations that occurred to me as I
leafed through Annie Leibovitz's ``Women'' (Random House).
Leibovitz often strains for effect and uses too many gimmicks _
nudity, props, costumes, white face _ but she's very good when she
keeps it simple.
</P>
<P>
   As The Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, is frankly
inaccessible for most people, a book like ``French Art Treasures at
the Hermitage'' (Abrams) can be as close as you'll get. The art
involves everybody from Rodin to Matisse _ the Hermitage has a
particularly fabulous collection of Matisse _ and the presentation
is up to Abrams' high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Two photo collections of our embattled neighbor to the south are
``Havana'' (Prestel) and ``Cuba'' (National Geographic). Hans
Engel's photographs in ``Havana'' seem to have the edge for me
because of their consistent sense of desolation and absence of
humanity, the better to concentrate on the architecture. Both books
are richly evocative of that beautiful country and its charming,
vivacious people.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the most beautiful of the gift books of 1999 is ``Van
Gogh in Provence and Auvers'' (Hugh Lauter Levin). The paintings of
the artist's later period are, of course, familiar, and part of the
world's consciousness, but they have never been more luxuriously
packaged.

</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's / www.bloomingdales.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, bridal, kids and teens, toys, cosmetics and
fragrances, accessories, home, gifts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the quintessential New York department stores. While each
click brings up a selection of merchandise, the selection seems
limited. If you know what you're looking for, use the Search
function.
</P>
<P>
   Burdines / www.burdinesflorida.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing for men and women, fragrances, gifts, skin protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Florida store'' specializes in warm-weather offerings.
Somewhat limited selection, and screens take awhile to load fully.
</P>
<P>
   Harrods / www.harrods.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, food, toys
</P>
<P>
   A modest selection of items with the logo of the British
department store. Worth noting: the coffee, tea, biscuits (cookies)
and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   JCPenney / www.jcpenney.com
</P>
<P>
   Men, women, children, toys, home &AMP; leisure, jewelry, gifts,
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive listings and easy to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart / www.kmart.com
</P>
<P>
   Baby, Books and software, housewares, health and beauty,
jewelry, lawn and garden, music and video, seasonal, sporting
goods, toys and hobbies. (Home and apparel ''coming soon'').
</P>
<P>
   Extensive listings, but not as shopper-friendly as some sites _
you have to do a lot of clicking before you can see a product
photo.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's / www.macys.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, jewelry, cosmetics and fragrances, accessories,
housewares and appliances, gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by departments and specialty shops. Each click brings
up photos and prices for up to 9 items.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Field's / www.marshallfields.com
</P>
<P>
   Collectibles, crystal, jewelry, ornaments, stationery, gifts for
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago department store. Limited selection, but some nice
items.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus /www.neimanmarcus.com
</P>
<P>
   Men, women, children, home
</P>
<P>
   The site upholds the store's exclusive image with samplings of
carefully chosen merchandise. But organizing all products under
four groupings is a little odd _ An Apple I-Book, for example, is
found under Men.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom / www2.nordstrom.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, shoes, gifts, sales
</P>
<P>
   Power Browse lets you stroll quickly through lists of products
to find exactly what you want. Each item of apparel offers notes on
fit, fabric and unique characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Sears / www.sears.com
</P>
<P>
   Appliances, parts, tools
</P>
<P>
   The softer side of Sears isn't online yet, but two areas it
excels in _ major appliances and tools _ are extensively
represented. And if you need a replacement part for a household
item _ and know the item's model number _ you can order it online.
The Tool Territory site has plans for many do-it-yourself projects
and a Tool Answer Man site for frequently asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   Target / www.target.com
</P>
<P>
   Baby, bath, bedroom, dining, gifts, holiday, home accessories
and furnishings, home health, home office, housewares, Michael
Graves, outdoors, toys.
</P>
<P>
   The well-known retailer's site doesn't offer apparel, but has
just about everything else in extensive, well-organized listings.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart / www.wal-mart.com
</P>
<P>
   Appliances, baby, books &AMP; calendars, computers, electronics,
floral, gifts, health and medical, holiday, music and video,
sporting goods, toys, video games
</P>
<P>
   The mass merchandiser has an extensive site, but bookmark the
home page because once you've selected a category, there's no easy
way to switch to another one.
</P>
<P>

mouth-watering: ``an exquisite chocolate that has a dense, complex

</P>
<P>
   Steaks, seafood and other meats.

French cheeses, and this site seems to offer them all.
</P>
<P>
   Godiva / www.godiva.com
</P>
<P>
   Chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian chocolatier ships orders from the United States.
Some of the prices are reasonable, and some are as rich as the

boxes and 421 pieces of everything chocolate, for $375.

 &HT;    `Bots' do comparison-shopping for you
 &HT;    By Richard Halicks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your boyfriend insists that the Pretenders' ``Learning to
Crawl'' was the best album of the 1980s, and you want to find the
CD online for him.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to www.amazon.com or www.cdnowcom. Both have it. But
try this instead: Go to www.mysimon.com, click on the music link
and follow the search instructions. A couple of clicks later, this
site gives you a list of 23 online vendors, their prices and a
``buy'' link to each site.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that ReviewStore.com has the best price ($5.73 vs.
$11.49 at Amazon); a click on ``buy'' takes you to the site and
directly to the page on ``Learning to Crawl.'' You're ready to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   You've just used a shopping bot. Bot is short for robot _ a
search program that goes looking for what you want. Most shopping
bots are free of charge and easy to use, and they can save you time
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mysimon.com is only one of dozens of bots _ www.botspot.com
links you to 59. They work in different ways, but most perform the
same essential function: Bots find retailers who sell what you want
to buy, and they enable you to comparison-shop.
</P>
<P>
   A few bot cautions:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Many bots have some kind of deal with online retailers, and
that deal may limit what you get to see. Some retailers may be
paying a given bot to list them first on the results page, or a bot
may not list retailers at all if they're not being paid to do so.
You may or may not be getting the best price or selection, but you
can solve this by checking more than one bot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bots' price lists often do not include taxes, shipping or
handling (www.jango.com and www.bottomdollar.com do), and those can
vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bots will dredge up stores you've never heard of. If a store
unknown to you has the best price, check them out: What's the
return policy? Does the store have a secure transaction server?
Does it have a toll-free customer service line? The site should
tell you all this about itself. The store's price may beat
amazon.com's, but the store itself may not even approach Amazon
when it comes to reliability and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Some good shopping bots:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.mysimon.com: Known as the bot to beat and vilified in some
quarters as being too cute. Covers millions of products at
2,000-plus stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.shopfind.com: Yahoo!'s bot is one of the few that lets you
search immediately for what you want (rather than drilling down
through various categories). And it's fast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.rusure.com: You can download its software free to your
desktop. When you push the buy button on a piece of merchandise at
any shopping site, rusure automatically goes to work in the
background, finding comparison prices at other sites and displaying
them at the top of your screen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.jango.com: Part of the Excite network. Very fast, very
businesslike interface (few or no graphics to gum up the works).
Also lists shipping/handling costs. Doesn't offer books or music.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.dealtime.com: Enables you to choose product, price range
and time frame; searches for the period you specify and notifies
you of the results (by email, pager or by free software you install
on your desktop).
</P>
<P>

listing of shopping bots.

 &HT;    Imported goods put world at your doorstep
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online shopping can literally put the world at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they call it the World Wide Web, after all. Even
though there are plenty of well-known American retailers to keep
even the most addicted shopper busy for days on end, there are also
great finds on many international shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas brands designed for U.S. consumers include Harrods, the
famous English department store (www.harrods.com). It has a special
U.S. site with prices in dollars and all items are shipped from a
U.S. mailing address. The selection is limited, but includes
everything from its signature tea sets to millennium teddy bears.
Hamley's, Britain's answer to FAO Schwarz (www.hamleys.com) has
page after page of fun toys and games. A shopping guide which helps
select toys by age, price range and other factors with surprisingly
good results. Pricing is available in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get to goods from overseas is to see if your
favorite U.S. site has an international counterpart. Amazon and
eToys both have British Web sites that offer slightly different
merchandize. Some items aren't yet available in this country, but
it's perfectly all right to purchase the British versions of things
like the ``Harry Potter'' books or other toys and games that you
won't find in American stores.
</P>
<P>
   However, while you may find a treasure trove of goods from
companies like British fabric store Liberty of London
(www.liberty-of
</P>
<P>
   -london.com), which will ship to American addresses; Roots, a
Canadian retailer, (www. roots.ca) does not. Overseas shipping is a
complicated process even for the most seasoned online retailer. So
make sure the items can be shipped to the United States before you
decide you can't live without that darling whatever-it-is.
</P>
<P>
   International sites also price goods in local currency, and
because they have to ship it across an ocean or an international
border to get it to you, it can get expensive.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid an astronomical credit card bill, make sure you have a
currency converter that will change the local currency into U.S.
dollars. J.B.'s Currency Converter (www.yi.com/home/BerensJean
</P>
<P>
   -Claude/currency.htm) offers quick conversions. Be careful to
read the site's privacy and security policies just as you would at
any site and make sure you understand the return policy. You may
find shipping and returning and item more expensive and complicated
than ordering. However, if it's something you or a loved one has
always dreamed of, it may be worth the effort.

 &HT;    Signs of the season: Americans rush to finish shoppng, but this
year they're jumping online
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's next, www.sitonsanta.com?
</P>
<P>
   That's about all that's missing during this holiday season, when
not a creature is stirring in many a house except for a mouse. A
computer mouse, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   On Amazon, on e-Bay, on Egghead and Yahoo
</P>
<P>
   On AOL, on eToys, on Excite and hullabaZoo ...
</P>
<P>
   Those are but eight of some 700,000 e-commerce sites floating
around cyberspace, ready to take holiday gift orders to the tune of
(choose one, because the experts sure can't) $6 billion, $11
billion or even as much as $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 23 percent of all Americans will shop online this
year, including, he says, President Clinton. And if you don't
believe life as we know it is about to change completely, then
consider how much we'll all miss those breathless news accounts of
the leader of the free world's last-minute dashes with the Secret
Service through a mall to buy Hillary a sweater on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The mall still may be the only place to go to experience a few
of the more classic yuletide moments _ buying an overpriced photo
of your bawling child perched on Santa's lap, for instance, or cat
fighting over discounted cashmere. But in every other way, it's
beginning to look a lot like an Internet Christmas. Present and
Future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't touch it when you buy it online,'' conceded Juanita
Kauffman of Dunwoody, Ga. ``But you don't have to gift wrap it
yourself, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Kauffman, her two adult daughters and 2-year-old
granddaughter were in Lenox Square on the Friday after
Thanksgiving, the traditional first Christmas shopping day of the
year. Basically, they were there to see Santa and, in at least one
daughter's case, do a little e-connaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the store first and check it out and then I go home
and order it online,'' explained Megan LeBlanc, who lives in
Chicago, while her sister and niece live on St. Simons Island, Ga.
``It makes shipping gifts to them all much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to be Scotch tape-challenged to be tempted.
Just be 12th on line for Starbucks coffee, sixth and idling for
valet parking, or merely thisclose to smacking some surly
salesperson upside the head and suddenly, you find yourself
desperately wanting to join the Surfer in Chief and the rest of the
e-lite.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually. There's still plenty of time till the 24th, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plans to shop online as the holiday season approaches,''
Steve Boyd, a White House spokesman, said several days after
Clinton's radio broadcast about his e-commerce intentions. ``At
this point, he hasn't done any official shopping yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's beginning to look a lot like every other
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE SALES EXPLODE
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season may well be remembered as the year online
sales, e-tailing (from retailing), e-commerce and e-shopping hit
the public consciousness big time. Here's a sampling of information
and projections for the phenomenon.

 &HT;    Suggestions to keep and worthwhileBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping online can be fun, it can be a timesaver, and it can
even save you money. But before you start your e-shopping
adventures, here are some key points to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   1. SECURITY: Most reputable Web retailers have secure ordering
forms to protect your personal information. They'll let you know
you are ordering via a secure connection. They also offer detailed
information about their security policies. If you aren't sure if a
site offers security, think twice before placing an order.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to check with your credit card companies
about security options they offer. For example, American Express
will not hold card members responsible for unauthorized charges
online. Nor are you responsible for the first $50 in unauthorized
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   2. PRIVACY POLICY: Technically, there's no law preventing any
Web site from giving out personal information about you to anyone
who asks. This includes everything from your mailing address to
your credit card number and even your shoe size. However, most
retailers are sensitive to shoppers' privacy concerns. Make sure
each site you visit has a privacy policy. Most of them do.
Companies like TrustE (www.truste.org) offer more privacy
protection tips.
</P>
<P>
   3. PRICE/ VALUE: Shopping online can save time, but not
necessarily money. Comparison shop online just as you would at the
mall. If $75 seems like too much for a sweater, shop around for the
best deal. Shopping search engines like Bottom Dollar
(www.bottomdollar.com) will help you find the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   4. DELIVERY POLICY: Most online purchases are shipped to arrive
within five to seven days. However, if you are in a hurry, you can
have things sent overnight or for a second-day arrival. If you do
want your items delivered quickly, remember, it's going to cost
you.
</P>
<P>
   5. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Most sites have automated e-mail systems
that tell you when they received your order, when they sent it and
when it is expected to arrive. Some e-tailers will send you postal
tracking numbers for your reference if there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to e-mail or call a site's customer service
department to ask questions, ask for clarifications or inquire
about an order. Make sure there's an e-mail address or at least a
phone number to call in case you have questions or concerns about
your order.
</P>
<P>
   6. RETURN POLICY: It's still possible, even in the age of
technology, to purchase a sweater in the wrong size or toys that
were never on anybody's Christmas list. Don't assume the stores at
the mall will accept returns from their online counterparts; in
many cases, they won't. KBKids.com will let you bring online
purchases back to the mall, but Barnes &AMP; Noble won't. Make sure you
know the return policy before you hit that ``submit'' key.
</P>
<P>
   7. UNDERSTAND THE ORDER PROCESS: Remember, your order isn't
final until you hit the ``submit'' key. If your Internet connection
seems slow, or nothing seems to be happening, you might be tempted
to keep hitting ``submit'' as you would the buttons on an elevator
that just won't close. Don't do it! Each time you hit submit, you
could be creating another order. One click is all usually all you
need.

 &HT;    Web sites keep it simple; attract teen shoppers onlineBy Frances
Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teens shopping online are the same as the kids you see in the
mall. They love to shop, but they hate being treated like kids.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites marketing directly to kids are struggling to hit the
right note with young consumers and their parents. They're also
developing ways for kids to shop online without asking mom or dad
for a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study of 16-22-year-olds from Forrester Research,
47 percent or 12.4 million young adults are online and have an
average of $3,000-$5,000 to spend annually. Teens are extremely
loyal to their favorite brands, but that doesn't translate into
online visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers have this notion that young adults are very
different and go after the cool stuff,'' says Forrester analyst
Ekaterina Walsh. ``So they stack their sites with unnecessary
features like chat, games and music that kids don't expect from a
retailing site.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to Pepsi and Levis as two sites that have loaded up
with lots of ``hip'' Web gimmicks to lure young shoppers, but
instead are turning them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levis has its own music channel and a petition you can sign to
protest violence in schools,'' Walsh says. ``The one thing they had
that was useful, which they pulled out, was online purchasing. You
can do all kinds of things on the Levi's site but you can't shop.
Kids don't want to see music or games on a retailing site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are making their own decision and they have been for a
long time, especially urban kids,'' says Ginger Thomson, president
of DoughNet, an online service for kids 13-18 who don't have the
credit cards typically needed for Web shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can open a bank account for their kids with
www.DoughNet.com's virtual banking partner, US Access Bank in
Louisville, Ky. Purchases made from online retailers or donations
to non-profit organizations are deducted from the account.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says young adults don't completely live up to their
rebellious images. They may not want to go shopping with mom and
dad, but they still want parental approval before they head out on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those sites has a parent section,'' Walsh says.
``They want parents as allies. The pitch is what is the alternative
to not using DoughNet? Letting kids run loose in the mall with your
credit card? That's probably their worst nightmare. Sites like
these let parents determine where the kids can shop and what they
can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps them away from pornography and extremely violent
books and videos. Another teen-oriented shopping site,
www.ICanBuy.com, has controls that allow parents to choose the
stores their children can shop at and approve each purchase before
the youngster completes the order.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson says DoughNet members use the site to shop and invest on
their own. It includes investment tools that help kids budget the
money in their account.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do want to be smarter about spending money, since they
don't have that much of it.'' (The average DoughNet member has $115
in his or her account.)
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says the best approach is not to treat teenagers like some
exotic species to be suckered into shopping, but to treat them like
adult shoppers. ``These kids are mature and pragmatic,'' she says.
``Especially the boys. They will pay extra to get something without
a hassle. They want quality for as little money as possible. They
are willing to hunt for brands and convenience. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The best model is Wal-Mart,'' Walsh says. ``It's on top of
teens' lists of brands they like and sites they visit. Yet Wal-Mart
is a clean site. You can just get in, shop and get out. All the
people trying to attract kids are doing exactly the wrong thing.
That's the irony. It's really just old wine in a new bottle.''

 &HT;    The wish list: Online shoppers hottest navigation tool for the
holidays
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wish lists and gift registries could be the hottest thing online
next to Pokemon trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll from Harris Interactive and www.amazon.com,
people shop online to avoid the crowds, the lines and the hassles
of shopping at the mall. They want to be able to shop quickly and
easily, anytime day or night, so they can spend more time with
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that did come through in the survey,'' says
Amazon.com's marketing vice president Jaleh Bisharat, ``is that
finding the right gift is the most stressful part of online
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   So Amazon and other online merchants have devised ``wish lists''
to help frazzled shoppers find the right gift.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's gift registry lets users roam every area of its site
choosing things they'd like to receive as gifts. Instead of putting
items into a shopping cart and making a purchase, they place items
on a wish list that they can annotate with comments such as ``This
is the gift I really want.'' The users also select people to be
notified by e-mail how to link to their list.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can use Amazon's gift registry, but it's most popular
with teenagers _ a group often cited by adults as the toughest to
shop for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish lists are a great idea,'' says Forrester Research analyst
Ekaterina Walsh. ``It makes sense for parents because they don't
have to figure out what their kids want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about using technology to solve real-world problems,''
says Bob Sacco, marketing vice president of SecretWish.com, a Web
site gift registry for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that are cool among teens that change
daily and parents are constantly perplexed as to what to buy
them,'' says Sacco. ``A gift registry aimed at teens helps the gift
buying process.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens who visit Secret Wish register and shop from a selected
list of online vendors. ``We've created a mall for teens so the
user experience is very easy,'' says Secret Wish president and CEO
Joachim Kim. ``We tried to present products that appeal, products
that speak specifically to teens.
</P>
<P>
   With teenagers, ``the shopping and buying actions are often
separate,'' says Melanie Alshab, president of FastFrog.com, an
Internet company that sets up shop in locals malls. Kids get
scanners to pick out items in participating stores and upload their

   ``Laziness is the mother of invention,'' says Secret Wish's Kim.
``Buyers ask kids to send a wish list because they are going
shopping that weekend,'' he says. ``I've been begging my nephew to
give me a wish list so I'll know what to get him. Wish lists are
like a virtual Santa's lap for kids who are too big to sit on
Santa's lap anymore.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet shopping is expanding so rapidly that it's impossible
to include all shopping sites. This list represents a sampling of
many of the better-known sites (and a few offbeat ones) in several
major categories of products.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping sites are listed under the single category for which
they're best known, but some sites offer products in many
categories. Check listings carefully.

<P>
   Anything and everything.
</P>
<P>

available. Items are sold by individuals and small businesses; eBay
acts as the middleman between buyers and sellers.

</P>
<P>
   Kitchen Classics / www.kitchen-classics.com
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen gadgets, appliances and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   This Phoenix retailer calls itself the Disneyland of kitchen
stores, and it's easy to see why. The site design is fairly simple,
but it tells you what you need to know about a huge number of
kitchen gadgets.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Clothing, bridal, kids and teens, toys, cosmetics and
fragrances, accessories, home, gifts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the quintessential New York department stores. While each
click brings up a selection of merchandise, the selection seems
limited. If you know what you're looking for, use the Search
function.
</P>
<P>
   Burdines / www.burdinesflorida.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing for men and women, fragrances, gifts, skin protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Florida store'' specializes in warm-weather offerings.
Somewhat limited selection, and screens take awhile to load fully.
</P>
<P>
   Harrods / www.harrods.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, food, toys
</P>
<P>
   A modest selection of items with the logo of the British
department store. Worth noting: the coffee, tea, biscuits (cookies)
and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   JCPenney / www.jcpenney.com
</P>
<P>
   Men, women, children, toys, home &AMP; leisure, jewelry, gifts,
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive listings and easy to navigate.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Baby, Books and software, housewares, health and beauty,
jewelry, lawn and garden, music and video, seasonal, sporting
goods, toys and hobbies. (Home and apparel ''coming soon'').
</P>
<P>
   Extensive listings, but not as shopper-friendly as some sites _
you have to do a lot of clicking before you can see a product
photo.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's / www.macys.com
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, jewelry, cosmetics and fragrances, accessories,
housewares and appliances, gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by departments and specialty shops. Each click brings
up photos and prices for up to 9 items.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Field's / www.marshallfields.com
</P>
<P>
   Collectibles, crystal, jewelry, ornaments, stationery, gifts for
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago department store. Limited selection, but some nice
items.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus /www.neimanmarcus.com
</P>
<P>
   Men, women, children, home
</P>
<P>
   The site upholds the store's exclusive image with samplings of
carefully chosen merchandise. But organizing all products under
four groupings is a little odd _ An Apple I-Book, for example, is
found under Men.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Clothing, shoes, gifts, sales
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Appliances, parts, tools
</P>
<P>
   The softer side of Sears isn't online yet, but two areas it
excels in _ major appliances and tools _ are extensively
represented. And if you need a replacement part for a household
item _ and know the item's model number _ you can order it online.
The Tool Territory site has plans for many do-it-yourself projects
and a Tool Answer Man site for frequently asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   Target / www.target.com
</P>
<P>
   Baby, bath, bedroom, dining, gifts, holiday, home accessories
and furnishings, home health, home office, housewares, Michael

</P>
<P>
   The well-known retailer's site doesn't offer apparel, but has
just about everything else in extensive, well-organized listings.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart / www.wal-mart.com
</P>
<P>
   Appliances, baby, books &AMP; calendars, computers, electronics,
floral, gifts, health and medical, holiday, music and video,
sporting goods, toys, video games
</P>
<P>
   The mass merchandiser has an extensive site, but bookmark the
home page because once you've selected a category, there's no easy
way to switch to another one.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Bots' do comparison-shopping for you
 &HT;    By Richard Halicks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your boyfriend insists that the Pretenders' ``Learning to
Crawl'' was the best album of the 1980s, and you want to find the
CD online for him.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to www.amazon.com or www.cdnowcom. Both have it. But
try this instead: Go to www.mysimon.com, click on the music link
and follow the search instructions. A couple of clicks later, this
site gives you a list of 23 online vendors, their prices and a
``buy'' link to each site.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that ReviewStore.com has the best price ($5.73 vs.
$11.49 at Amazon); a click on ``buy'' takes you to the site and
directly to the page on ``Learning to Crawl.'' You're ready to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   You've just used a shopping bot. Bot is short for robot _ a
search program that goes looking for what you want. Most shopping
bots are free of charge and easy to use, and they can save you time
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mysimon.com is only one of dozens of bots _ www.botspot.com
links you to 59. They work in different ways, but most perform the
same essential function: Bots find retailers who sell what you want
to buy, and they enable you to comparison-shop.
</P>
<P>
   A few bot cautions:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Many bots have some kind of deal with online retailers, and
that deal may limit what you get to see. Some retailers may be
paying a given bot to list them first on the results page, or a bot
may not list retailers at all if they're not being paid to do so.
You may or may not be getting the best price or selection, but you
can solve this by checking more than one bot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bots' price lists often do not include taxes, shipping or
handling (www.jango.com and www.bottomdollar.com do), and those can
vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bots will dredge up stores you've never heard of. If a store
unknown to you has the best price, check them out: What's the
return policy? Does the store have a secure transaction server?
Does it have a toll-free customer service line? The site should
tell you all this about itself. The store's price may beat
amazon.com's, but the store itself may not even approach Amazon
when it comes to reliability and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Some good shopping bots:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.mysimon.com: Known as the bot to beat and vilified in some
quarters as being too cute. Covers millions of products at
2,000-plus stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.shopfind.com: Yahoo!'s bot is one of the few that lets you
search immediately for what you want (rather than drilling down
through various categories). And it's fast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.rusure.com: You can download its software free to your
desktop. When you push the buy button on a piece of merchandise at
any shopping site, rusure automatically goes to work in the
background, finding comparison prices at other sites and displaying
them at the top of your screen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.jango.com: Part of the Excite network. Very fast, very
businesslike interface (few or no graphics to gum up the works).
Also lists shipping/handling costs. Doesn't offer books or music.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  www.dealtime.com: Enables you to choose product, price range
and time frame; searches for the period you specify and notifies
you of the results (by email, pager or by free software you install
on your desktop).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visit www.smartbots.com or www.botspot.com for a comprehensive
listing of shopping bots.

 &HT;    Imported goods put world at your doorstep
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online shopping can literally put the world at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they call it the World Wide Web, after all. Even
though there are plenty of well-known American retailers to keep
even the most addicted shopper busy for days on end, there are also
great finds on many international shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas brands designed for U.S. consumers include Harrods, the
famous English department store (www.harrods.com). It has a special
U.S. site with prices in dollars and all items are shipped from a
U.S. mailing address. The selection is limited, but includes
everything from its signature tea sets to millennium teddy bears.
Hamley's, Britain's answer to FAO Schwarz (www.hamleys.com) has
page after page of fun toys and games. A shopping guide which helps
select toys by age, price range and other factors with surprisingly
good results. Pricing is available in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get to goods from overseas is to see if your
favorite U.S. site has an international counterpart. Amazon and
eToys both have British Web sites that offer slightly different
merchandize. Some items aren't yet available in this country, but
it's perfectly all right to purchase the British versions of things
like the ``Harry Potter'' books or other toys and games that you
won't find in American stores.
</P>
<P>
   However, while you may find a treasure trove of goods from
companies like British fabric store Liberty of London
(www.liberty-of
</P>
<P>
   -london.com), which will ship to American addresses; Roots, a
Canadian retailer, (www. roots.ca) does not. Overseas shipping is a
complicated process even for the most seasoned online retailer. So
make sure the items can be shipped to the United States before you
decide you can't live without that darling whatever-it-is.
</P>
<P>
   International sites also price goods in local currency, and
because they have to ship it across an ocean or an international
border to get it to you, it can get expensive.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Suggestions to keep and worthwhileBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping online can be fun, it can be a timesaver, and it can
even save you money. But before you start your e-shopping
adventures, here are some key points to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   1. SECURITY: Most reputable Web retailers have secure ordering
forms to protect your personal information. They'll let you know
you are ordering via a secure connection. They also offer detailed
information about their security policies. If you aren't sure if a
site offers security, think twice before placing an order.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to check with your credit card companies
about security options they offer. For example, American Express
will not hold card members responsible for unauthorized charges
online. Nor are you responsible for the first $50 in unauthorized
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   2. PRIVACY POLICY: Technically, there's no law preventing any
Web site from giving out personal information about you to anyone
who asks. This includes everything from your mailing address to
your credit card number and even your shoe size. However, most
retailers are sensitive to shoppers' privacy concerns. Make sure
each site you visit has a privacy policy. Most of them do.
Companies like TrustE (www.truste.org) offer more privacy
protection tips.
</P>
<P>
   3. PRICE/ VALUE: Shopping online can save time, but not
necessarily money. Comparison shop online just as you would at the
mall. If $75 seems like too much for a sweater, shop around for the
best deal. Shopping search engines like Bottom Dollar
(www.bottomdollar.com) will help you find the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   4. DELIVERY POLICY: Most online purchases are shipped to arrive
within five to seven days. However, if you are in a hurry, you can
have things sent overnight or for a second-day arrival. If you do
want your items delivered quickly, remember, it's going to cost
you.
</P>
<P>
   5. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Most sites have automated e-mail systems
that tell you when they received your order, when they sent it and
when it is expected to arrive. Some e-tailers will send you postal
tracking numbers for your reference if there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to e-mail or call a site's customer service
department to ask questions, ask for clarifications or inquire
about an order. Make sure there's an e-mail address or at least a
phone number to call in case you have questions or concerns about
your order.
</P>
<P>
   6. RETURN POLICY: It's still possible, even in the age of
technology, to purchase a sweater in the wrong size or toys that
were never on anybody's Christmas list. Don't assume the stores at
the mall will accept returns from their online counterparts; in
many cases, they won't. KBKids.com will let you bring online
purchases back to the mall, but Barnes &AMP; Noble won't. Make sure you
know the return policy before you hit that ``submit'' key.
</P>
<P>
   7. UNDERSTAND THE ORDER PROCESS: Remember, your order isn't
final until you hit the ``submit'' key. If your Internet connection
seems slow, or nothing seems to be happening, you might be tempted
to keep hitting ``submit'' as you would the buttons on an elevator
that just won't close. Don't do it! Each time you hit submit, you
could be creating another order. One click is all usually all you
need.

`MISS JULIE' SUCCEEDS WITH FEROCIOUS PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Miss Julie,'' August Strindberg's 110-year-old play about
inter-class hanky-panky gone horribly awry, perfectly fits Mark
Twain's description of a ``classic'' as a book that everyone
praises but nobody reads. If you've read it yourself, you already
know why.
</P>
<P>
   Bleak and uncompromising, Strindberg's play ordinarily makes for
a tough 2 hours of sitting still. Neither of its two main
characters _ Miss Julie, the delusional, headstrong daughter of a
wealthy Swedish count, and Jean, the count's ruthlessly ambitious
footman with whom Miss Julie has a disastrous erotic encounter _ is
the sort of person you'd likely want for a best friend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Strindberg's script is strewn with topical
references to 19th-century Swedish politics that have lost their
rhetorical punch over the years, to put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Mike Figgis' ferociously acted, splendidly
intelligent new film version of ``Miss Julie'' triply surprising
and impressive. For my money, this intimate chamber drama, shot
entirely in Super 16mm on two roving hand-held cameras, is among
the most emotionally vital and visually sensual of all Hollywood
stage-to-screen adaptations. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the cusp of the modern age in Europe, when the rich had
electric lights and telephones but the servant classes still lived
like serfs, ``Miss Julie'' is, on one level, an upstairs-downstairs
cautionary fable about a potentially ill-fated rendezvous between
social unequals, a kind of Nietzschean, gender- and power-reversed
``Pygmalion'' by way of ``Lady Chatterley's Lover.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis, however, has rightly decided to pare away much of the
play's period political context, which is implicit in the
characters' behavior anyway. Wisely, he keeps the movie's focus
relentlessly locked on Miss Julie (Saffron Burrows), Jean (Peter
Mullan) and a secondary yet critical third character, Christine
(the excellent Marie Doyle Kennedy), who is Jean's secret lover and
the count's cook. Like some meticulous, slightly demonic chef,
Figgis raises the movie's psychological temperature by degrees,
until the actors squirm and the audience has no choice but to
immerse itself in the perverse pleasures of Strindberg's
overheated, intriguingly sadomasochistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally similar to ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' the
action of ``Miss Julie'' takes place within a single night,
virtually all of it spent in the count's cavernous kitchen, which
Figgis, cinematographer Benoit Delhomme and production designer
Michael Howells colorize with a melancholy Scandinavian palette.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Miss Julie has come to upbraid Jean for deserting
her at the servants' dance, depicted briefly as a wild, earthy
bacchanal that represents the antithesis of the tight-corseted
propriety that is Miss Julie's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   The erotically simmering mis-en-scene is established from the
moment Miss Julie bursts in on Jean, interrupts his nuzzlings with
Christine and impulsively slaps his face. While this action is
merely a prelude to the physical and psychological brutalities that
follow, it whets the audience's appetite for a compressed evening's
worth of kinky, 19th-century variations on ``truth or dare.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with gorgeous, pre-Raphaelite looks and a statuesque
physique, Burrows here proves she has the actorly goods to match
her copious physical gifts. Displaying a previously untapped
emotional depth, the actress (who had minor roles in ``Deep Blue
Sea'' and Figgis' ``One Night Stand'') brings to mind a young,
reckless Liv Ullmann in her portrayal of the slumming aristocrat
who yearns for the imagined ``freedom'' of the poor but shirks from
the nitty-gritty reality.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, Miss Julie is a pre-modern woman with
a Machiavellian streak, caught between the rock of centuries-old
sexist conditioning and the hard place of a society whose liberated
rhetoric hasn't caught up with its politics. Burrows makes Miss
Julie's dreams of escape with Jean feel as heartbreaking as they
are futile.
</P>
<P>
   Though several inches shorter and a good 10 years older than the
script implies, Mullan's calculating, intensely compacted Jean is
well-matched as Burrows' sexual adversary. This superb
Scotland-born actor, best known for his performance as a recovering
alcoholic in Ken Loach's ``My Name Is Joe,'' leaves no stone
unturned in his exploration of Jean's alternately tender and
brutal, witty and remorseless character.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the dialogue may be difficult to follow for those
unfamiliar with Strindberg's original play, particularly in the
scene in which Jean penetrates Miss Julie while disgorging his
plans to whisk her away to Switzerland and open a hotel. Needlessly
spliced into distracting split-screen images, this crucial scene _
seduction or rape? _ is fascinating to watch, but much of its sense
gets lost amid Jean's carnal gruntings.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from such rare miscues, however, ``Miss Julie'' uses film
to take us places that Strindberg's play could only hint at. Figgis
and his team have created a ``period'' film with the stinging
immediacy of a contemporary love story. &QL;

ENLIGHTENED GUARDS, RACIAL STEREOTYPES CLASH IN PRISON YARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the poster of ``The Green Mile,'' Tom Hanks looks like he's
liquefying, as if he's been greased up with 10W-40. The movie,
adapted by writer/director Frank Darabont, appears to have been
lubricated, too, to make its three-hour-plus length less painful.
(The Stephen King story that serves as the basis for ``Mile,''
serialized as six short novels a few years ago, seems to have a
layer of lard between all the lines.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' is death row (a mixture of death row being
known as ``the last mile'' and this prison's green floor, which
looks like ``faded limes.'') Hanks plays a prison guard in
``Mile,'' and the story has as unearthly a setting as the horror
stories that King is best known for.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, a kindly head death-row guard at a
Louisiana prison in the 1930s, and the distaste he and his fellow
guards have for abuse and mistreatment of prisoners seems a little
out of place. We see it when new death row inmate John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan), a hulking black man convicted for the
murder of two little white girls, is brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Simple-minded but deeply, innately good, Paul immediately
divines that Coffey doesn't belong there. It may be the only thing
that happens with any immediacy in ``Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie ``Bowfinger,'' the angry, paranoid movie star
played by Eddie Murphy rails on about the kinds of parts it takes
to get an African-American actor serious consideration: ``Black
dudes play a slave ... they get the (Oscar) nomination. White boys
play an idiot and they get the Oscar. Find me a script with a
retarded slave and then I'll get the Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   He could've been scanning the ``Mile'' script, where the John
Coffey character is a simple-minded but good-hearted black man of
the period, who calls everybody ``boss.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not inaccurate to portray black people of the
period, those from the South especially, in such a manner. But it's
a little peculiar, and insulting, to have such a depiction of a
black man while most of the prison guards _ who work ``in a
prison,'' in the South, in the 1930s _ are forward-thinkers without
a bone of racism in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   (You half expect Paul to teach the slow-witted Coffey that
reading is fundamental before the inmate has to walk the ``Green
Mile'' to the chair.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Duncan brings an enormous amount of dignity to the
role, it's embarrassing to watch a black man play what Murphy's
character would've called ``Buck the Wonder Slave.''
</P>
<P>
   The other men awaiting the walk to the electric chair in ``The
Green Mile'' act as if extra juice is already coursing through
their veins. Michael Jeter is a lovable Cajun who, if he weren't
cute enough, is given another dollop of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   In his last days, he takes to teaching an extra-bright mouse
tricks, and the little fellow, named Mr. Jingles, gets nearly as
much screen time performing his tricks as the humans do. (The mouse
could be the Shawshank Rodent.) Sam Rockwell is an evil inmate who insults through a set of teeth stained yellow with what
looks like a coat of Sears Best Latex, like a country-fried
Beetlejuice.
</P>
<P>
   The other prison guards, including Barry Pepper, David Morse and
Jeffrey DeMunn, are nondescript, good-hearted men. (With the
exception of Doug Hutchison as the weaselly, sadistic guard
Wetmore, who at least gets to show some enjoyment of his role. He
inflicts flamboyant punishment when he gets his chance to supervise
one of the executions.)
</P>
<P>
   What Darabont has done with his first two movies as a director
is created the smallest specialty in the history of pictures; he
turns Stephen King prison-based novellas into movies. (He made his
directing debut with ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' which came from
King's story ``Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.'')
</P>
<P>
   He's adept at working King's penchant for mixing genres and
nuggets from well-known movies and books in these stories. (Coffey
is part Lenny from ``Of Mice and Men,'' with a mystic gift that
makes him part Christ figure as well; just look at his initials, in
case you miss the point.) There's also a deep strain of sentimental
cruelty to heighten the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey is revealed as a childlike figure with healing hands.
(The way he takes on suffering and expunges the rot from his system
_ it explodes in a shower of what looks like deteriorating confetti
_ is particularly photogenic.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul's instinct is right: Coffey is innocent and will die for a
crime he didn't commit. (The scenes of the crime are so cranked up,
unlike the low-key tone ``Mile'' exhibits elsewhere, that they're
cringe-inducing.) And Coffey's death continues to haunt Paul today;
he narrates ``Mile'' from a retirement home. Darabont and Hanks
team for what could be called ``Frying Private Ryan,'' a
heartwarming melodrama about sacrifice, both from the man who has
to die for others' sins and the men who have to stand by and watch,
against their better instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Darabont is a skillful filmmaker who has a hard time editing
down his embarrassment of riches. As a result, ``Mile'' seems to be
pro- and anti-capital punishment. The actors are well-handled,
though Hanks is becoming so minimal in his effects that, if this
continues, he'll do his next part in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The length comes partially from Darabont's intention to show the
routine of prison life, though one of the best sequences comes when
Harry Dean Stanton joins the guards for a businesslike rehearsal of
an execution. It's ironic that the most effective scenes in ``The
Green Mileeconomical. It's also ironic that you could
probably finish reading ``Mile'' before the film is over.

 TITLE: ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War: 
 The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel''  
 Text by Richard H. Minear  (The New Press, $25)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.

   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

SPEED LIMITS IN PLACE AT RESORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not too many years ago at Killington, a speeding skier or
snowboarder might get a mild reprimand from a ski patroller. It was
a somewhat casual enforcement, patrol officials acknowledge, and
whenever the question of lifting a ticket came up, ``we'd give
skiers every benefit of the doubt,'' according to Killington
spokesman Steve Wright.
</P>
<P>
   This was pretty standard policy throughout ski country: Try to
maintain safe conditions, but also let skiers have their fun. At
the sprawling twin resorts of Vail and Beaver Creek in Colorado,
the wild west spirit of point-'em-straight-down-and-go was widely
hailed as a skier's creedo for many years.
</P>
<P>
   But times change. This year at Killington, says Wright, ``the
ski patrol has the freedom to pull someone's ticket immediately if
they see the person acting recklessly.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Vail, Killington's Western counterpart, the National Ski
Patrol has added a new safety squad called the Yellow Jackets,
dedicated to busting the fast and reckless. To date this season,
they have snatched more than 50 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for a new industry-wide campaign called Safety
Initiative 2000 or ``Heads Up'' may not have as much to do with
reality of skier safety, as public perception.
</P>
<P>
   Four agencies _ the National Ski Areas Association, Nial Ski
Patrol, Profesional Ski Instructors of America, and Snowboard
Industries _ all had a hand in creating the Heads Up campaign as a
unified effort to minimize skiing and snowboarding accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cornerstone of our safety message is that each one is
responsible for the choices (he makes) on the slopes,'' says Stacey
Gardner of the Ski Areas Association. ``Skiing is relatively
serious, and you have to be paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign has little to do with trends or fatality
records. Since the 1970s, reportable injuries on the slopes have
been cut nearly in half. Better grooming, wider trails, and better
equipment in the last 30 years of skiing's growth all are part of
the safety picture.
</P>
<P>
   Skier fatalities or catastrophic accidents have been relatively
steady at about .8 per million skier visits. In an average winter,
about 50 million skiers and boarders hit the slopes, and the
average of 34 fatal crashes has been fairly constant. Last year, 39
deaths occurred in US ski country, highest number in the last four
years, but the year before, there were only 26 skier/rider
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the big safety push came because, according to National
Ski Areas of America spokesman Michael Berry, ``we're confronting
an old addage, `perception becomes reality.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Michael Kennedy and Sonny Bono died in ski
crashes in the Rocky Mountains, the media attention focused on
skiing as never before, Berry said. ``It didn't matter what the
safety record had been up to that time. Because they were
celebrities, there was a new focus on skier safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim White, educational directorfor the National SkAreas
Association in Denver and one of the architects o Heads Up, says
the campaign is largely aimed at people unfamiliar with figures
showing skiing to be among the safer outdoor sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that people are getting the wrong message about skiing
when all they hear about in the media is the most serious
incidents,'' said White. ``Our goal is to get our message out that
the industry has a wonderful safety record.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport has always suffered from the perennial broken leg
joke. Just this year, said White, a commerical was released showing
a busload of happy skiers showing up at the lodge. The next frame
shows the bus returning ``with the skiers in neck braces, full body
casts, and dripping IV,'' White med.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is how perceptions are created for people outside the
sport,'' he said. ``The LA Times and Wall Street Journal printed
some negative (editorials), and that is what we're trying to
confront with Heads Up.''
</P>
<P>
   White, Berry, and members of the National Ski Patrol agree that
Heads Up is not a new approach as much as an intensification of
what has been ongoing safety policy at ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, they point out, most ski areas have established
``slow skiing'' zones, though enforcement has been uneven.
</P>
<P>
   White does not advocate a zero-tolerance policy that would
summarily tear the tickets off speeders. He would rather see
enforcement of the safety code on a case-by-case basis, and have
judgment become a part of the ski patroller's education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps for the first time (a skier or rider) breaks the
rules, he will get his ticket mark, then get it pulled on the
second offense. It's a case-by-case thing,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real message to people is that we are on the hill with
eyes that are watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the National Ski Areas Association does not take
a definitive position on helmets, whose popularity has soared the
past two years, a fact often attributed to the Kennedy and Bono
deaths, which were caused by head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the position that helmets are a personal choice. A
helmet is a piece of equipment just the same as the equipment on
the feet and under them,'' said White. ``They certainly are not the
whole picture. We would be concerned if people feel a helmet is the
one answer to safety.''

A ROUT LIKE THIS IS A SIGN OF HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you were an, ahem, a, um, Pete Rose kind of guy,
this was your certified Mortal Lock.
</P>
<P>
   You had the visiting team, a nice middle-of-the-road NBA entry,
coming off surprising back-to-back road victories. You know it
really isn't good enough to win three road games in a row,
especially against reasonable competition and, as a clincher, while
playing their third game in four nights.
</P>
<P>
   Then you had the home team, a nice middle-of-the-road NBA entry,
rested and well-prepped. This was a neon-lit set-up to you and me,
although not necessarily to Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to expect from young people today,'' he
said. ``I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   We do know this: In Pitino's NBA fantasy world, this bunch will
some day stroll into the Staples Center, the Delta Center, the Rose
Garden, or the Alamodome and play a game like the one they played
Wedneday night. If that ever happens, then he and his fans will
know that the Celtics have truly come all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   But you've got to start somewhere, so let the record show that
the Celtics have at least reached the point where, in their own
house, they have the power to abuse what really isn't a bad team at
all. t leads stretching as high as 36 (90-54), their wire-to-wire,
hee-hee, ho-ho, ha-ha, 115-90 demolition of the Denver Nuggets was
a pistol-whipping of the first order.
</P>
<P>
   The FleetCenter gathering of 15,730 saw the Celtics put up
season-high totals in points, field goals, steals, and assists.
Ball movement was, in fact, the key to everything. Their assist
total of 33 was the highest Celtic number in 92 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things I love to watch,'' said Pitino, ``are good passing
and good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of both encompassed in the inspired play of one
man _ Paul Pierce, wo had six of his game-high eight assists in the
first half, when the Celtics moved to a comfortable 62-41 lead.
Pierce's head was up and his eyes were scanning the floor,
searching for cutters, lurkers, and under-the-basket loiterers. The
Nuggets are not exactly known for their interior defense, and the
Celtics made them pay for their continual defensive sinning by
racking up six layups and/or dunks among their first seven baskets,
with Pierce setting the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were sending two guys at me, so I knew people were
open,'' Pierce said. ``I just dribbled out of the trap and looked
around.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made sure there wouldn't be any storybook return to his
roots story for Ron Mercer by blocking his first two shots
(jumpers, too, not layups). Mercer, who only wanted to dump on
Pitino as badly as Bob Kraft wants to be a local hero, was held to
one miserable basket in 24 forgettable minutes of (in)action.
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Dan Issel was ready for the Boston media jackals.
``We did not lose this game because of the way Ron Mercer played,''
he declard. ``That certainly was ot the case. He had plenty of
help.''
</P>
<P>
   There actually was a pretty good story lineinvolving a jilted
player. It just didn't happen to be Mercer. It was Tony Battie,
who, when he left Denver, was not exactly hailed as the second
coming of Alex English.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been playing more like a poor-man's Kevin McHale,
bounding off the bench to supply inside scoring, rebounding, and
extraordinary energy. His 15 points and 12 rebounds last evening
represented his fourth consecutive powerhouse game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a game like that when he was in Denver,'' snorted
Issel, who was a Denver broadcaster during Battie's only season as
a Nugget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me I had a game against Boston in which I almost
had a triple-double,'' replied Battie, ``so right away you know
that statement is false.''
</P>
<P>
   Score one for the jock. On Feb. 10, 1998, the 6-foot-10-inch
Battie had 10 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 blocks in a Denver triumph
over Pitino's Celtics. It was one of only 11 Denver victories
during that lost season and it surely must have been burned into
Pitino's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   So we know what Battie can do. But in order for him to become a
quasi-McHale, he'll have to kep putting up these numbers on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Pitino is cautiously optimistic. ``We think we have a
budding basketball player in Tony Battie,'' is as far as he's
willing to go at the present time.
</P>
<P>
   His mates are a bit more exuberant. ``He's been huge for us the
past three or four games,'' said Pierce. ``He's starting to realize
his potential. He's definitely working harder in practice. I can
see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie is certainly saying all the right things. Who does th
sound like? ``I'd rather come off the bench. I can study the game
and bring that excitement into the game with fresh legs and a fresh
body.'' That's what a certain Herman Munster-looking guy used to
say all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, this was an old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing, Celtic
exhibition of basketball grace and power, complete with a superb
garbage-time performance by Chauncey Billups (16 points, 3
rebounds, 3 assists in the fourth quarter alone).
</P>
<P>
   Next up: a battered Houston team missing Hakeem Olajuwon, and,
sadly, Charles Barkley. That should be another lock, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rick, we know. They're kids. No one has any idea what to
expect. And that's the gospel truth.

HOW TO USE TIMEOUT AS A TEACHING TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karyn, not quite 3, cries or covers her face when her mother
puts her in timeout. When her two minutes are up, she is
remorseful, apologetic, and anxious for Mom's hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Her 6-year-old sister is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlyn often refuses to go to the designated timeout spot on
the bottom of the stairs. When she does go, she whines the whole
time. Afterward, she stomps around, complains bitterly about the
unfairness of it, and typically repeats the behavior that put ere.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that timeout is not used often in this
house; Karyn and Kaitlyn's parents wisely recognize that their
preschooler is so sensitive, she feels shamed
</P>
<P>
   by timeout, while Kaitlyn is so strong-willed, she turns it into
a control issue. What is surprising is that psychologists and
parent educators say timeout may not belong in your house, either.
</P>
<P>
   Since it appeared decades ago as a replacement to spanking,
timeout has been embraced by millions of American families.
Unfortunately, overuse and misuse are making it less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how timeout typically works: As soon as a child
misbehaves, we remove him to a set location, usually a chair or the
stairs, and leave him for a short time, typically one minute per
year of age. The idea behind it is that separation as a consequence
of misbehavior will help him learn to modify behavior and that
there's value in taking time to regroup and regain control.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple, which is why it's popular, but it's not a
panacea. ``In certain situations, with certain children, timeout
can escalate a problem or create a new one,'' says parent educator
Linda Braun, executive director of Families First Parenting
Programs in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Timeout does work, she says, but only if it's used sparingly and
for aggressive behaviors like hitting. It does not work for
habitual misbehavior such as not cleaning up when told to or not
getting dressed on time. (For behaviors like that, praise and
positive reinforcement such as sticker charts may work better.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperament factor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperament has a lot to do with whether timeout will work. A
child who is introverted, for instance, may be able to regroup only
by having quiet time to himself in his own room, where he feels
comforted and safe. Going to her room may work for a child like
Kaitlyn, too, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong-willed, independent child has such a need to feel in
control, she turns timeout into a power struggle,'' says
psychologist Debbie Weinstock-Savoy, who leads parent workshops on
discipline for WarmLines Parent Resources in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for her isn't just being sent to her room; it's that
you say, `Calm yourself down and let me know when you feel ready to
play again.' That puts control in her hands,'' Weinstock-Savoy
says. ``Saying, `Sit here, I'll tell you when you're ready,' takes
it away. It enrages her.''
</P>
<P>
   A child with an extroverted temperament may not do well in her
room or in timeout, says internationally known parent educator and
author Jean Illsley Clarke. ``She may need to talk it out,'' she
says. ``She may need you to say, `Stand here in front of me and
tell me what's going on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Children like Karyn who take parental disapproval to heart
aren't good candidates, either. ``She internalizes so much, she
thinks she is a terrible, awful person,'' says Weinstock-Savoy.
</P>
<P>
   If timeout lowers a child's self-esteem, it may be because she
is not yet developmentally able to make the connection between
cause and effect, between her misbehavior and timeout. ``If they
aren't clear what got them into timeout, they can become overly
anxious, afraid to speak up or ask,'' says Weinstock-Savoy.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in group care, and it's a reason early
childhood educator Susanne Zimmerer discourages it at the Compass
School in Powell, Ohio, where she is the director. ``Kids end up
getting labeled by peers or labeling themselves: `I'm a kid who
gets a lot of timeout; I must be bad.' That can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For timeout to work, she says, there has to be lots of
preparation for it, because children need the misbehavior spelled
out and they need to know what to do instead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Identify the behavior
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Braun calls this the setup: ``Identify a specific behavior you
want to tackle, and talk about it at a quiet, calm time: `I notice
you and your sister play nicely most of the time, but once in a
while, you want a toy she's playing with and you grab it and then
she gets angry, and before you know it, you're hitting. Can you
think of other ways to handle that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even if parents remember to have this conversation, they often
forget the follow-up that comes after a child offers an
alternative: ``What happens if you forget to do that? What if you
do hit?'' That's crucial, says Braun, because it gives us the
opening we need: `` `If you forget, that tells me you're really
angry, you can't control your body, and you need help to calm down.
That's when I'll say, ``You need a timeout to help you calm down.''
' ''
</P>
<P>
   There also needs to be a second follow-up sometime later: ``You
were really angry this morning, weren't you? And you forgot about
not hitting, huh? That's why we did a timeout. I'm glad you went to
timeout, because you calmed yourself down. I bet next time you'll
be able to calm down without timeout.''
</P>
<P>
   This can make a big difference, says Braun: ``It feels like
you're on his side, that you're trying to be helpful, not mean and
punitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, timeout is a teaching tool for a child to learn to
self-regulate. If you're doing timeout over and over for the same
behavior, that means it isn't working. ``Try something else,'' says
Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Something else might be a variation on the theme that Clarke
calls ``time-in,'' which is the basis of her book, ``Time-In: When
Time-Out Doesn't Work'' (Parenting Press, Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   When you remove a child from the scene, sit with her, rubbing
her back or talking her down: ``It's OK to be upset. I'll wait with
you until you feel better.'' Clarke says that when a child
misbehaves, he's very upset. ``Putting him in timeout feels like
he's being abandoned,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Four A's
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because not even this will work all the time with all children,
parents also need a repertoire of other strategies. Clarke offers
The Four A's:
</P>
<P>
   --Ask. When a child clamors to do something taboo, instead of
repeating, ``That's no; stop whining, stop nagging,'' ask instead:
``What would you do if you could do that?'' By getting her wish in
fantasy, hopefully she'll think it through and decide she doesn't
want to do it; be satisfied with pretending (it really does work);
or have a response that enables you to compromise: ``You're really
tired of sitting in this restaurant, aren't you? Can you hold out a
few more minutes while I eat? Then we can go to the park across the
street while everyone else finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   --Act. Interrupting a behavior is more likely to get a child's
attention than almost anything else we do. Instead of picking the
child up or repeating the rule again _ ``I told you not to throw
indoors!'' _ matter-of-factly pick up what he threw, put it out of
reach, and say, ``Since you forgot the rule about throwing, you
can't have this toy until tomorrow.'' Clarke tells parents not to
focus on the tantrum he will now throw. ``That strokes it. Redirect
behavior instead: `This toy is finished for now. What else can we
do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Attend. This means noticing and anticipating behavior _ for
instance, that she gets whiny every day at 4 p.m. and squabbles
with her sister. Is she hungry? Tired? Overstimulated? It also
means teaching a child to attend to the results of her behavior:
``If he breaks or spills and you clean it up every time, there's no
natural consequence,'' says Clarke. ``There's a lesson to learn:
`If I spill something, I help clean it up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Amend. Children 4 and older can atone for behaviors with more
than an empty ``I'm sorry'' through clenched teeth. Ask her: ``Your
sister's feelings are hurt; she's crying. What can you do?'' This
is a time-consuming strategy, Clarke warns: ``You have to be in the
mood to be patient.'' Don't do it frequently, either; it becomes
boring and meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Separation as consequence
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ultimate timeout is not for a child but for us.
When your anger is escalating and he can see it, it's an excellent
chance to model what timeout is all about: ``I'm so upset, I'm
going to another room to have a few quiet minutes so I can calm
down. When I come back, I'll be ready to talk to you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Removing yourself when he misbehaves is such a dramatic example
of separation as consequence that it's not lost on many children:
``I don't like to play with someone who tells me to shut up, so I
can't play anymore. I can play again when you ask in a nice
voice.'' Ignore him until he speaks nicely. When he does,
acknowledge it, says Weinstock-Savoy: ``I like that voice so much
better. Now I can hear you!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Timeout may work when a child is 18 months, may not work
between 2 and 3, and then may work again when he's older. That's
because you're bumping into a normal developmental period when
autonomy asserts itself in ``you can't make me'' ways.
</P>
<P>
   _A variation on timeout is to separate siblings: ``You two can't
play with each other for the next half-hour. You each need to find
something else to do.'' You can also give timeout to a toy if play
is getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   _Timeout rarely works for children 7 or older.
</P>
<P>
   _When you first impose a timeout with a toddler and he refuses
to stay put, keep returning him, &UR;  &LR; saying, ``The timeout doesn't
start until you sit quietly.'' Offer to sit with him. If this turns
into a 45-minute battle every time you try it, however, don't keep
repeating it. He may not be a good candidate for timeout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

<P>
   In what is the start of an evolving and potentially momentous
change in America's automobile culture, car buyers this month have
a mass-market option to purchase cleaner-burning, very high
mileage, alternative automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, these vehicles _ generically called ``hybrids'' _
are not tied to range-limiting infrastructures, such as electric
recharging stations or exotic refueling centers that have yet to be
created. Instead, they rely on small gasoline engines aided by
electric motors whose batteries are constantly being recharged as
the vehicle is driven. They are refueled at gas stations just like
regular automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The two-seater Honda Insight, in dealer showrooms on the West
Coast this month and in the East in January, is just the first of
many hybrids in the works. Toyota will begin selling the Prius, a
four-person commuter car, in mid-2000. Several American
manufacturers are using hybrid technology to improve gasoline
mileage in larger sedans, SUVs, pickup trucks, and buses, believing
that more significant fuel savings can be made through changes in
the more popular larger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But for hybrids to survive, manufacturers say, Americans will
have to be convinced that the cars are not just a gimmick, that
they are easily refueled, and that they behave much like the
vehicles we drive today.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight makes a convincing demonstration. The car moved
easily in the flow of high-speed commuter lane traffic on
Interstate 93 just outside Boston on a recent week-long test drive.
When the digital speedometer read 75 miles per hour, a moving bar
graph just below the speedometer indicated the car was getting 42
miles per gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   With a move to the middle lane, a drop in speed to 67, and a
gentle but steady pressure on the gas pedal to maintain that speed,
the miles-per-gallon reading jumped to 82. A neon circle to the
right of the speedometer showed that the batteries to run its
electric motor were fully charged.
</P>
<P>
   The car, with its 10.6-gallon gasoline tank just filled, could
have continued from here into the heart of North Carolina before
needing more gasoline. A typical small sedan might get 30 miles per
gallon and on a 12-gallon tank would likely need refueling around
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight may be first to hit the mass market, but it will not
be alone for long.
</P>
<P>
   John Wallace, the director of environmental vehicles at Ford
Motor Co., recalled that during a recent visit to the International
Auto Show in Tokyo, ``You couldn't walk without tripping over a
hybrid.'' Also on display, he noted, were limited-use electric
vehicles and developmental vehicles, thought to be 10-20 years in
the future, called ``fuel cell'' autos, whose hydrogen power source
would replace gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrids represent a significant moment in the development of
automobiles, a time when technology, culture, politics, and
business mesh. They drive very much like a standard automobile, are
environmentally friendly, may render moot legislation mandating
that a certain percentage of cars sold in a state be all-electric,
and if enough Americans can be persuaded to buy them will not only
save millions of dollars in gasoline expenses but also give auto
dealers a hot new product.
</P>
<P>
   With the hybrid, unlike the battery cars in the market, there is
no need to plug into anything; and unlike natural gas-powered
vehicles there's no need to find alternative combustion fuels at
sparse pumps. Instead, drivers will pull up to the local gas
station, just like always.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never have to plug it in. It gives them not only freedom
from the plug, but also lots more freedom from the gas station,''
said Robert Bienenfeld, Honda's alternative fuel vehicle sales
manager.
</P>
<P>
   That is because of the way the hybrid's gasoline and electric
motors work in concert.
</P>
<P>
   With the Insight, the electric motor assists the gasoline engine
during a start from stop, during rapid acceleration, or on long
steep climbs. When less effort is required, its one-liter,
three-cylinder engine runs on its own. Power for the electric motor
comes from 144 D-cell-sized batteries stored in a pack at the rear
of the car.
</P>
<P>
   They are kept charged by ``regenerative braking,'' in which the
electric motor, when not assisting the gasoline engine, becomes a
generator and captures the heat and friction created when brakes
are applied or the motor holds itself back, as in decelerating or
on long downslopes. The vehicle stores this captured power as
electrical energy in the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a symbiotic circuit of power that, industry specialists
said, can be used to turn already high-mileage cars into super
high-mileage cars, or low-mileage cars, trucks, and SUVs into
better mileage vehicles. Here, the industry splits into camps, with
some manufacturers, notably the Japanese, starting small, and
others, notably American, arguing that a 20 percent savings in
gasoline in SUVs or pickup trucks would be of greater benefit than
a 50 percent savings in autos that already run clean and get high
mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Insight offers a two-seat hatchback that uses
lightweight materials _ aluminum, alloys, special plastics _ in
body and engine. It can easily average 70 miles per gallon, has a
top speed of just over 110 miles per hour and, except for a brief
pause when the electric motor whirs when starting, behaves like any
small gasoline-powered auto.
</P>
<P>
   It will be priced at around $19,000 and Honda hopes to sell
4,000 to 5,000 in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's Prius, a hybrid that seats four comfortably, will
deliver about 55 miles per gallon. It differs from the Insight in
that it sometimes runs on electric power alone _ when starting from
a stop, down gentle slopes, or at low speeds. Other times, the
electric motor boosts the power of the gasoline engine. The Prius
has been on sale in Japan since 1997 and 30,000 of them are on the
roads there. The company hopes to sell _ at around $20,000 each _
between 20,000 and 24,000 in the United States and Europe in the
first model year.
</P>
<P>
   At those prices, both companies will be losing money on each car
sold. But, they are challenging that segment of American drivers
who rail against gas-guzzlers, such as SUVs, to step up and buy an
alternative. The cars cannot be profitable if only small numbers of
them are sold, though Honda says that even if the Insight itself
does not become a big seller, its technology will likely wind up in
other Honda models within five years.
</P>
<P>
   US companies, in comparison, are moving into hybrids not only
from the other end of the auto spectrum, but also more cautiously.
They are trying to sell better mileage to a customer base that does
not seem to base purchases on fuel costs, and hoping for government
help in their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, for instance, has announced plans to build, by
2005, a hybrid version of its Durango SUV _ providing Congress
approves legislation that would give consumers as much as a $3,000
income tax write-off to subsidize the purchase of hybrid vehicles.
The Durango hybrid would be powered by a V6 engine assisted by an
electric motor. In tests, the V6 hybrid has actually proven
stronger than the standard, 5.9-liter V8 Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the hybrid concept to a vehicle such as an SUV ``is
important in this market because that's what Americans are
buying,'' said Tom Moore, vice president of the DaimlerChrysler
division for advanced technical engineering and technical affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's colleague, Scott Fosgard, echoed those sentiments: ``We
sell every V8 we can make. We can't make enough V8s.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore maintains that improving mileage on these popular, big
vehicles will be more beneficial than boosting mileage on small
cars.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment shared by other American auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, for instance, is first entering the hybrid race
with buses aimed at urban transit departments. They also have plans
for a demonstration fleet of pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace says Ford Motor Co., has production plans for a hybrid,
but would not disclose specifics. The company did recently deliver
to the Department of Energy, under a federal program aimed at
developing such vehicles, a Taurus-like five-passenger sedan that
gets 60 miles per gallon. But like DaimlerChrysler, Ford maintains
that government support will be needed in the introductory phase as
manufacturers try to convince American buyers that hybrids are a
viable alternative _ both in performance and cost.
</P>
<P>
   The latter may be the toughest hurdle the hybrids face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans haven't demonstrated much sensibility to fuel
economy,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   That is because, those in the industry say, gasoline is so cheap
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Fosgard tells of how he tries to show his German counterparts in
the newly merged German-American company why fuel economy is a
tougher sell here. He takes them to a supermarket where he shows
them gallon jugs of water for sale _ at prices higher than gasoline
at nearby stations.
</P>
<P>
   This is why DaimlerChrysler, in touting its advanced Durango,
calls it ``a hybrid vehicle that customers want'' _ an apparent dig
at companies producing smaller hybrids. And, it is why GM is
turning first to its popular pickup trucks for its hybrid
demonstration fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Honda, known as a leader in clean-running, high-mileage
automobiles, says its research shows demand for cars like the
Insight, either as primary transportation or part of a family
``fleet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like nothing better than to see somebody who has a need
for an SUV on weekends park that thing on Monday and commute to
work through Friday'' in an Insight, said Honda's Bienenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed-use approach _ both in what types of cars Americans buy
and the means to power them _ will bode well for a country whose
population and number of cars on the roads continue to increase,
according to Don Norman, manager of policy analysis and statistics
at the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Norman said that, over time, there will be ``a significant
improvement in gasoline mileage'' based on several new forms of
power. It will be good not only for consumers, he said, but for the
environment and for the gasoline industry, where more drivers
needing ever more fuel could put fierce production pressures on the
industry and drive up the cost of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's misleading to think that one technology is going to solve
all the problems,'' said Honda's Bienenfeld. ``But right now, the
gasoline infrastructure is perfect and the hybrid is certainly the
first of these advanced technologies that is mass market ready.''

   Sometimes this column can be about safe driving. Sometimes it
can be about practical cars. Sometimes it can be about esoteric
cars that most of us can only dream about ever owning. But
sometimes, especially around Christmas, it can be about what that
holiday has come to mean to so many folks: stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in sometimes specific, sometimes generic mode, is stuff it
might be fun to find in your stocking, under your tree, or in your
garage come Christmas morning.
</P>

sand (at hardware stores), a trenching tool (Army surplus stores),
wool blanket, new jumper cables, a bag stuffed with wool mittens,
wool hat, and felt-lined boots. Have them put them in their trunk
for winter journeys. It all could come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   --For the SUVer and 4x4 enthusiast for whom the snow tire is not

HOW TO USE TIMEOUT AS A TEACHING TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karyn, not quite 3, cries or covers her face when her mother
puts her in timeout. When her two minutes are up, she is
remorseful, apologetic, and anxious for Mom's hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Her 6-year-old sister is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlyn often refuses to go to the designated timeout spot on
the bottom of the stairs. When she does go, she whines the whole
time. Afterward, she stomps around, complains bitterly about the
unfairness of it, and typically repeats the behavior that put her
there.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that timeout is not used often in this
house; Karyn and Kaitlyn's parents wisely recognize that their
preschooler is so sensitive, she feels shamed
</P>
<P>
   by timeout, while Kaitlyn is so strong-willed, she turns it into
a control issue. What is surprising is that psychologists and
parent educators say timeout may not belong in your house, either.
</P>
<P>
   Since it appeared decades ago as a replacement to spanking,
timeout has been embraced by millions of American families.
Unfortunately, overuse and misuse are making it less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how timeout typically works: As soon as a child
misbehaves, we remove him to a set location, usually a chair or the
stairs, and leave him for a short time, typically one minute per
year of age. The idea behind it is that separation as a consequence
of misbehavior will help him learn to modify behavior and that
there's value in taking time to regroup and regain control.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple, which is why it's popular, but it's not a
panacea. ``In certain situations, with certain children, timeout
can escalate a problem or create a new one,'' says parent educator
Linda Braun, executive director of Families First Parenting
Programs in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Timeout does work, she says, but only if it's used sparingly and
for aggressive behaviors like hitting. It does not work for
habitual misbehavior such as not cleaning up when told to or not
getting dressed on time. (For behaviors like that, praise and
positive reinforcement such as sticker charts may work better.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperament factor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperament has a lot to do with whether timeout will work. A
child who is introverted, for instance, may be able to regroup only
by having quiet time to himself in his own room, where he feels
comforted and safe. Going to her room may work for a child like
Kaitlyn, too, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong-willed, independent child has such a need to feel in
control, she turns timeout into a power struggle,'' says
psychologist Debbie Weinstock-Savoy, who leads parent workshops on
discipline for WarmLines Parent Resources in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for her isn't just being sent to her room; it's that
you say, `Calm yourself down and let me know when you feel ready to
play again.' That puts control in her hands,'' Weinstock-Savoy
says. ``Saying, `Sit here, I'll tell you when you're ready,' takes
it away. It enrages her.''
</P>
<P>
   A child with an extroverted temperament may not do well in her
room or in timeout, says internationally known parent educator and
author Jean Illsley Clarke. ``She may need to talk it out,'' she
says. ``She may need you to say, `Stand here in front of me and
tell me what's going on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Children like Karyn who take parental disapproval to heart
aren't good candidates, either. ``She internalizes so much, she
thinks she is a terrible, awful person,'' says Weinstock-Savoy.
</P>
<P>
   If timeout lowers a child's self-esteem, it may be because she
is not yet developmentally able to make the connection between
cause and effect, between her misbehavior and timeout. ``If they
aren't clear what got them into timeout, they can become overly
anxious, afraid to speak up or ask,'' says Weinstock-Savoy.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in group care, and it's a reason early
childhood educator Susanne Zimmerer discourages it at the Compass
School in Powell, Ohio, where she is the director. ``Kids end up
getting labeled by peers or labeling themselves: `I'm a kid who
gets a lot of timeout; I must be bad.' That can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For timeout to work, she says, there has to be lots of
preparation for it, because children need the misbehavior spelled
out and they need to know what to do instead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Identify the behavior
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Braun calls this the setup: ``Identify a specific behavior you
want to tackle, and talk about it at a quiet, calm time: `I notice
you and your sister play nicely most of the time, but once in a
while, you want a toy she's playing with and you grab it and then
she gets angry, and before you know it, you're hitting. Can you
think of other ways to handle that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even if parents remember to have this conversation, they often
forget the follow-up that comes after a child offers an
alternative: ``What happens if you forget to do that? What if you
do hit?'' That's crucial, says Braun, because it gives us the
opening we need: `` `If you forget, that tells me you're really
angry, you can't control your body, and you need help to calm down.
That's when I'll say, ``You need a timeout to help you calm down.''
' ''
</P>
<P>
   There also needs to be a second follow-up sometime later: ``You
were really angry this morning, weren't you? And you forgot about
not hitting, huh? That's why we did a timeout. I'm glad you went to
timeout, because you calmed yourself down. I bet next time you'll
be able to calm down without timeout.''
</P>
<P>
   This can make a big difference, says Braun: ``It feels like
you're on his side, that you're trying to be helpful, not mean and
punitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, timeout is a teaching tool for a child to learn to
self-regulate. If you're doing timeout over and over for the same
behavior, that means it isn't working. ``Try something else,'' says
Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Something else might be a variation on the theme that Clarke
calls ``time-in,'' which is the basis of her book, ``Time-In: When
Time-Out Doesn't Work'' (Parenting Press, Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   When you remove a child from the scene, sit with her, rubbing
her back or talking her down: ``It's OK to be upset. I'll wait with
you until you feel better.'' Clarke says that when a child
misbehaves, he's very upset. ``Putting him in timeout feels like
he's being abandoned,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Four A's
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because not even this will work all the time with all children,
parents also need a repertoire of other strategies. Clarke offers
The Four A's:
</P>
<P>
   --Ask. When a child clamors to do something taboo, instead of
repeating, ``That's no; stop whining, stop nagging,'' ask instead:
``What would you do if you could do that?'' By getting her wish in
fantasy, hopefully she'll think it through and decide she doesn't
want to do it; be satisfied with pretending (it really does work);
or have a response that enables you to compromise: ``You're really
tired of sitting in this restaurant, aren't you? Can you hold out a
few more minutes while I eat? Then we can go to the park across the
street while everyone else finishes.''

`NO POPERY,' SAYS THE U.S. CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the 19th century, ``no popery'' was a popular political
slogan in the United States. Because the nation's Protestant
majority feared the power of the fast-growing Roman Catholic
minority, anti-Catholic candidates won seats in Congress by
condemning the Roman church.
 &HT;    Using political means, Protestants legally enforced
discrimination against Roman Catholics. By warning of the tyranny
of the pope and evils of the church, they often incited violence
against Catholics -- especially priests, monks, and nuns.
 &HT;    Who would have guessed that echoes of ``No Popery'' still
resound in the halls of Congress?
 &HT;    Last week, the House of Representatives chose the Rev. Charles
Parker Wright, a Presbyterian minister, as their new chaplain.
Wright was last on a list of three candidates selected by a
bipartisan committee to fill the vacancy. The first candidate, and
overwhelming choice of the selection committee, was the Rev.
Timothy J. O'Brien, a Roman Catholic priest.
 &HT;    Although the post of House chaplain was created in 1789, no
Catholic has ever served in that capacity. With the O'Brien
recommendation, Congress was set to make history.
 &HT;    Despite the committee's recommendation, however, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and House majority leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), both Protestants, chose Wright over O'Brien, citing
Wright as ``the one who would jell the best with the members (of
the House) and their families.''
 &HT;    Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) stated, ``As a member of the House
and a member of the committee and as a Catholic, I'm offended and
resentful.''
 &HT;    O'Brien remarked, ``I'm not convinced that the prejudicial view
is gone, and I do believe that if I were not a Catholic priest I
would be the House chaplain.''
 &HT;    A Roman Catholic chaplain would not pose a problem for most
Americans. The majority of Protestants live in blissful ignorance
-- or embarrassed regret -- of their ancestors' discriminatory
past. Indeed, earlier this autumn, Lutherans and Roman Catholics
issued a joint statement, a kind of theological peace treaty,
proclaiming their agreement over some of the concerns that had
divided them since the 16th century Reformation. The U.S. Congress
might have celebrated this happy ecumenical moment with O'Brien's
appointment.
 &HT;    Hastert and Armey chose not to make history. Instead, they chose
to revisit America's sad history of anti-Catholicism.
 &HT;    Hastert and Armey's primary constituency is that of conservative
evangelicals and fundamentalists associated with the religious
right. Unlike their more liberal Protestant kin, they are neither
ignorant of, nor embarrassed by, past tensions between Protestants
and Roman Catholics.
 &HT;    Theologically, conservative Protestants do not believe that
Roman Catholics are ``saved.'' Catholics, so the argument runs, are
not ``born again'' (only those ``born again'' can be assured of
heaven). Instead, Roman Catholics depend on sacraments and good
works for salvation. This, conservative evangelicals believe, is
contrary to the Bible.
 &HT;    Thus, Catholics must repent of their sins (and usually their
association with the Catholic Church) in order to avoid eternal
damnation. Catholics are prime targets for evangelistic crusades.
 &HT;    Politically, however, conservative Protestants have often found
common cause with Roman Catholics. In the last 20 years, these
traditionally hostile groups worked together opposing abortion,
divorce and homosexual rights. During the heyday of the Christian
Coalition, Ralph Reed tried to form a Catholic Alliance as an arm
of the larger organization. He recognized the political power that
unity between conservative Protestants and Catholics promised.
 &HT;    But all attempts at bridge-building failed. In this case,
politics did not triumph over theology.
 &HT;    That Hastert and Armey were unable to shake anti-Catholic
prejudice should surprise no one. Hastert attended Wheaton College,
an evangelical school with few Catholic students and no Catholic
faculty members. There, Catholic doctrine -- particularly when
Hastert was a student-- would not have been presented
sympathetically.
 &HT;    Armey, even during his interview with O'Brien, confessed, ``I
was raised in North Dakota where there's lots of Lutherans, who
always complained about Catholics.''
 &HT;    During the final interview, O'Brien complained that he ran into
an ``evangelical Protestant line of questioning,'' including being
asked his favorite Bible verses and how hard it must be to be an
unmarried priest.
 &HT;    The only surprise is how ignorant these men are -- and from that
position of ignorance they are making public policy. These are the
same people who want to reinstate prayer in school and post the Ten
Commandments in classrooms?
 &HT;    To those of us with eyes to see, the O'Brien debacle reveals the
theology behind such an innocent-seeming agenda -- they want to
make all Americans into their image of what a Christian should be.
 &HT;    God help them. They really needed a Catholic priest. A rabbi, an
imam and a Buddhist monk probably wouldn't hurt, either.

A CHANGING CITY IS UNITED BY FIRE GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ It was supposed to be part of the revival,
this giant brick warehouse half-eaten by fire.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance from the Worcester Common Outlets mall and the
shiny new medical center, the 72-year-old hulking cold storage
building would find new life as a biotechnology headquarters,
another player in this city's glossy, high-tech future.
</P>
<P>
   But many say the tragic fire that roared through the Worcester
Cold Storage and Warehouse Co., killing six firefighters, has
jolted booming Worcester back into the past, back into its
small-town, neighborly ways.
</P>
<P>
   A city with rapidly diversifying interests is connected again by
a single, tragic event.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the city was expected to come to a virtual standstill
as more than 20,000 mourners, including President Clinton and
firefighters from around the world, gather to honor the fallen men.
People are expected to line the streets to observe a solemn
processional.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the tribute takes place, the comrades of firefighters
Paul Brotherton, Jeremiah Lucey, Lt. Thomas Spencer, Joseph
McGuirk, and Timothy Jackson, 51, will continue to pick through the
still-smoldering building for their remains. And the sprawling
warehouse seems even more a relic of the past _ a piece of
Worcester's industrial history, the site of an outpouring of grief
and support that has made this city of nearly 170,000 feel much
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Where it not for the disaster, the warehouse might be a fitting
symbol for a city teetering between yesterday and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester is a city dotted with red brick warehouses, bound to
its manufacturing past, but aching to reap the economic benefit of
a modern, high-tech economy. It is a city whose residents boast
about their homespun image, but grumble about their dead downtown.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a city that is changing, as medical centers fill old
warehouses, construction sites spring up around the downtown
streets, and the suburbs swell with young families.
</P>
<P>
   Signs throughout the city announce that ``Worcester Builds''; a
pristine, refurbished train station seems especially clean and
white next to an elevated highway and rusting railroad bridges.
Construction is nearly complete to give Worcester a more direct
connection to the Massachusetts Turnpike _ something New England's
second-largest city has never had.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are aware of the transformation, and some are wary of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like living here because it's kind of low key. People are
mellow. Everybody knows each other,'' said Bill Bertel, 42, who
works at a produce market near the fire-ravaged warehouse. ``The
city's growing up, though.''
</P>
<P>
   But throughout Worcester talk of the future has come to a
temporary halt as people focus on the painful task of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you go, it's the first thing people talk about,''
said Phil Niddrie, public affairs manager for the Worcester Area
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And Worcester, a city with no major sports teams and that boasts
few recent celebrities, now has a half dozen homegrown heros to
look up to.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are eager to pay tribute to them, to participate in
the grieving. Following the advice of a local radio station, many
turn on their headlights during the day to honor the victims.
Businesses hang signs in tribute to the six fallen firefighters,
whose pictures are displayed on a giant billboard near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day and into the night, a constant stream of
people makes the pilgrimage to the sight of the deadly fire.
Parents bring small children, who carry flowers. Some stand across
the street from the warehouse, staring straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen at Worcester's Central Fire Station is overflowing
with gifts: cakes, cookies, bread, pasta, cases of soda, cards from
schoolchildren. In the station, the atmosphere is reunion-like;
current firefighters mingle with alumni and talk about days gone
by.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they talked about the men who have been lost. Amid
the packages of food is a picture of Paul Brotherton, 41, who died
in last week's blaze. He and his six sons stand in a row on a
beach, their backs to the camera. They are bronzed by the sun, and
each one has pulled down his bathing suit just far enough to show
his tan line, and maybe a little more.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters talk about Brotherton, how funny he was, how
crazy. But when a new colleague comes through the door to pay
respects, they stop laughing for a moment and hug each other, hard.
</P>
<P>
   At the station, emotions are heightened by exhaustion. There are
memorials to plan, and fires still to fight; Wednesday afternoon
the engines went screaming out toward a small one.
</P>
<P>
   And in between, they spend hours at the warehouse where the
search continues and the fire still burns. Half the building is
gone and yet the flames remain, fed by piles of debris inside. By
day, smoke dribbles out from the brick walls. By night, the windows
glow orange and hot.
</P>
<P>
   It's not nearly the enermous blaze the Rev. Joseph A. Coonan
watched from his rectory window at St. John's Church last Friday
night, but it is demoralizing nonetheless, he said. Because the
fire still burns, and spotlights flood the area with an eerie glow,
and the remains of the all six fallen firefighters have yet to be
found, Worcester is still grief-stricken, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compassion of people coming together from everywhere is
the positive part of this,'' he said. But ``people are sad. Very,
very sad...There has been a cloud over the city since Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Good can come from such sadness, Coonan said, but bad can come,
too. Because a pair of homeless people, it is alleged,
inadvertently set the fire, he fears a backlash against the other
homeless who live in vacant buildings throughout the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   And even if this fire spurs efforts to help the homeless, he
said it will come as part of a pattern that repeats itself in
Worcester: A willingness to address big problems only after tragedy
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to call it an after-the-fact city,'' he said. ``When
something terrible happens after the fact we start looking for
resolution to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Worcester may not be the only city to behave that way, Coonan
concedes but the graying long-time schoolteacher, who became a
priest 10 years ago, admits he has borne a slight grudge against
his hometown for decades. It started when city officials refused to
let the Grateful Dead play in town.
</P>
<P>
   They were fearful of ``Deadheads,'' hippies, of newness, of
change, he said, a parochialism that left him bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is another side to Worcester's parochialism that
leaves many residents glowing _ the friendly, know-your-neighbors
side that makes people reach out to each other. It's the impusle
that spurs the firefighters union to build wheelchair ramps for
free at the homes of disabled children in the city. It's the
impulse that has brought forth so many donations and gifts and warm
feelings this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing around this fire isn't really that
remarkable,'' for Worcester, said Jim Caradonio, the city's
superintendent of schools. ``The generosity and soul is just
expanding to the enormity of the tragedy.''

WARNER'S SITE IS BOTH FLASHY AND FRUSTRATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner's new Web site, Entertaindom.com, is a gigantic
digital theme park, with flashing lights, scrolling headlines, and
throbbing graphics. Ladies and gentlemen, check out the latest
Looney Tunes! Get your horoscope here! Step right up and play ``Ask
Dr. Science,'' a new Web show where you get to send queries to a
cartoon character with a big beard, a big ego, and a big mouth.
Don't be shy! Step right up!
</P>
<P>
   After a week spent playing around in this land of sensory
overload, I have a few questions for the good doctor:
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't ``Ask Dr. Science'' run when I press the start
button? Why does my browser keep crashing? Why do I keep getting
error messages? Why is this thing so slow? Why am I tempted to
throw this computer across the room?
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, is this the fun part yet?
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Warner Bros. Online, the long-awaited Web site is
the biggest effort to date by a Hollywood studio to present
entertainment content on the Internet. Certainly, Warner Bros.
deserves credit for being the first major studio to launch such an
aggressive on-line experiment _ but the key word here is
experiment. All week, the much-hyped site suffered the kind of
slowdowns and snafus that have become typical with Web debuts
(remember Victoria's Secret?).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Internet pundits have hailed the site as the
dawn of a new age in entertainment, making one wonder if they
actually looked at the content _ a collection of articles from Time
Warner publications, cartoons, animated spoofs, and clips from
``The Monkees.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. Online president Jim Moloshok acknowledges that the
site is a work in progress and that the programming will evolve,
just as it has in other media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating the first generation of the next generation of
entertainment,'' he says. ``This fits into the Warner Bros.
tradition. We were the first to go from silent movies to talkies
with `The Jazz Singer.' And when TV was coming out in the early
'50s, other studios refused to produce for television, but Warner
Bros. went out there and created a huge collection of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it really possible to compare the Internet with the
invention of talking pictures and the early days of television?
Let's just take television. In the '50s, folks flocked to
neighbors' houses to watch ``The Milton Berle Show,'' with the kind
of urgency usually reserved for national disasters or the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a phenomenon,'' says television historian Alex McNeil,
author of ``Total Television.'' ``People would watch test patterns
because it was a completely new medium. It was unprecedented to
have sound and pictures coming into your home. People thought it
was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are things about the Internet that continue to amaze
even the most jaded of users. (For starters, the research tools
alone make it so much easier to cheat on crossword puzzles.) But
does anybody really think the ability to watch Bugs Bunny on a
computer screen is awe-inspiring? Or is anyone really bowled over
by the opportunity to wait and wait to download the free software
needed to watch a short interactive Superman saga in 3-D animation?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but for today's sophisticated media hounds, this stuff
just isn't amazing _ and it isn't unprecedented. Most of the
technologies used on Entertaindom.com are available in small doses
on other Web sites. And other Internet start-ups, such as Digital
Entertainment Network and Pseudo.com, have tried (somewhat
unsuccessfully) to grab viewers with on-line entertainment. Last
year, cartoonnetwork.com launched a series of Web cartoons that is
similar to some of the fare being offered on Entertaindom.com.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to get users hooked to one or more of the features
so that they come back. The show with the most potential is ``The
God and Devil Show,'' an irreverent cartoon that features the deity
and the demon as talk show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``guest'' is aging rocker Keith Richards, a Rolling
Stone who has gathered a fair share of moss. Next week's ``guest''
is Ghandi, who looks like he's auditioning for the role of
Superman.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the irreverence, the satire is predictable and not
exactly cutting-edge comedy. The idea is a good one, but the show
cries out for better writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``God and Devil'' also has some interactive elements that are
amusing for a few minutes. At the end of each Web-isode, viewers
vote whether to send the guest to heaven or hell. The show also has
a bulletin board where users can post reactions to each episode,
which lasts just a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes almost as long to register for the boards than it
does to watch the show; it's hard to imagine anyone eager to have a
spirited on-line debate about a five-minute cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a toll-free number where callers can leave messages
for the Devil, a she-demon in a fetching red miniskirt. So here's
our message for the Devil: ``Hey, babe. Nice outfit. You and the
folks at Warner Bros. score points for trying. But when will
on-line entertainment be less about gimmicks and more about
gripping stories? And by the way, can you help us get in touch with
Dr. Science?''

A CRITIC'S CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Janet Maslin and Vincent Canby were on their way to
an early screening of ``The Godfather Part III.'' The crowd outside
the theater was filled with excitement. Maslin, who would be
reviewing the film for The New York Times, confessed to Canby that
she was, too. Her Times colleague replied, ``Actually, I'd rather
be excited on the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement on the way out might double as a description of
Maslin's life these days. In September, after nearly three decades
of reviewing movies for a living, 22 of those years at the Times,
and the last 6 as the paper's senior critic, she announced that
she'd be leaving at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Times named Elvis Mitchell, movie critic for the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and A. O. Scott, Sunday book critic for
Newsday, to succeed Maslin, thus putting to an end a minor media
tizzy that had rumors being speed-dialed from Hollywood (She's
being forced out!) to Times Square (She inherited a million
dollars!) and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting story, though, has little to do with
bold-face names in gossip columns. It's about a successful
middle-aged person who, feeling the need for a change, decided to
do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really embarrassing to be this much of a cliche,'' Maslin
says during a recent lunch at a midtown Manhattan restaurant. ``But
(this year) my father died, I turned 50, I wanted to smell the
roses. . . . It's the career equivalent of hang gliding. That's
what it is really. Most people when they do something like this
have something else in mind (for what's next). I'm just taking a
big leap.''
</P>
<P>
   What Maslin's leaping from may be the most important print
position in her profession. With television and Internet reviews
becoming an ever greater commercial force, and no one having
stepped forward in the '90s to assume the mantle of Pauline Kael
(who dominated critical discourse during her quarter-century at The
New Yorker), the institutional prominence of the Times gives its
senior critic a very high profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who writes for the Times,'' says film historian and
New York Observer critic Andrew Sarris, ``cover(s) the waterfront.
. . . They have influence in Hollywood. They have influence
overseas. It's a huge, huge responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The high profile come with a cost, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hellish job,'' Sarris says. ``You've got the whole
world jumping all over you. It's more pressure than anyone (else)
has in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Times management would seem to agree, seeing as how they hired
two critics to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, she's reviewed 160 films. Maslin estimates she
sees an annual average of 400. Last week she reviewed three and saw
nine.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising thing, perhaps, isn't that Maslin's calling it
quits. It's that she's stuck it out so long. ``To have done this
job so well over 20 years,'' marvels Los Angeles Times film critic
Kenneth Turan, a reported finalist for the job, ``and to have so
much grace in her writing and still maintain a love for film over
that period of time is a really remarkable achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Maslin has her detractors _ though the
small and incestuous nature of the reviewing business means that
none of the colleagues contacted for this article was willing to go
on the record when criticizing her. Complaints, when voiced, center
on her practicing what Sarah Kerr, writing in Slate last spring,
called ``a criticism of lowered expectations'' and/or too often
going with the critical flow. Paradoxically, she's also been chided
for flouting the critical consensus in her two most-discussed
reviews this year, which praised George Lucas's ``The Phantom
Menace'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Maslin stands by those reviews but concedes a larger point.
``I'm probably a little too generous. When I see good work in
something that isn't really successful, I can still sometimes
admire the intention or some part of it that did work. . . . I hope
I've brought some sense of my own enthusiasm and was able to light
that spark in other people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason no one's willing to go on the record criticizing
Maslin is her personality. Even detractors speak fondly of her, and
friends cannot praise her enough. It was a case in point when
Charlie Rose gave her half an hour on his PBS show last month and
paid her that rarest of Charlie Rose tributes: adoring her even
more than he was adoring himself.
</P>
<P>
   Music writer and record producer James Isaacs, who worked with
Maslin when she was starting out at The Boston Phoenix, likens her
to the wisest of Golden Age screen goddesses. ``You know who Janet
always reminded me of? Myrna Loy. She has the eyes, obviously, but
also Myrna Loy's vibe: very smart, very witty, amused as well as
amusing. You can definitely see Janet in a smart-set '30s movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see what Isaacs means. Maslin is an engaging blend
of cool wit (her eyebrow arching is world class) and gracious
bearing. When the restaurant owner comes over to announce he has a
bit part in ``The Insider,'' the Michael Mann film starring Al
Pacino, and to inquire if she's seen it, Maslin congratulates him _
then refrains from pointing out that if he'd read her review he
wouldn't have asked that question.
</P>
<P>
   Maslin was born in Manhattan and grew up on Long Island. She
began moviegoing early: Her parents would put her in pajamas and
take her to the Whitestone Drive-In, in Queens. Her father worked
in real estate, and her mother taught mathematics. Maslin took
after mom. She was the sole girl on her high school math team. She
majored in the subject at the University of Rochester, though she
took almost as many courses in English and managed to squeeze in a
film course.
</P>
<P>
   That course was far from her mind, however, after graduation, in
1970. ``The National Lampoon had just started,'' she says. ``I
thought it was funny, so I wangled myself a job there as a
secretary filling in for two weeks. Remember how they used to run
these features with Polaroid photos? I was in one, which I'd just
as well not remember now, with (writer) Doug Kenney, and had hair
down to here.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine was full of Harvard grads, who urged her to give
Cambridge a try. ``Math was really a dead end,'' she says. ``So I
went up there and got a job at Harvard, as a secretary to (Nobel
Prize winners) J. D. Watson and Walter Gilbert at the molecular
biology lab. The other secretary was a classical pianist. But we
both needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chief duty was to provide cookies for the graduate
students at teatime (Dr. Watson had spent his formative years in
England and believed in high tea), and we were not to talk because
we would distract them from their serious scientific thought. I
lasted about a month and a half doing this. But during that time,
I'd be sorting the mail and the old Boston After Dark used to come
in. It was fun to read and I just thought, `Boy, it looks like open
season there,' so that's where I went.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough she was writing about movies (and BAD had become The
Boston Phoenix). ``Everything was just wide open,'' Maslin recalls.
``You could write any old way you wanted, and we all learned by
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   They learned fast, too. Writing about film for the alternative
press in Boston during the '70s was the journalistic equivalent of
playing jazz in Kansas City during the '30s _ or shortstop in the
American League in the '90s. Talent abounded. Maslin was succeeded
at the Phoenix by The New Yorker's David Denby, who was succeeded
by Stephen Schiff, who after stints at Vanity Fair and The New
Yorker now writes screenplays. Newsweek's David Ansen was at The
Real Paper, as was David Thomson, a future Esquire film columnist
and the author of ``A Biographical Dictionary of Film.''
</P>
<P>
   Maslin wrote about music as well as film. ``Singer-songwriters
were her thing,'' Isaacs says. In fact, Maslin figures in what is
surely the most celebrated review in rock history, the one in which
Jon Landau (her then husband) wrote that he had seen ``rock 'n'
roll's future'' at a Bruce Springsteen concert at the Harvard
Square Theater on May 9, 1974 in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Maslin was elsewhere on Massachusetts Avenue that evening.
``When Jon wrote the famous column,'' she explains, ``we were
already on the verge of breaking up, and he said I was home asleep.
That's not true. I went to a double feature at the Orson Welles
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Kael, Newsweek offered Maslin a job in 1977.
She describes her year there as ``pretty unhappy.'' Then Canby
called to see if she wanted to be his deputy at the Times.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... the Times.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Newsweek stint did have one happy outcome: Maslin's second
marriage. It was the result of a classic case of what screenwriters
call ``meeting cute.'' Susan Cheever, the daughter of novelist John
Cheever, had the office next door, and the two became friends. On
visits to the Cheever home, Maslin met Susan's brother Benjamin,
himself a novelist. ``We didn't like each other at first,'' she
says, ``but then we did.'' They've been married since 1981, and
have two sons, ages 13 and 10. Appropriately enough, they live in
the heart of Cheever country, Westchester County: ``Sort of between
Pleasantville and Sleepy Hollow,'' Maslin jokes, ``and it's
beginning to scare me!''
</P>
<P>
   Maslin speaks of her father-in-law with great, if slightly
baffled affection. ``He had a funny way of making everything
special,'' she says. ``Things around him took on an interesting
valence. . . . He put a charge into the world, one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the growing lack of a charge in Maslin's professional
world that, in part, moved her to leave the Times. ``What happened
in the last year, and one of the reasons why I felt a need to go,
was that I didn't feel as much urgency,'' she says. ``I didn't want
to stay there and just hang on past the point where I couldn't
change gears and do something else. I may go back there. I don't
know what I want to do. But I feel like anything's possible now.
Five years from now I might not have felt that way. It just seems
like a good moment to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my kids. I love my husband. I love my life outside. But
it's not a matter of doing this so as to stay home. It's a matter
of seeking a new undertaking. Soon enough I'll be looking for
something to do, but if I had to know what it was now I wouldn't
have any kind of time out. It would just defeat the purpose. It's
great not knowing. It's terrifying, but very exciting. I could
pursue anything. The only thing I know is: no screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my big hopes is to get more conversant with computers.
Back when I was in college computers were as big as this room, and
everything was punch cards. Well, computers are rock 'n' roll now,
don't you think? The world is changing frighteningly fast. There's
a whole strange set of conventions growing up that nobody is paying
attention to. There are subversive yet powerful ways in which
that's going to change the way we process information and live our
lives and perceive popular culture. It's already changed movies
enormously, just in the narrative logic we follow. . . . I don't
know what's out there. I just sense some kind of an 800-pound
gorilla that I'd like to go look for.''
</P>
<P>
   So in between ape explorations, will Maslin be going to the
movies? Noting that there's a tenplex near her house, she says,
``Either all the time or never. I don't know which. I think for a
while it might be never.'' She takes a deep breath, then remembers
something. ``I'm going to go to Sundance (the film festival, in
January) and be on the jury, so that's 16 films I'll have to
watch.'' Those eyebrows arch, perhaps with relief, perhaps with
chagrin.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Banished to a desert island, what would be on Janet Maslin's
list of must-have movies? ``I'm very bad at remembering movies off
the top of my head,'' she says. With that caveat, she offers, in no
particular order, the following titles:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence of Arabia''
</P>
<P>
   ``All About Eve''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notorious''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxi Driver'' (``And I'd be glad I was on a desert island!'')

<P>
   ``The Godfather''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Like It Hot''
</P>
<P>
   ``Day for Night''

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Sometimes this column can be about safe driving. Sometimes it
can be about practical cars. Sometimes it can be about esoteric
cars that most of us can only dream about ever owning. But
sometimes, especially around Christmas, it can be about what that
holiday has come to mean to so many folks: stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in sometimes specific, sometimes generic mode, is stuff it
might be fun to find in your stocking, under your tree, or in your
garage come Christmas morning.
</P>
<P>

   --Give your loved one, son, oraghter these things: a bag of sand
(at hardware stores), a trenching tool (Army surplus stores), wool
blanket, new jumper cables, a bag stuffed with wool mittens, wool
hat, and felt-lined boots. Have them put them in their trunk for
winter journeys. It all could come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   --For the SUVer and 4x4 enthusiast for whom the snow tire is not
enough: a rubber track conversion for 4x4 vehicles that turns them
into tracked crawlers over snow, sand, swamp, and tundra. They bolt
on where wheels bolt on and then you crawl away. They start at

pictorial journey through New England's hot rod past. It's got the
clubs, the peple, th rods. Available through Hammershop Press,
508-543-1796; $29.95, plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   --Driving lessons. If you are the parent of a young driver, send
them to an advanced driving school. Sure they learned how to
parallel park and watch the rearview mirror in driver's education.
That is not enough. And if you own an SUV, get yourself an advanced
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   --Ah, the Danbury Mint catalog. A veritable treasure chest of
die-cast metal works of automobile art. This year, at prices
ranging from $10-150, I'm ordering: the 1946 Chevrolet Suburban;
the Indian Four motorcycle, complete with moving brake and clutch
linkages; a 1946 Dodge Power Wagon, built because returning GIs
wanted the rig they grew to love in the war; and a 1957 Chevrolet
Bel Air convertible, all chrome trim and tail fins.
</P>
<P>
   --Straight from fantasy land, in the world of what Mobilia
magazine calls A2K (Automobilia 2000) come these items: an original
1-12.5 prototype model of the first Volkswagen Beetle. It was sold
to a private owner in 1996 for $65,000, it's worth a lot more now _
if you can find it.
</P>
<P>
   --For NASCAR fans, and I know there are a handful of you out
there despite elitists who refuse to acknowledge your intelligence
and clout, five Winston Cup drivers are offering die-cast models of
cars driven in the century's final race at Atlanta. You can get the
Rusty Wallace Miller Lite 1999 Ford Taurus; Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s
ACDelco 1999 Chevrolet Monte Carlo; Dale Earnhardt's GM Goodwrench

down? Go fetch it with your die-cast Dodge Power Wagon 1949 Texaco
24-hour service wrecker. It's $45 from Denny's Diecast &AMP;
Collectibles, 888-919-0777.

this trio of muscle cars from 1970: a Ford Torino Cobra, a 1970
Chevy Nova SS, and an Oldsmobile 4-4-2. They're built at 1/43 scale
by wwwrtltoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   --Want to stir up controversy at your next cocktail party?
Mention that you think speed limits on many US highways are too
low, and that 100-plus miles per hour would be more realistic, as
long as the roads were upgraded. That's the basis of Mark Rask's
book, ``American Autobahn.'' He wants a high-speed highway with
full government support, and writes longingly of time spent on the
Autobahn in Germany, ``I had finally achieved what I had long been
searching for: A road and a government that permitted me _ playing
by its rules _ to drive as fast as I wanted.'' Available from
Vanguard Non-Fiction Books, PO Box 22370, Minneapolis, Minn.,
55422-0370
</P>
<P>
   --If you want a more leisurely trek through America, hop aboard
a Porsche Boxster with James Morgan in his book, ``The Distance to
the Moon.'' It's a combination of Lewis and Clark, ``Blue
Highways,'' and the old television shows ``Route 66'' (Corvette)
and ``Then Came Bronson'' (Harley-Davidson Sportster). Journey into
the body of America with the Porsche as its heartbeat, from bars to
weird art exhibits. It's all here, coast to coast. From Riverhead
Books, a member of Penguin Putnam, Inc., 375 Hudson Street, New
York, N.Y., 10014.
</P>
<P>
   --Finally, for a look into the future (10-20 years from now) and
a time when cars won't need gasoline or electric plugs, pick up
``Powering the Future,'' a look at the Ballard Fuel Cell. Tom
Koppel gives us a look at one of the leaders in the race to develop
the technology that will use hydrogen and oxygen to produce
electricity and have as its only byproduct, water. Clean,
efficient, and coming your way. From Wiley Publishers, 605 Thd
Ave., New York, N.Y., 10158.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to make sense of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day technology stocks climb, while the rest of the
stock market mostly just hangs around. Anything remotely connected
to the new economy is hot; old-economy companies can't get the time
of day.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market veterans say it can't go on this way, that we are
in a bubble that has to burst. But what if they are wrong? What if
this is just the beginning of a golden era for stocks and
technology?
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an imaginary look at the coming year on Wall
Street. Any link between the material presented here and reality is
purely coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 8 _ Electronic retail stocks soar on news that Christmas
Internet sales rose 150 percent from the previous year. Skeptics
who suggest the big percentage gain came off a very small base are
dismissed as Luddites.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 24 _ Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan announces the
central bank will not be raising interest rates anytime in the
forseeable future. ``We've got a brand new economy. Worrying about
inflation is Wednesday's news,'' crows Greenspan, who says he will
spend the next six months working on his backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 15 _ Fidelity Investments fires all of its bond and value
stock fund managers. ``We can't give this stuff away,'' explains
chairman Ned Johnson. At the same time, Fidelity announces the
launch of three new equity funds: Very Aggressive Growth, Super
Aggressive Growth, and Growth So Aggressive You Won't Believe It.
</P>
<P>
   March 8 _ The stock of Cisco Systems climbs 3 points, marking
the 80th day in a row the stock has risen. Cisco executives have no
comment. ``We'll say something if the stock ever goes down again,''
says Cisco's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   April 9 _ Outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. turns down $20 million a
year to play for the Atlanta Braves and tells a stunned nation that
he is quitting baseball to become a venture capitalist. ``Where I'm
going, $20 million is chump change,'' says Griffey. Nike announces
it will make a set of new commercials showing Griffey on the
telephone doing deals.
</P>
<P>
   April 20 _ Responding to competitive threats, America Online
announces it will give away its Internet service. AT&AMP;T counters by
saying it will provide free long-distance telephone service. Both
companies say they will make up the lost revenue through greater
volume.
</P>
<P>
   May 1 _ CarsRUs, an Internet auto dealer, goes public. By the
end of the first day of trading, it has a greater market value than
Ford and General Motors put together. ``That's no surprise,'' says
the fledgling company's CEO. ``We don't have all those big
expensive factories to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   May 9 _ Vice President Al Gore slips in the polls after he says
he has no problem with Internet taxes. Gore later recants. ``I
thought you said clarinet taxes,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   June 12 _ Amazon.com stock rises 10 percent as the company
announces its entry into yet another new line of business: selling
rubber bands over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   July 6 _ Merrill Lynch fires its chief of equity research after
he tells clients that Nasdaq stocks, up 73 percent for the year,
may be ``fully valued.'' His successor says technology stocks still
have plenty of room to run.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 1 _ Stuart, the rockin' redheaded star of the Ameritrade
commercials, agrees to play himself in an upcoming made-for-TV
movie about his life. Seinfeld's Jason Alexander will play his bald
middle-aged boss.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 15 _ Microsoft announces it is acquiring the nation of
India in a stock swap valued at $200 billion. ``It was the cheapest
way we could find to pick up software talent,'' says chairman Bill
Gates. Microsoft says it will probably spin off the Taj Mahal in a
future deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 15 _ The US secretary of education reports that the best
and brightest high school students are dropping out to start
Internet companies. In most cases school districts give their
approval if the dropouts promise to let teachers and principals
participate in any future IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 11 _ Technology stocks fall 10 percent in the annual
October correction. This year, the correction lasts just four
hours. Investors who buy on the dip make a killing.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 18 _ The chairman of NBC sports announces he will save a
few advertising spots in the upcoming Super Bowl for automobile and
beer companies. ``Call me nostalgic,'' says the chairman, who
readily admits he could have sold the entire package to dot.com
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 4 _ The stocks of electronic retail companies soar as an
influential Wall Street analyst predicts that December Internet
sales will be robust. When a skeptic suggests that retail sales
always rise in December, the analyst shoots back: ``Yeah, what's
your point?''

WHY THIS DEATH DIDN'T COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 13-year-old named Jesse Dirkhising was killed on Sept. 26 in
Rogers, Ark. Why didn't you know that?
</P>
<P>
   The police affidavit describing the circumstances of Jesse's
death is stomach-turning. Rather than sicken you, let me quote
instead from the much less graphic story that moved on the national
wire of the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to police, Davis Carpenter Jr., 38, and Joshua
Brown, 22, drugged and blindfolded Jesse Dirkhising, gagged him
with underwear, and strapped him to a mattress face-down with duct
tape and belts. Then the boy was repeatedly raped and sodomized
with various objects before he suffocated because of the position
he was in, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the apartment, police found handwritten instructions and a
diagram of how to position the boy. Other notes described
apparently unfulfilled fantasies of molesting other children. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``On the night of Jesse's death, Brown repeatedly raped the boy
while Carpenter watched, police said. Brown took a break to eat a
sandwich, and soon noticed the boy had stopped breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP dispatch leaves out a lot of horrifying details, but that
isn't the most noteworthy thing about it. The date is. The story
didn't move until Oct. 29 _ 33 days after Jesse was killed. AP's
deputy managing editor later admitted that the story was assigned
only after the Washington Times reported the grim facts in an Oct.
22 story headlined, ``Media tune out torture death of Arkansas boy:
Homosexuals charged with rape, murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse was killed a few days before the first anniversary of
Matthew Shepard's brutal murder. The contrast in the coverage of
the two cases is overpowering. The first AP report on the atrocity
in Laramie _ ``Openly gay student critically injured in Wyoming
attack'' _ moved just hours after Shepard was discovered, badly
beaten but alive. The story was front-page news around the country
and was followed for weeks by every television network and news
magazine in America.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Jesse Dirkhising, on the other hand, received
almost no notice in the national press. The belated Washington
Times and AP reports didn't trigger a rush of catch-up stories.
Only one television network, Fox, took note of the crime _ in a
single story on Nov. 23. And that was it. For all intents and
purposes, what happened to the seventh-grader went down the memory
hole. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Some critics suggest there is a media double standard: Violent
crimes committed against gays get big headlines; violent crimes
committed by gays _ even against children _ get a shrug. ``Had
Jesse Dirkhising been shot inside his Arkansas school,'' writes
Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center, ``he would have been an
immediate national news story. Had he been openly gay and his
attackers heterosexual, the crime would have led all the networks.
But no liberal media outlet would dare be the first to tell a
grisly murder story which has as its villains two gay men.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly. But there is an even more insidious explanation _ one
articulated not by media critics but by media insiders themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Provoked by Bozell's challenge and by messages from readers
wanting to know why the Dirkhising murder was being ignored,
writers at The Washington Post and the Time magazine Web site
offered a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Shepard's murderers were driven to kill by hate, the
boy's rape and death was a sex crime,'' argued Jonathan Gregg, the
senior editor at Time.com. Shepard's killers ``were not satisfying
some animalistic sexual impulse; they were bullies who gratuitously
killed someone out of hate for being different than they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's ombudsman, E.R. Shipp, made the same claim. She
acknowledged that her paper had run some 80 items referring to
Shepard, but only a single news brief mentioning Dirkhising. ``Here
at the Post, however, the two are seen as quite different,'' Shipp
wrote. A hate crime homicide such as Shepard's . . . is `a special
kind of killing,' the Post has editorialized. . . . Arkansas
authorities have not characterized the Dirkhising death as a hate
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Could anything make clearer the perniciousness of treating some
kinds of violence as ``hate crimes?'' Here lies Matthew Shepard,
beaten to death by a pair of savages. Here lies Jesse Dirkhising,
tortured to death by a different pair of savages. Each was an
innocent. Each died in agony. Each left behind grieving family and
friends. Each was the victim of a crime so vicious as to shock the
conscience. But because Shepard's savages detested homosexuals, his
death matters. Because Dirkhising's savages were driven by lust,
his death is a nullity.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime laws are immoral and unjust, for they are premised on
the notion that the lives and well-being of some people are worth
more than the lives and well-being of others. Journalism that
adopts the hate crime premise is equally offensive.
</P>
<P>
   It is no answer to say that ``hate crimes'' are uniquely toxic
because they threaten entire groups. If Shepard's slaying was
particularly alarming to gays, was Dirkhising's any less alarming
to the parents of young boys? Every violent crime spreads fear and
distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Buy into the ``hate crimes'' mentality and you buy into the
belief that some victims don't count because they didn't belong to
the right group. That is what happened to Jesse Dirkhising. He
deserved better.

THROUGH A BROTHER-IN-LAW'S EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago my sister Susan married an Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't fall in love with an Irish-American, but with an
honest-to-goodness Irishman from Waterford City named Pierce
Butler, who spoke with a brogue and hadn't set foot in the USA
until he was 20 years old. Our family embraced Pierce from the
moment we met him, but he was soft-spoken and a bit reticent, and
for some reason, in all the conversations we ever had, I never
asked him about the old country. In fact, when I wanted to learn
about what it was like to grow up in Ireland, I read ``Angela's
Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Pierce's own book, ``A Riddle of Stars,'' has just been
published by Zoland Books, and as I read it, I felt as if I were
meeting my brother-in-law for the first time. I hadn't known that
as a young boy Pierce spent his summers with relatives who lived on
the Inish, an island off the wild western coast of Ireland, or that
he remembered, with almost perfect clarity, his grandfather's house
with its outhouse and thatched roof and oil lamps glowing brightly
in the darkness of the lonely nights. There, amid lifelong grudges
and family evasions and thwarted love, the hero of Pierce's novel
plots his escape and resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when he arrives in this land of endless promise, Matt finds
himself thwarted by that childhood, with its unpaid debts and his
grief at being abandoned by his mother. When he falls in love with
an American woman named Lily, her optimistic faith in their future
seems as far out of his reach as the ``riddle of stars'' in the
Irish sky. Lily, of course, is a fictionalized version of my
sister, whom I have never seen through the eyes of a lover before.
Her father, who in the course of the book dies of prostate cancer
while in hospice in her home, is my dad to the bone, brought back
to life by Pierce's heart-rending observations.
</P>
<P>
   My father died in Susan and Pierce's house in 1994, and although
my brother and I visited almost every day, the two of them bore the
brunt of his care. When we showed up, we'd always ask politely,
``How did it go last night?'' but to revisit my dad _ in Pierce's
re-creation of the event _ lavishing praise upon a hospice nurse
while withholding affirmation from my sister, is to reexperience my
dad's unerring ability to inflict pain on those who loved him. Yet
I can also see how my father's charm, his disarming honesty, and
his zest for life make him an inspiring figure to an Irish boy
raised on silence and pessimism and passivity. It is touching to
see how my dad provoked love and resentment in equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only my family that's cast in a new light in Pierce's
book. Boston itself is a major character, looming out of the
headlights of Matt's car with a strange unsettling clarity as the
young Irishmen drives the streets of the city in an effort to
escape his demons.
</P>
<P>
   Take this description of the approach to the Tobin Bridge: ``In
a moment we are zooming up the expressway ramp with the Garden
rising in front of us like the Great Wall of China. To the left,
the skywalk stalks over the streets like a many-footed beast toward
the great hump of the Mystic.'' Or this one of the turnpike heading
into Boston: ``A sheer concrete retaining wall flies by on my
right; I'm below street level. The tunnel beneath the Prudential
Center rushes toward me, and I'm suddenly underground. Walls and
columns stream past, and my headlights flee across the ceiling.
(Mine) is the only car in here, beneath the unconscionable mass of
the Pru, the tons of streets, bridges, and pavements, burrowing
beneath the nighttime city, like a mole shunning the light.''
</P>
<P>
   To Matt, Lily's insistence on airing difficult feelings
represents an American mind-set that challenges his learned
hopelessness about changing himself or his fate. ``A Riddle of
Stars'' may be, as the Los Angeles Times wrote, ``an immigrant's
song,'' but when I heard Lily speaking words that might have come
from my own mouth _ ``If you don't want to talk, Matt, I can't
force you. But I can't pretend that everything's fine between us''
_ I could understand how the author's reserve had finally been
breached. And when Lily's faith in Matt's ability to understand and
overcome his history gives him the courage to say at last: ``I had
never been more aware of my love for her, not as a thought or even
as a feeling of the heart, but as a total experience of all my
being,'' I knew my brother-in-law had come home at last.

`A CIVIL ACTION'; TAKE TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Schlichtmann, the lawyer who litigated the Woburn, Mass.
toxic wells trial depicted in the best-selling book ``A Civil
Action,'' is back in court _ this time as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann has spent the past few days in front of a jury
arguing Cadle Co. v. Schlichtmann, a complex suit arising from his
old law firm's declaration of bankruptcy after the eight-year-long
Woburn case. Cadle, an Ohio-based company that buys up bad debt,
says Schlichtmann owes it a portion of his post-Woburn earnings. He
disagrees. The case has dragged on for several years, and motions
for summary judgment from both sides have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   They say Schlichtmann has mellowed, but I didn't get that
impression when I bumped into him in the corridor of the new
federal courthouse. (Architectural note: Henry Cobb's buildings
sure look nice from the inside . . .) He has retained the energy,
the charm, and the penchant for rhetorical excess aptly imitated by
John Travolta in the ``Civil Action'' movie. ``These people are
trying to destroy me,'' he said. ``They're notorious for pursuing
these cases all over the country.'' Later, he congratulated himself
on his own ``brilliant'' cross-examination of a Cadle executive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the post-Woburn demons still seem to haunt him. When I
registered surprise that he was back in front of a jury, he shot
back: ``Do you think I'd put my fate in the hands of a federal
judge?'' Ghost from the Past 1: The trial judge, George O'Toole, is
a former colleague of Jerome Facher, the Hale and Dorr lawyer who
represented W.R. Grace in the Woburn trial. Ghost from the Past 2:
Retired Judge Walter J. Skinner, who bedeviled Schlichtmann during
the Woburn trial, was conducting a mediation just two floors above
where we were standing.
</P>
<P>
   Thus informed, Schlichtmann just rolled his eyeballs. ``New
building, same old story,'' he sighed.

   What is the worst movie ever made? I always thought it was a
tossup between John Sayles's ``Piranha'' and the insufferably
precious ``Vanya on 42nd Street.'' But a new candidate has emerged:
``Dinosaur Valley Girls,'' a 1997 release from B-movie genius
``Dinosaur'' Don Glut, who has nurtured such memorable celluloid
outings as ``Bikini Drive-in'' and 1971's ``Schlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Glut is a hard man to pigeonhole. He is the co-author of a
well-regarded dinosaur encyclopedia, a dinosaur dictionary, and
``novelizations'' of the Star Wars movies. ``Valley Girls,''
occasionally featured on USA Network's ``Up All Night'' show,
remains his magnum opus. He tells me he is now raising money for
two movie projects, ``Dinosaur Valley Girls II'' and a vampire
movie called ``Blood Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad is ``DVG''? So bad that it circles the category and
almost reemerges as wonderful. The plot, such as it is, contrives
for Hollywood action star Tony Markham to be transported back in
time to Dinosaur Valley, where scantily clad starlets wander around
chucking spears and mumbling ``for sure.'' Think: ``Quest for
Fire'' meets ``The Vixen,'' minus Anthony Burgess, who penned the
caveman grunts for ``Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   B-stars abound: William Marshall of ``Blacula'' fame, has a
small role, as does onetime Oscar nominee Karen Black. Glut filmed
the lush outdoor scenes near Devil's Punch Bowl in Pearblossom,
Calif., and at Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles. Does the cave mouth
where Bam-Bee and Bar-Bee disport themselves look familiar? It
should; it was used in John Ford's ``The Searchers,'' ``Mighty
Morphin' Power Rangers,'' the Batman TV series, and countless
movies and shows in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVG'' is available from frontlinefilms.com. I recommend the
Family Edition, not the mildly spicy ``Director's Cut.''

arguably ran deeper than those of any other member of the Keating
Five.'' And a Globe colleague recently wrote: ``The Public Garden
is arguably the most beautiful, most open park in the nation.''

JAVA EYE OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Microsoft Corp. has done such a grand job of world software
domination it's easy to forget there are others who'd like to get
that same grip on a valuable market.
</P>
<P>
   But just in time for the possible dismantling of Microsoft comes
news from Sun Microsystems Inc. that should remind us all that no
company has a monopoly on the lust for power.
</P>
<P>
   Our story begins a couple of years ago, when Sun's Java
computing system was all the rage. That's the software that's
supposed to make it possible to write a single program that would
run on all kinds of computers without modification. Sun chief
executive Scott McNealy vowed that Java software would put an end
to the reign of Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, Sun announced with great fanfare that
it would cede control of Java to the International Standards
Organization, or ISO. In effect, Java would become an open
worldwide software standard certified by an organization
independent of Sun's control.
</P>
<P>
   The move was meant to send a come-hither signal to programmers
worldwide. By standardizing on Windows, they'd become laborers in
Bill Gates's cotton fields. But if they wrote their code in
ISO-certified Java, they'd be free at last.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost free. Because Sun didn't really want to give total
control of Java to ISO. The company wanted a brand-new kind of
arrangement that would make Java an ``open'' standard, while still
allowing Sun to have the final say over future development of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Microsoft, in an effort to fend off destruction in its
antitrust case, declaring that it would submit Windows to an
international standards body. But Microsoft would still have final
say over any modifications of the product. Windows would still be
what Microsoft says it is.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically what Sun wanted. The company would have been
able to tout Java as a true independent software standard, even
though it would have been no more independent than Windows is from
Microsoft today.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO was having none of it. Instead, it wanted to be the
final arbiter of Java's future. Other software companies, including
Microsoft, could put forward suggestions for modifications, and ISO
could add them to Java whether Sun liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Sun spent two years trying to sidestep the need for true
independence, but this week the dance ended. On Tuesday, Sun
announced that it was giving up on the concept of independent Java
certification. The product would once again be under the total
control of the company that had created it.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the company spend two years playing at openness, only to
back away now? Maybe because the charade has outlived its
usefulness. Back when Sun first made its move toward liberating
Java, the company's market capitalization was a mere $16 billion or
so. As of Wednesday, it was up to $122 billion. Profits have leaped
from $762 million to over a billion. Despite challenges from
cheaper computers running Microsoft Windows NT, Sun's high-powered
Unix workstations still dominate Internet computing, and maintain a
strong presence in corporate networks. And hundreds of thousands of
engineers now program with Java _ many lured by the pledge that it
would become an open standard.
</P>
<P>
   So Sun may now think it's strong enough to make Java a standard
the same way Microsoft established Windows _ by making a reasonably
good product and marketing the heck out of it, with no need for any
sham openness. Both IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Inc., dismayed by
Sun's policies, want to do clones of Java, but Sun got to market
first, and holds the high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ross, founder of the Java Lobby, a Java programmers' group,
thinks that as long as Java thrives, most of his colleagues won't
mind the Sun flip-flop. But Ross certainly minds. ``They had used
these commitments to gain credibility and acceptance, and now, for
whatever reason . . . have abandoned those commitments,'' Ross
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has a right to do as it likes with Java. But it's worth
remembering the promise of liberation that was once attached to
Java. That promise turned out not to be worth very much. In my
software-industry dictionary, I'm going to file Sun's use of the
term ``openness'' next to Microsoft's version of ``innovation.''
Both words mean the same things when these guys use them: Absolute
power.

 &HT;    King family hails jury finding of conspiracy in assassination
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs and Mike Morris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The wife of slain civil rights leader Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. said today that a Memphis jury's verdict that a
conspiracy led to the death of her husbandwas ``a great victory for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband once said, the moral arch of the universe is long,
but it bends towards justice,'' Coretta Scott King said during a
press conference at the King Center. ``Today, I feel that the
jurors's verdict clearly affirms this principle. With this faith,
we can begin the new millennium with a new spirit of hope and
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   King, along with family members and their attorney, spoke out
today in the wake of the month-long trial which found a Memphis
man, Loyd Jowers, guilty of being involved in a widespread
conspiracy to assassinate King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury was clearly convinced that the extensive evidence
showed that a conspiracy was deeply involved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   King attorney William Pepper presented evidence that convinced
the jury that James Earl Ray, long believed to be the gunman, did
not assassinate King. This was the first time that a jury has heard
evidence in the case. In 1969, Ray offered a plea bargain and was
sentenced to 99 years in prison. He died in 1998 in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got what we had been asking for, the opportunity to
get evidence before a jury,'' said Dexter Scott King, director of
the King Center. ``Because of the evidence and the information that
came out in Memphis, we believe this case is over.'' ``We know now
what happened, and for us, this is the final chapter,'' Dexter King
told CNN today. ``This is a very significant event in history.
History books have to be rewritten.'' A mere three hours after they
started deliberating Wednesday, a civil trial jury of six black
people and six white people found that Jowers, the former owner of
a greasy spoon restaurant, was involved in a conspiracy to kill
King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like triumph over tragedy,'' said Dexter King. ``The fact
that 12 independent jurors have spoken is all we've wanted and
we've ever asked for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a period at the end of a chapter for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   King's widow and her four children were awarded $100 in damages,
to go toward funeral costs. Dexter King said the family will donate
the money to a charity to benefit Memphis sanitation workers, since
it was their plight that brought his father to Memphis, where he
was gunned down April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial was not about money, the Kings have said since
filing the civil suit against Jowers last year. Instead, the family
wanted a jury to hear evidence that King was not killed solely by
Ray, who pleaded guilty in March 1969 but recanted three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty, Ray never faced a jury. He died of liver
disease in April 1998 while serving a 99-year sentence, still
insisting he was set up by a mysterious smuggler he only knew as
``Raul.''
</P>
<P>
   Although King's assassination has been investigated by federal
and Tennessee authorities, this was the first time a jury had
listened to evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) an associate of King, told WSB-TV in
Atlanta that he will ask President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno for a thorough investigation of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very gratifying to be given an opportunity before a
jury,'' said King family attorney William Pepper, who also
represented Ray in his final attempts to win a trial. ``This is all
James Earl Ray wanted. At least the family will benefit from this.
Most of the evidence that we presented would have been put forth in
a trial for Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror David Morphy said he thought the assassination was too
complex to be accomplished by one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was a cut-and-dry case, with the evidence
that Pepper brought forth that there were a lot of people involved.
Everyone from the CIA to the military had involvement in it,''
Morphy said. ``Jowers was involved in it, we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 90-minute closing statement Wednesday, Pepper talked
about conspiracies, cover-ups and Jowers' admission on nationwide
television that he was a part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, who owned and operated Jim's Grill in the same building
where Ray rented a room on the day of the shooting, told ABC News
in 1993 that he received $100,000 to hire a hit man. The rear of
Jim's Grill was across the street from the Lorraine Motel, where
King was staying when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers said he got the money from late Memphis produce dealer
Frank Liberto, who was alleged to have ties to a New Orleans
organized crime family. According to Pepper, the hit man was Earl
J. Clark, a now-deceased Memphis police officer who had won honors
at the FBI Academy for his sharpshooting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Although parts of Jowers' story have changed over the years, he
said the assassin fired his shot from behind Jim's Grill and then
handed Jowers the rifle to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison, said the lawsuit should have
been dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.
Garrison contended the Kings should have filed the lawsuit around
the time of Jowers' TV appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Garrison said, while it might be reasonable to conclude
that King was the target of a conspiracy, any role Jowers could
have played would have been minor.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison told the jury it was hard to believe that ``the owner
of a greasy spoon and an escaped convict'' could have pulled off
King's assassination. Jowers, who at 73 is suffering from cerebral
arteriosclerosis, was absent from court for most of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's verdict was welcomed by some spectators, including
Charles A.L. Oliver Jr., who said he has listened to every word of
the monthlong trial since the second week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt there was a conspiracy,'' said Oliver, 43. ``Now
we can be free and get on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For many in Memphis, the end of the trial brought closure.
</P>
<P>
   Tending his niece's gift shop on Beale Street, Lafayette Davis
said he delivered bread to the Lorraine Motel the day King was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about the trial because people want to
know what happened,'' said Davis, who has lived in Memphis since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   He said he missed King the morning of the assassination so he
and a friend went to the home of the Rev. Samuel B. Kyles to meet
King, who was to have dinner with the Kyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting at Kyles' house for King,'' Davis said. ``He
never made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neady Masters never got to meet him, either. On the stormy night
of April 3, Masters' sister heard King's ``I've Been to the
Mountaintop'' sermon at the Mason Temple. She told Masters how
inspiring it was and that she felt electricity after touching King.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I had to go see him,'' said Masters, 57, adding
that on April 4, she and a friend headed to the motel to meet King.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, traffic was bad that day, so my friend turned
around,'' Masters said. ``As we were driving back, we heard on the
radio that he had been shot. We could have been there. Had I been
driving, we would have been there.'' The trial will have
wide-ranging effects, Dexter King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will have to rewritten,'' he said. ``People can no
longer look the other way.'' Across town at LeMoyne-Owen College,
the only historically black college in Memphis, Clodetra McGee and
Samantha Mitchell, both freshmen, said they have been living with
theories about the assassination since birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should find out who really killed Doctor King so
that he can rest in peace,'' said Mitchell, 19. ``I never thought
James Earl Ray did it. I always thought it was a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, a prosecutor with the Shelby County district
attorney's office who has investigated the assassination but was
not involved in the Jowers trial, said the conspiracy claims have
no merit.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said several of Jowers' friends and associates said he
was merely hoping to get a movie or book deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this off and on for five years,'' Campbell said,
``and I've still seen nothing that would change my opinion.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Outer Space in a Dole's can
 &HT;    For release Dec. 12, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do you get the person who has everything?, is the wail of
many holiday season shoppers. I have a suggestion: A can of Dole's
Pineapple Chunks and perhaps its Pine-Orange-Banana juice.
</P>
<P>
   You see, you've got to have two UPC bar code proofs-of-purchase
of Dole's products to be eligible to win a trip to ``outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent double failures of unmanned Mars missions, the
shutdown of the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as the frustrating
facts that the space shuttle Discovery has had six recent launch
scrubs while six unmanned rockets have gone ``boom'' in the past
year and a half, I would think a simple turbo-prop flight from
Miami to Tampa would be sufficient to meet my adventure needs.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't even have known about this chance to win a trip to
``outer space'' had not my daughter, who reads, collects and uses
those incessant store coupons that slip out of the Sunday paper,
informed me of it. Among the coupons was the Dole presentation. You
need to enter by Jan. 31, 2000 to be eligible to win and there are
other small-print rules including that you can't be unhealthy and
that you can't be under 16.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to me that the under 16 rule is unfair because the
way things are going, the child could be a highly eligible 21 years
of age _ or older _ at the time of launch.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, both travel and aeronautical, are working on
space travel. Ask any of them when they expect to inaugurate
sub-orbital flights and you don't get a firm answer: Some say late
2002, some indicate even later. Inasmuch as I have no knowledge
that any of their space vehicles have been tested, or that
government approval has been received, I tend to think its further
rather than closer.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Dole's random drawing gets a choice: $50,000
or the space ride in a 60-feet-long Vela Technology Space Cruiser
that, in its Web site graphic, has the look of a delta-winged
airplane but with no engine on the swept-back wings.
</P>
<P>
   From London comes the news that the World Tourism Organization
has predicted space travel will be routine by 2020 and that low
orbit trips may take place within three years.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are suspecting a fly-by of the moon, forget it.
These are sub-orbital trips, the kind Alan Shepard took in our
first space flight. Up, then down, lickety-split. The use of the
term ``outer space'' is ambiguous in that the flight likely will
not reach higher than 63 miles. NASA space shuttles orbit several
hundred miles up, depending upon the mission.
</P>
<P>
   As far as ``outer space'' is determined, know that the U.S.
gives astronaut status to anyone who flies above 50 miles in
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   That having been said, the appeal of a flight anywhere above
where our commercial jets now fly is tantalizing. That, for
promotional purposes, you can get a chance to do it for free _
excepting a couple of cans of Dole's Pineapple Chunks _ makes it
even better.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed fares already have been established for people who
don't win the Dole's giveaway. In October 1997, Zegrahm Space
Voyages, proffered a two-minute flight for $98,000; $49,000 a
minute, which is even more than Roger Clemens gets paid to pitch
one minute for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Zegrahm was sold last month to Space Adventures but I would
assume the earlier price holds.
</P>
<P>
   I am not entering the contest inasmuch as I was born during the
Herbert Hoover administration and still bewildered about what keeps
jet planes up. But others seem to be signing up _ not necessarily
for the Dole's promotion _ but directly with the transit people.
According to a press release from Space Adventures, ``flights are
filling up already and the demand will rise quickly in anticipation
of first departures.''
</P>
<P>
   When will that be? Ask any Boston Red Sox fan when his team will
win its next World Series. The answer to when civilian space travel
will begin also lies somewhere there.

MANHATTAN'S MECCA OF MERCHANDISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's impossible to describe the ABC Carpet &AMP; Home
store in Manhattan's Flatiron District, the city's burgeoning
home-furnishings mecca, without resorting to the cliche ``organized
chaos.'' Any newcomer to the Broadway and 19th Street store, which
has become a destination spot for New Yorkers and out-of-towners
looking for a genuine Big Apple or holiday shopping experience,
might need a whiff of smelling salts to recover from the visual
shock of the store's ground-floor ``parlour'' and its dizzying
array of ``stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are five more floors, it's the first one that
sets the tone, captures the imagination, and personifies first-rate
marketing, merchandising, and the art of display.
</P>
<P>
   The parlour is many things. A blown-up version of an eccentric
great-aunt's overstuffed, overlaced, overchandeliered Victorian
parlor. A pack rat's dream, albeit a rat with a large trust fund. A
theatrical, high-end flea market or a bustling South American
bazaar or a Filene's-esque bargain basement or an outsize boutique.
Or a cave filled with stalactites and stalagmites of Venetian
glass, porcelain, decorative ornaments, china figurines, and beaded
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   There's absolutely no horizontal surface without a covering of
either plates, cups, lamps, clocks, bibelots, or most every other
accessory known to man. No rafter, wall, stair or support column
without chandelier, painting, or rug. No floor space free _ except
for walkways _ of pillows, pots, planters, garden seats or small
chairs, footstools, and benches.
</P>
<P>
   Such visual madness has proven to be very lucrative. Sales
figures for the store and its satellites _ which have opened in the
Bronx, Westbury on Long Island, and Delray Beach, Fla. _ topped
$175 million this year. Employees total 1,200. Customers who visit
the more than 350,000 square feet of selling space encompassed by
the four stores average 1 million annually. And last year ABC
assumed operation of the Oriental carpet division of Harrods in
London. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pushcart origins &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The store is run by the family triumvirate of third-generation
ABC chairman Jerome Weinrib and his daughter and son-in-law,
Paulette and Evan Cole. Weinrib runs the floor-covering division,
while Paulette is creative director and Evan is president and chief
executive officer of the home division.
</P>
<P>
   The store's origins are found in the immigrant era. Sam Weinrib,
a native of Austria, sold used carpet and linoleum from a pushcart
on the Lower East Side at the turn of the century. His son, Max,
turned the pushcart into a store. Max's son, Jerome, transformed
the store into the largest rug and carpet store in the world. Today
the family owns both 881 Broadway, with its three floors of
carpets, and 888 Broadway, the ABC store and former home of W. &AMP; J.
Sloane, the premier home-furnishings store of the 1880s. That store
was part of what was called Ladies' Mile, the exclusive shopping
district for New York's upper class and birthplace of the
department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision started with the building and wanting to re-create
what was once here,'' says Evan Cole by phone during a buying trip
to Seville, Spain. ``We wanted to impart the whole feeling of a
Victorian department store and bring it into the late 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   With the vision in place from the start, says Cole, he and his
team worked from the ground floor up, adding more and more
merchandise with each floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly evolving and refining,'' says Cole, who was a
Hollywood agent before coming to New York and ABC. ``That's why
it's always different every time a customer comes here. It's like a
moving feast. Things are constantly changing on every floor.
There's always an element of discovery.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A world of rugs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's start from the top. The loftlike sixth-floor space is
impressive, with natural daylight streaming in through huge windows
onto unpainted brick walls and colorful rugs hanging from walls,
lounging across furniture, or piled in knee-high stacks. This is
the floor where handmade rugs from Tibet, Nepal, and India mingle
with antique Turkish and Persian offerings. For those without deep
pockets, there are also contemporary and cotton rag and braid rugs
along with machine-made rugs and the popular sisal.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth floor is filled with antique estate furniture,
reproductions, handpainted pieces, and upholstered items dressed in
tapestries, jacquards, velvets, and damasks. There are no so-called
vignette seating arrangements at ABC _ this is not a store for
ordering matching sofa and chairs, but more a collector's dream
house of the unusual. However, in a bow to conformity, there are
sections for Ralph Lauren and Baker furniture, because ``we don't
want any shopper to have to go anywhere else,'' says Loren Pack,
publicity and advertising director. ``Some people are looking for
these well-known brands. They've seen a Baker dining set in a
magazine and want it. They come here and order it and then end up
buying a rug upstairs and some accessories.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth floor features less formal furniture, along with
American folk art and a bit of whimsical frog art in the Toad Hall
section. A big consumer draw is the third floor, with its 50 beds,
including cribs and bassinettes, and more than 300 sheet patterns.
There are also decorative pillows of every shape, size, and fabric,
as well as chenille throws, matelasse coverlets, silk charmeuse
duvet covers, towels, and bathroom hardware and fixtures. The
second floor features furniture from Mexico, Peru, Indonesia, and
India, along with Danish modern and American pine. And finally, in
the basement, 5,000 bolts of fabric are organized by color. &QL; 
 &QL; 
First-floor eateries &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now back to the first floor for a bite to eat.
</P>
<P>
   There are several choices. The year-old food hall offers such
specialty foods as pate, smoked fish, breads, teas, and more than
300 cheeses, along with takeout meals and made-to-order sandwiches.
Colina, a new addition to the store, serves Italian Tuscan fare in
a rustic restaurant with a direct street entrance at 35 East 18th
St. But in keeping with the store's ambience is the popular Parlour
Cafe, a microcosm of the store where the ceiling drips with glass
chandeliers of varying vintages and shoppers dine on mosaic tables
while seated on overstuffed chairs and velvet settees. Everything's
for sale here, too.

DECLARING WAR ON SPAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic junk mail is the scourge of the Internet. More
commonly called spam, junk e-mail wastes money and time, it turns
people away from the Internet, and most of it is just plain ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, system administrators from all over the United
States met in California at the Third Spam Roundtable to discuss
the growing problem. The results were not encouraging. Between 15
percent and 30 percent of the e-mail that America Online receives
is spam. Most large Internet service providers have a team of four
to six people dedicated to combating the problem; unsolicited
commercial e-mail is costing these companies roughly $1 million
each month, which translates to $1 to $2 per subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the real kicker: the junk e-mail problem is likely to
get worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   It's the crazy economics of the Internet that created the junk
e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a piece of paper mail, which costs 25 cents to $1 to
send, there is no per-message charge to send e-mail: it's included
in your monthly fee. Although this works out great for people who
want to keep in touch, the economics lend themselves to abuse. All
a spammer needs to send out a million copies of a message is a
dial-up Internet account, a million e-mail addresses, and a desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a friend of mine visited an AOL chat room
called ``Parent Soup.'' A few days later, her mailbox was filled
with 40 messages directing her to gay pornographic Web sites. In
all likelihood, a spammer had been monitoring the chat room,
recorded her e-mail address, and added it to his list. If you are
an AOL user, practically the only way that you can protect yourself
from this kind of attack is to use a different screen name for chat
rooms than for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey conducted earlier this year by
ChooseYourMail.com, pornographers are responsible for 30.2 percent
of the spam on the Internet today. Just behind the sex merchants,
29.6 percent of spam hawks get-rich-quick and work- from-home
schemes, many of them illegal. The remainder of the spam advertised
assorted products and services; a small percentage illegally offer
stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the best way to protect yourself from being
spammed was to be cagey with your e-mail address. That is, if you
avoided putting your e-mail address on a Web page, if you didn't
participate in on-line discussion groups, if you didn't join chat
sessions, you were pretty safe.
</P>
<P>
   But hiding your e-mail address is becoming less effective every
day. At the Spam Roundtable, I learned that more and more spammers
are resorting to dictionary attacks, where they send e-mail to any
address that's likely to be valid. If the message gets through,
that's great for the spammer. If the message bounces, the spammer
doesn't care, since the bounces usually end up in some beleaguered
system administrator's mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Although some states have passed laws that attempt to regulate
spam, none have been particularly successful. Federal attempts,
meanwhile, have been worse. Last year, Senators Frank Murkowski, a
Republican from Alaska, and Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey
Democrat, proposed legislation that would have made it illegal to
send spam to people who specifically had opted out, or asked not to
receive the junk mail, but legal to send it to everyone else.
Although the bill passed the Senate, it died in a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many antispam activists opposed the legislation because it
legitimized spam. For the same reason, many spammers rallied behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the real spam problem in the coming year won't be from
fly-by-night operations and scam artists, it will be from
legitimate companies that view unsolicited bulk e-mail as a way to
market themselves more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how much e-mail you would get if every store where you
ever had shopped, or every store where you ever might shop, sent
you an e-mail once a week telling you about a special offer. Your
e-mail quickly would become unusable.
</P>
<P>
   This January, the Direct Marketing Association will announce an
opt-out database for electronic mail called the e-Mail Preference
Service. The database is supposed to be a list of people who do not
wish to receive marketing information by e-mail. That sounds good
at first, but many spam-fighters fear that the DMA will use its
database to legitimize e-mail marketing in general. This argument
has merit, since the DMA's two other databases, the Telephone
Preference Service and the Mail Preference Service, have been used
to legitimize telemarketing and paper junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a computer user to do?
</P>
<P>
   Today there are a number of filters that you can use to separate
the spam mail from the good mail. The best filter that I have seen
is BrightMail. Although it's designed to be used by Internet
service providers and corporations, the company recently started up
a service for individuals. You can find out more at
http://www.brightmail.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The second way to fight spam is with legislation. Write to your
lawmakers and tell them what you think about junk e-mail. The
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail has put up a
detailed information center about legislative attempts to stop spam
at http://www.cauce.org/.
</P>
<P>
   If you get spam e-mail, you can send it to the Spam Recycling
Center, at spamrecycle(at)ChooseYourMail.com. For information,
check out http://www.spamrecycle.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can tell the stores where you shop that you don't
want them sending you e-mail. And if catalog companies ask for your
e-mail address, don't tell them.
</P>

LAW WILL TRY TO SHUT DOWN HARRISON, BROKEN HAND AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Cornerback Ty Law will be on pins and
needles Sunday, and not because of the predicament of his team or
the presence of Colts wide receiver Marvin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   When Law and the Patriots journey to Indianapolis to face the
red-hot Colts, he will be there with his broken right hand held
together by three pins and the discomfort deadened by pain-killers.
Obviously, this is not the ideal circumstance for a cornerback to
be in when facing the league's most prolific pass catcher, but that
is the circumstance Law will face after having surgery Tuesday to
stablize the hand he broke Sunday night while slamming the Cowboys'
Raghib Ismail to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The pins were inserted to stablize the hand, which means Law
will have to wear a modified hard cast wrapped in padding just to
get on the field. What it also means, he expects, is an increase in
business coming his way when Harrison and quarterback Peyton
Manning go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what type of receiver Marvin Harrison is,'' Law said
Wednesday. ``I'm quite sure they realize what kind of competitor I
am. This is the first broken bone I ever had, but this is football.
Once you're on the field, you don't think about anything but
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure I'll see more balls than I normally see because
I can't pick the ball off. If anything, I can just bat it down.
It's going to be frustrating to know you're going to see more balls
than I've ever seen and I can't catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that circumstance does arise, Law won't be as frustrated
as he was Sept. 19 when, with two healthy hands, he watched
Harrison catch six passes for 100 yards and three touchdowns in the
first half to help put the Colts ahead, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   Angry over the soft defenses he was being asked to play, Law
vented his opinion at halftime. In the second half, the Patriots
played far tougher man-to-man defense and Harrison made only one
more catch for 5 yards, which helped New England catch
Indianapolis, 31-28, on Adam Vinatieri's 26-yard field goal with 35
seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Law has not forgotten that game and probably neither have the
Colts, which means both will have a point to make this time. The
problem for Law is he must make his point without being able to
point his finger at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is playing better than the Indianapolis Colts, except
maybe the Jacksonville Jaguars,'' Law said. ``But we want to let
them know when they play the Patriots, they can't beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost seven straight to New England and 10 of 12 since the
Drew Bledsoe Era began, Law has a point. But this time Law will be
at a significant disadvantage in his personal battle with Harrison,
who leads the NFL in receiving yards (1,239) and touchdowns (12).
Not only will Law be hard-pressed to catch the ball, he'll be
hard-pressed to press Harrison at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I jam him and it hurts, I'll have to play a soft press,''
Law said. ``I can't wear a soft (more flexible) cast. They told me
that's totally out of the question. They told me there's no way I
can do that because the pins might break.''
</P>
<P>
   Logically, if Law can't wear a soft cast because of the severity
of the break, just how bad a break was it? ``You're talking to a
sports marketing major in college,'' Law joked. ``I have no idea. I
don't know what's going on. All I know is I got three pins in there
and it's broke straight through.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Law understands that come Sunday no one will
want to hear about the condition of his hand. They'll only be
concerned with the condition of his feet and whether they can stay
with Harrison all over the RCA Dome. If they do, someone will be
nominating him for the Red Badge of Courage Award. If they don't,
they'll be nominating him for the Scalding of the Week Award, a
circumstance Law long ago accepted as part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm able to play, I got to play,'' Law said. ``(The cast)
is irrelevant. Whether we're playing man or zone I got to do the
job. If the ball comes to me, I'll try and catch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll approach the game the same way. I'll approach Marvin
Harrison the same way. I have to play what the defense calls. Every
game against Marvin Harrison is a battle. He catches some. I catch
some. It's not one-on-one all the time, not Ty Law vs. Marvin
Harrison all the time, but it's an all-out brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is, the guy with his hand in plaster would seem to be at a
unique disadvantage. Unless you talk to him about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to Indianapolis, I'm playing,'' Law said. ``And if I'm
on the field, don't put me away from Marvin Harrison. Don't try to
cover me up. Put me out there on that island and let me do my
thing. If I can't play that way, I don't want to play at all.''

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vice president of a large ski company commented privately
the other day: ``This is getting scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was talking about the current lack of snowpack in
the northern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new about warm autumns, or December meltdowns. Nothing
new about an upper air pattern that blocks the cold Arctic air out
while the warm soup spreads from the South all across New England .
. . and sits for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this before. But, what if this is new?
</P>
<P>
   What if there is a permanent warming going on? So far as anyone
can tell amid all the political wrangling about global warming, no
one really knows. Or at least no one has been convincing one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Certain pieces of data seem unsettling _ the shrinking of the
polar ice cap; the fact that some species of migrating waterfowl
from the Canadian maritimes do not range as far south to their
ancestral wintering grounds anymore (Just ask the fifth generation
goose-hunters from Maryland's Eastern Shore who see a fraction of
the birds that used to return for winter).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, we humans are semi-schooled at best in the long
rhythms of climate and geological evolution and do not know whether
we are dealing with a real change in the planet's climate or merely
moving through cycles heretofore unrecognized. After all, in terms
of accurate record-keeping, meteorology is a relatively new
science.
</P>
<P>
   Our long-term memory often proves untrustworthy in recreating
accurate pictures of our past. A week-long power outage caused by a
blizzard in Feburary when we were 8 years old will color our
memories of winter for a lifetime. We might conjur up images of the
Klondike, home of Sergeant Preston and King, as we remember and
long for our nostalgic past.
</P>
<P>
   In those ringing days, there was always deep fresh morning snow
after nightly blizzards. The skiing was limitless. The winter life
as gay and robust as some old David Niven movie set in a Tyrolean
resort.
</P>
<P>
   But, back to the dismal reality of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sure there have been winters, and starts of winters, like this
one. Warm autumns, with unrelieved weeks of tepid soup that retards
natural cycles even of flower and insect. Check out your backyard.
</P>
<P>
   But no, we'll skip the global warming for now and take the easy
explanation. The warm autumn is just that, and made all the worse
because of heightened expectations of skiers with pent-up energy
carried over from last year's stingy season. And with the Christmas
week fast approaching, the collective knot in the stomach of the
ski industry is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Peak, one of the most naturally snowy mountains in the
Northeast, intends to open its new lift, the Green Mountain Flyer,
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,500-foot lift, designed to carry 2,600 skiers per hour,
was going to provide some free skiing Saturday for those attending
the opening celebration. Not now. The celebration will take place
sans the skiing and boarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, but with a little cold weather we'll have the
skiing going hopefully for the holidays,'' said Jay Peak spokeman
Conrad Klefos.
</P>
<P>
   The American Skiing Company, with its six New England and two
Rocky Mountain resorts, has put forth a bet with skiers. By the
holidays, says ASC chairman Les Otten boldly, ``We will have
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   ASC areas have often touted guaranteed skiing, but this year
they are making an even greater promise to vacationing skiers and
boarders: ``If we can't give our guests at least 70 percent of
their mountain, we'll activate the guarantee,'' says Otten.
</P>
<P>
   The guarantee will give guests a 25 percent price reduction on
their next visit this season and a voucher worth up to $500 toward
a vacation at The Canyons in Utah or Steamboat in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is made to guests reserving a ski vacation between now
and Dec. 24 and is good for vacations between Christmas and Jan. 2,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, according to ASC spokesman Skip King, the
resorts are taking the risk out of booking a ski vacation during
the holidays. ``We know people down there are concerned with the
amount of snow they're going to find,'' said King. ``Our bottom
line is if you go skiing over the holidays you'll have a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ASC guarantee applies to Sunday River, Sugarloaf/USA,
Killington, Mt. Snow, Sugarbush, and Attitash/Bear Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some resorts we can open four to six trails a day,'' said
King. ``And we're looking for some natural snow, too. We'll have
the stuff. If not we'll activate the guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, with 26 of 120 trails currently open at Sunday River, King
is hoping that the forecast for cold weather after this weekend
will come true. With about two weeks to Christmas, even at the rate
of 4-6 trails a day, 70 percent coverage seems ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' says King. ``We've got our work cut out for us.
But if people get here, they'll have a good time.''

TOUGH CHOICE FOR SAN FRANCISCO VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco voters have a real choice in bad
choices in the Dec. 14 election.
</P>
<P>
   They can vote for an arrogant, abrasive big-time politician who
has been an underachiever in a job of high expectations _ mayor of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can vote for an arrogant, abrasive small-time politician
who has been an overachiever in a job of low expectations _ San
Francisco city supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   If those descriptions of our two candidates sound harsh, it
doesn't mean I don't like either Mayor Willie Brown or Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano. I enjoy their intelligence and
wit. They are true San Francisco characters and they give good
quote.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as my guidance counselor said about all us losers,
laggards and layabouts, they have potential.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if they are often arrogant and abrasive. Arrogance
can be good in an elected official, as long as that official does
good and delivers the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Roosevelt was arrogant, but that quality helped him fight
monopolies. Phil Burton, the former California congressman, was as
abrasive as anyone ever seen in Congress, but he always looked out
for the poor, the environment and fought the moneyed special
interests _ which always outdo mere mortal politicians in the
arrogance department.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was Burton's protege, but you'll never see him fighting
big money.
</P>
<P>
   A mayor should serve wider, deeper and larger interests than
real estate moguls, builders and corporations. He should serve the
people who elect him.
</P>
<P>
   A mayor should get the people to and from work on time, help
them find shelter if they need it and make a city a safer, more
beautiful and more efficient place.
</P>
<P>
   The latter means spending less of the citizens' money and
getting more for it. What a concept in a city where you always pay
more and get less.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has appointed friends, political hacks and inexperienced
young people to everything from the Board of Supervisors to
solid-waste czar. It wasn't until his re-election loomed that he
brought in a professional as head of Muni to try to make the trains
and buses run on time.
</P>
<P>
   He was like a brilliant student waiting for the last minute to
do his homework.
</P>
<P>
   Brown hasn't even seriously taken on the homeless issue,
canceling a ``homeless summit,'' failing to notice homeless
encampments in the park, then threatening to call in surveillance
helicopters on them. To roust or not to roust, that was the
question he dodged.
</P>
<P>
   He's like a bright student who signed up for a very tough
course, didn't go to class and then dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has potential, but will he live up to it in the next four
years?
</P>
<P>
   You can't call him a late-bloomer, the way Barbara Bush calls
George W., because he fully bloomed as speaker of the Assembly.
Maybe he's coasting, another word my guidance counselor used.
</P>
<P>
   He's even coasting on other people's work. During the campaign,
he spent much of his time taking credit for the booming local
economy, which is just another way of claiming to have invented the
Internet, the force behind the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of national stars have risen from comedy clubs in San
Francisco, but few from the perpetual open-mike night of the Board
of Supervisors. Dianne Feinstein, now the senior senator from
California, is one of those who made the big-time, perhaps because
she's as serious as they get.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is quick with the quips, but underneath he's deadly
serious. The problem is he's often deadly serious about the
superficial, silly and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about overachieving in a low-achievement field. This is the
man who has led the symbolically resolute Board of Supervisors in
introducing symbolic resolutions. He's championed endangered
hardwoods, downtrodden Zimbabwean gays and oppressed overweight
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been a Robin Hood trying to take from the rich and
give to the poor, although the arrows in his quiver of tax
proposals all turned out to have rubber tips and bounced off.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Wall Street Journal wants to make fun of San
Francisco, they do a library search for ``Ammiano'' and
``resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the class clown, driven by the deeper dissatisfactions of
the perpetual outsider. He's the kid always raising his hand and
making the snappy comments. He's the rebel with many causes.

THE CUBAN SCHOOLBOY VS. AN AMERICAN BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are times as an American citizen that I
want to hang my head in shame or, better yet, fly a plane with a
message banner over a foreign country and tell its people: ``I
apologize for my government.''
</P>
<P>
   The sorry case of Elian Gonzalez, 6, of Cuba has created just
such a time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I've missed something in this story, something that makes
the United States' inhumane manhandling of the situation excusable.
</P>
<P>
   All I keep finding is more evidence that this is bully-boy
exploitation and political posturing at its most offensive. (I find
it especially in the arrogant, patronizing smirk of State
Department spokesman James Foley, who seems to take Cuban protests
of the incident about as seriously as he might a video game.)
</P>
<P>
   So Fidel Castro postures back, visiting Elian's kindergarten
like some Hispanic Mr. Rogerarshaling hundreds of Young
Communists to take to the streets of Havana. Can you imagine what
the White House would be doing if the situation were reversed?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that a 6-year-old boy from Kansas City was the only
survivor of a private plane crash just off the shores of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that the boy's mother, divorced from his father but
sharing custody, had taken their son out of the United States to
live in Cuba without the father's knowledge or permission.
</P>
<P>
   Then imagine the Cuban government refusing the Kansas City
father's request to return his son to him. Imagine one of Castro's
ministers announcing that the ``most appropriate humanitarian way''
to resolve the issue was to treat it the way a Cuban custody case
would be treated and place it in the hands of a Cuban provincial
judge.
</P>
<P>
   We would have aircraft carriers heading for Havana harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with communist Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida, have
grown increasingly absurd over the past decade. At the same time we
toast diplomatic and financial ties with a human rights-abusing,
totalitarian nation like China, we continue to shun and punish Cuba
as if it were the same scary, Soviet-backed maverick that pointed
missiles at us during the Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest chapter lends a new meaning to absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   And to punishment.
</P>
<P>
   A little boy who just watched his mother drown in the sea has
become a kickball in a contest between the world's most powerful
capitalist nation and one of the world's few remaining Marxist
throwbacks. Everything that is wrong, stupid and wasteful about
U.S.-Cuban relations is being played out on young Elian Gonzalez's
head _ and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Unites has an exclusive policy for Cuban
refugees _ if they make it to U.S. soil, they're eligible for
permanent residency _ a biological father with shared custody
rights has been told to cool his heels until a Florida family court
judge decides what is ``best'' for his son.
</P>
<P>
   And, on the boy's sixth birthday, the closest he could get to
his dad (and four grandparents, best pal and teacher) was a
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent you a lot of little kisses so you have a happy
birthday,'' said Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, from his
home in Cardenas, Cuba. ``Are you coming back soon?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' little Elian piped back. ``Tell (my classmates) to take
care of my things.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us hope that, in the name of doing the ``most appropriate
humanitarian'' thing, the world's model of personal freedom and
democracy does not make those Cardenas kindergarteners take care
forever.

YOUNG ADULTS FORM BACKBONE OF AMMIANO'S SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ EunYoung Lee, a 30-year-old Web page designer
with a silver ball pierced through her tongue, said she had never
volunteered for any kind of political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not until Tom Ammiano, the president of the governing Board of
Supervisors, won a spot in the Dec. 14 mayoral run-off election in
an unprecedented write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I already know him as a person,'' Lee said Tuesday
during her first day as a political operative at Ammiano's campaign
office.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, a former school teacher, gay activist and sometimes
stand-up comedian, has tapped into the angst and latent idealism of
Generation X in his campaign to unseat Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's campaign offices buzz with youthful energy _ a crowd
of 20- and 30-year-olds who are swept up in the excitement and hope
generated by Ammiano's surprisingly successful grass-roots
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is 57 and hip. He is down to earth and against Big Business.
He rides public transportation and wears ink-stained shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is considered an outsider working on the inside, an
image that disillusioned younger voters gobble up.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful group, mostly people who rent, coalesce around
Ammiano's favorite causes: rent control, protection from evictions,
a living wage and the disappearance of affordable artist lofts.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Vivian Chang, 29, said they were volunteering because
they see a chance to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we are making history,'' said Chang, who as a
resident of Oakland, cannot vote in San Francisco. ``You think
about what happened on Nov. 2,'' the day of the general election
when the candidate won second place in a crowded field. ``I don't
think something like that could happen in any other U.S. city.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called slackers are growing up. And it turns out that
despite low expectations for the much-maligned cynical generation,
they want to shape their own future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd be here without them. It's the engine
driving the campaign in some ways,'' said Ammiano campaign
strategist Robert Haaland, who is 35.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken just before the Nov. 2 election showed that 56
percent of voters under age 30 supported Ammiano. One-fourth of
that age group said they supported Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Among voters 65 and older, just 6 percent supported Ammiano
while 45 percent supported Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 65, the city's first black mayor, has spent a lifetime in
politics, earning him fund-raising power and influence with state
and federal officials. Although both men are Democrats, Brown is
seen as friendlier to the city's booming business community.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime San Francisco pollster David Binder said the trend his
poll detected in early November still holds steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such an age gap,'' Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an age gap. It's a generation gap,'' said political
consultant Robert Barnes, a Brown supporter who also conducted
recent polls for the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian and Gay Democratic
Club, which endorsed Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes found that among gays surveyed, the typical Ammiano
supporter is under 40, white, liberal, a renter, earns $35,000 a
year or less and has lived in San Francisco 10 or fewer years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown's typical supporter in the gay community is
older, has lived here more than 10 years, owns a small business or
home and is in a steady relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that if you are under 40 and shaved, pierced or
tattooed that you are for Ammiano,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, asked about his appeal to young voters, said he speaks
to people who are left outside the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is about grass-roots power and welcoming people
in,'' Ammiano said.

   FLA-DEATHPENALTY _ Florida lawmakers have called a special
legislative session on the state's death penalty. Foes are gleeful,
saying any attempts by lawmakers to change the rules will lead to
more appeals and ultimately may mean there might not be any more
executions in the state for years. (Date, Palm Beach Post). 18-20.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANES _ The number and intensity of Atlantic storms will
ease next year, but not by much, according to professor William
Gray and his colleagues at Colorado State University in Fort
Collins. In their annual forecast, released Wednesday, they are
predicting a ``moderate'' season in 2000 with 11 named storms,
seven hurricanes and three intense hurricanes. Gray said the
residents along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, including Florida, have a
45 percent chance of being hit by one or more major storms with
winds above 100 mph. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post). 8. WITH CHART.

   GORE-SOUTH _ WASHINGTON _ If Al Gore wins the Democratic
presidential nomination, it will be because of the South. The Old
Confederacy is his ace in the hole should he stumble in the early
voting in Iowa and New Hampshire. As a consequence, he rarely lets
a week pass without tending to his Southern political supporters _
and especially African Americans. For example, he'll be in Atlanta
this weekend for a meeting with black voters before heading to
Orlando for the Florida state Democratic convention. (Shepard, Cox

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SYRIA _ JERUSALEM _ For decades, Syria has been the
Doctor No of Middle East peace, lambasting Egypt for making peace
and firmly maintaining its state of war against Israel. But, by
Thursday morning, Tel Aviv law clerk Odelia Arad, 28, could
seriously state that she hopes to someday ``eat hummos in
Damascus.'' ``I would like to see the place. It is right next
door,'' Arad said. Though attempts at bringing a peace between
Syria and Israel have ended in failure before, this week's
announcement that talks will begin again in Washington next week
raised hopes that one of the toughest obstacles to peace in the
Middle East could finally be removed. We look at key issues,
reaction in Israel and Syria, and what may have lead to the
breakthrough. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Julianne Moore
with Ralph Fiennes in ``The End of the Affair.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Since he starred in ``The English Patient'' (1997), Ralph
Fiennes has been acclaimed as ``the thinking woman's sex symbol.''
 &HT;    And, speaking of thinking women, independent-film veteran
Julianne Moore is widely known as one of Hollywood's most
intelligent actresses.
 &HT;    So what's it like when the two get together between the sheets
for ``The End of the Affair,'' a new adaptation of the classic
Graham Greene novel?
 &HT;    Pretty steamy, to hear Moore tell it.
 &HT;    ``The love scenes had to be torrid,'' she says unhesitatingly.
``Our characters are choked up with passion. We must show this is
no one-night stand _ they are literally consumed by the physical
passion they have for each other. It was all about sex at first,
but when they fall in love it only intensifies their sexual
appetites for one another.''
 &HT;    Not every actress would sign on for so much sex and nudity
without thinking twice, but then Moore, who will turn 39 on Dec.
30, is not every actress. Known as an extravagant risk-taker, she's
proven that she'll do whatever it takes to make a role work.
 &HT;    She shook moviegoers out of their seats by going bottomless to
deliver an extended monologue in Robert Altman's ``Short Cuts''
(1993). She was Oscar-nominated for ``Boogie Nights'' (1997), in
which she improbably made a sympathetic character out of a
drug-addicted porn star, and earlier this year she displayed
satin-smooth villainy as a scandal-mongering widow scheming to
entrap Jeremy Northam and Rupert Everett in ``An Ideal Husband.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she wasn't an obvious choice for ``The End of the
Affair,'' having to beat out scores of well-known British actresses
for her role as a beautiful, conflicted Englishwoman in one of
Greene's most Catholic novels, based on an actual event in the
novelist's life during World War II.
 &HT;    Fiennes plays Maurice Bendrix, a tormented novelist who falls
madly in love with Sarah Miles (Moore), who is trapped in a sexless
marriage with a boring civil servant (Stephen Rea). Adding to the
volatile situation is that her husband and Bendrix are close
friends.
 &HT;    As bombs explode over London and most sane people flee to
shelters, the couple joyously make love, until one night something
happens to shatter the affair and plunge them into a moral conflict
that brings misery to them both.
 &HT;    Moore wanted the part badly _ so badly that, having only
recently given birth to her now-2-year-old son Cal, she pumped
enough breast milk to let her leave the baby briefly to fly to
London to test for the part.
 &HT;    Hiring an American to play Fiennes' lover was a gamble, but
writer/director Neil Jordan _ best known for ``The Crying Game''
(1992) _ says he took it without hesitation.
 &HT;    ``What got Julianne the role,'' he says, ``was the instant
chemistry obvious from the first day she and Ralph worked together
_ from the moment they first met, really.''
 &HT;    Moore agrees that the two stars felt an instant attraction.
 &HT;    ``Ralph is an incredibly sexy man,'' she says, ``not because of
his looks, but because of his intelligence and the confidence he
exudes.''
 &HT;    As for the sex scenes, Jordan says, they have a quality rare in
an American movie _ they are about real, adult people.
 &HT;    ``In our movie it really looks as though they are having sex,''
Jordan says. ``It's clumsy and beautiful at the same time _ not
what you usually see in a Hollywood film.''
 &HT;    Moore's greatest asset as an actress _ the chameleon quality
that enables her to adapt so completely to each character that she
is almost unrecognizable from one role to the next _ has so far
kept her from achieving the all-important ``brand name'' star
status, despite several previous forays into consciously mainstream
films.
 &HT;    But ``End of the Affair'' could be the movie that moves her onto
the A-list. Already there's a hot Oscar buzz for the actress whom
moviegoers no longer confuse with that other screen siren named
Moore.
 &HT;    The un-Demi comes by her adaptability honestly. The daughter of
a psychiatric social worker and a military judge, she grew up as a
self-described ``geek,'' one of several actresses whose ``Army
brat'' childhoods taught them how to blend into a role. She lived
in 23 different home towns before arriving at Boston University's
School of Performing Arts, where she earned a degree in acting.
 &HT;    From Off-Broadway plays, she branched out into television with
parts on the daytime soaps ``The Edge of the Night'' (l985-l988)
and ``As the World Turns'' in the late 1980s. On the big screen,
she met a grisly end in the thriller ``The Hand that Rocks the
Cradle'' (1992), then had a small but eye-catching role as a
supportive doctor in Harrison Ford's box-office hit ``The
Fugitive'' (l993).
 &HT;    From Day 1, she adamantly resisted typecasting. She played an
actress in Louis Malle's intricate ``Vanya on 42nd Street'' (l994),
then appeared as Hugh Grant's pregnant girlfriend in the mainstream
romantic comedy ``Nine Months'' (l995). She was Picasso's troubled
mistress Dora Maar opposite Anthony Hopkins in ``Surviving
Picasso'' (l996), then turned up in Steven Spielberg's ``The Lost
World: Jurassic Park'' (l997). Last year she played a bizarre
seductress opposite Jeff Bridges in the Coen brothers' ``The Big
Lebowski'' (l998).
 &HT;    Now she has no fewer than three high-profile films coming out at
the same time. Besides ``End of the Affair,'' there's ``Map of the
World,'' which stars Sigourney Weaver, and ``Magnolia,'' in which
she plays Tom Cruise's looney stepmother for ``Boogie Nights''
director Paul Thomas Anderson.
 &HT;    But it's ``The End of the Affair'' that stands to win her star
status, not to mention possibly turning her into a sex symbol.
Predictably, she has no qualms about nudity or sex scenes in her
movies, nor any worry that they'll turn out tasteless or
gratuitous.
 &HT;    ``I don't need a nudity clause in my contract,'' she says,
``because I will only work with people I know won't exploit me.''
 &HT;    She does note that Fiennes _ who shared some passionate love
scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas in ``The English Patient'' _ went
out of his way to make sure his co-star was comfortable.
 &HT;    ``Ralph treated me with such concern and tenderness in those
nude scenes,'' the actress says. ``He was protecting me the entire
time, which allowed me to be far more liberated.
 &HT;    ``Ralph was very brave and a good sport,'' she adds with a
laugh. ``We had fun making jokes about his beautiful rear end. But
I felt like the tables were turned _ usually it's the woman who
worries about what she looks like naked.''
 &HT;    The film is very different from the l955 screen version, which
starred Van Johnson, Peter Cushing and Deborah Kerr. The story may
be set in the 1940s, she explains, but the remarkably graphic love
scenes could never have been shown to audiences of 50 years ago.
 &HT;    ``The only way you knew Deborah had sex was when you saw her
putting her earrings back on,'' she says. ``In our film, they can't
keep their hands off each other.''

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ James McGuirk remembers how he and other
neighborhood children would run after the fire engines that clanged
past their homes. He would scamper along proudly, point at the man
perched on the end of the ladder and shout, ``That's my Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk also recalls how he and other friends would gather at
the station in the city's Burncoat section, climb all over the fire
engines and slide down the fire pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firemen were heroes to us, just by being hre' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To McGuirk they were also family.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1942, when James's father, Francis A. McGuirk, rew weary
of his wire factory job and joined the Worcester Fire Department,
the McGuirks have carried on a proud tradition serving on the
firefighting force.
</P>
<P>
   Francis McGuirk's brother William joined after him. Then came
their sister Catherine's son, their sister Mary's son, their sister
Alice's son and two grandsons, and then William's son.
</P>
<P>
   Nine McGuirks in all have served, including Joseph T. McGuirk,
38, of Leicester, who died in the fire at the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co. building Friday. The family has
collectively given more than 200 years of service to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   And they have suffered heavily for it.
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph McGuirk, affectionately known as Joey, perished in
the blaze that engulfed the warehouse, he became the fifth McGuirk
to die of fire-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The family was always aware of the risks of what they considered
an honorable calling. James McGuirk said his father tried not to
speak of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to worry us,'' said McGuirk, his eyes filling
with tears. ``But what happened to Joey is something we all grew up
with. We knew what the risks were.''
</P>
<P>
   In those early days, the work held even more peril. Until the
1970s, Worcester firefighters did not have individual air tanks to
protect them from the fumes. ``Firemen were smoke eaters,'' said
McGuirk, now 61, who heads the science department at South High
Community School.
</P>
<P>
   He said he watched his uncle, William T. McGuirk Sr., die of
fire-related damage to his heart and lungs. His own father and his
cousin Robe Johnson ded of heart problems that were deemed to be
job-related. Another cousin, John McMahon, died from injuries
sustained on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job,'' said William T. McGuirk Jr., Joseph's
brother, who retired in 1985 after 20 years of service. ``But the
equipment's getting better all the time. And you help save a life,
save someone's property. It's very gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   There were McGuirks on the scene on March 3, 1946, when sheets
of flames, whipped by high winds, leapt 300 feet in the air from
the North Works warehouse of the American Steel and Wire Co. before
firefighters quelled the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirks battled in sweltering summer heat on July 12, 1960,
when fires raged out of control for four hours, gutting the Charles
Dowd Box Co. warehouse on Ludlow Street.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirks fought the tragic flash fire in the Indian Hill section
of Worcester in 1968, when five teenagers were trapped in their
clubhouse and died; and the inferno that destroyed two plastic
factories in Webster Square on May 4, 1977; and the arson blaze
that claimed seven lives on April 20, 1983, in the Central
Community House about two blocks north of Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The McGuirks came from Ireland, emigrating during the Great
Potato Famine of 1847. They began in eastern Canada and made their
way to Worcester in the 1880s, where they worked as tenant farmers
or factory workers in the wire mills.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGuirk came to Worcester as a child and married an
Irish immigrant, Annie Doyle. They had 14 children; nine survived.
Francis A. McGuirk was the only one of his siblings to get any
college education.
</P>
<P>
   He was a family ader. ``Everyone looked up to him,'' said his
son, James.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph T. McGuirk, who died in Friday's fire, was the most
recent member of the family to be inducted into the force, having
been sworn in two years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his relatives, he had always wanted to be a
firefighter and quickly bonded with the others in his unit, Engine
No. 3. ``He was very friendly, popular, and well-respected,'' said
Bernie Bastardo, 56, a fellow firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Bastardo remembered other McGuirk relatives, Joseph McGuirk's
cousins, who became firefighters: Robert Johnson, who served from
1949 to 1974, ``a very professional guy with a good sense of
humor,'' he said; and feisty John J. McMahon, who fought fires for
more than 35 years before his death in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew each other. We're all working-class people, all in
the same boat together. . . . We like going to work,'' Bastardo
said. ``And we're all hurting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastardo was sitting with some of his comrades on a concrete
bunker Tuesday near the charred remains of the warehouse. Behind
them, a fire engine was festooned with wreaths, flowers, and notes
of gratitude for the six men who died.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were still sifting through the smoldering rubble, but
treacherous conditions continued to make their search difficult.
Only one body had been found.
</P>
<P>
   William T. McGuirk was standing near the fire engine, exhausted
by the vigil at the fire scene.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to speak for all the McGuirks when he reflected on
their firefighting tradition: ``It's in the bloodlines. It's in
this family,'' he said. ``It's a dedication, like a calling.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue and frustration of thsearch for his brother's body
were in his voice, and the sadness of yet another loss for a family
that has given so much for Worcester.

<P>
   Is a Picasso painting on your holiday gift list? Are you on a
quest for an Elgin pocket watch made in 1890? What about a Prada
bag, John Hardy silver braided bracelet or maybe just one big
diamond?
</P>
<P>
   All of these may be purchased on the Internet in less time than
it takes to shower for a shopping trip. Find all the pashmina
cashmere shawls you can count and almost enough bubble bath and
bath gels to fill the Grand Canyon with suds.
</P>
<P>
   The world of cyber shopping for fashion and beauty products is
getting crowded. From basic tried-and-true catalog brands such as
Lands' End and J.Crew, the options are expanding to include a flood
of upscale indulge-yourself sites and beauty stores. One new site
is, in fact, called indulge.com.
</P>
<P>
   In this thriving economy when people with big money are spending
big money, surfing the Net is a bit like strolling down New York's
Fifth Avenue where luxury retailers such as Cartier and Bergdorf
Goodman evolve into discount camera stores and jewelers who seem to
be forever going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Consider LuxuryFinders.com, with a Picasso painting and David
Webb's $19,000 earrings, Ashford.com with Montblanc pens and
vintage watches and buyarock.com for diamonds. Bluefly.com, the
off-price site, has Prada bags and shoes discounted up to 50
percent. The company sold out of $79 pashmina cashmere shawls in
three days. The cashmere sweaters at $750 are among the choices on
neimanmarcus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of beauty sites offer everything from lipsticks, skin
care products and personal consultation to pamper-yourself
products. Check off your gift list with bath gels, skin lotions,
aroma fragrance candles and bath soaps in a few hours of clicking.
</P>
<P>
   With such a new medium growing so quickly, the big issue is
customer service. Everyone is racing to raise the level of perks to
attract shoppers from traditional stores and to set themselves
apart from their competitors. Gift suggestion lists, basic gift
wrapping and free shipping are some of the offerings. Magazines,
chatty columns, celebrity makeup items and e-mailed trend updates
are meant to enhance the experience as entertainment. Return
policies vary, but some sites allow anywhere from 30 days to
forever to send back unwanted merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that last year everyone was enamored with the idea of
the Internet,'' says Jeremy Hauser, research analyst for Lands'
End. ``This year people want more shopping aids.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the challenge of getting a good fit, Lands' End,
for instance, offers you the opportunity to submit measurements and
create a ``personal model'' on which to try clothes. A consultant
is available by telephone or interactive site to move you
electronically to where you want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing designer Norma Kamali at omo-norma-kamali.com supplies
online personal shoppers out of her New York boutique OMO. They not
only make selections for you, but they also send clothes out on
trial to try on in your home without charge. You have 48 hours to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Webby, a cyber model compiled from a wide range of ethnic faces
from all over the world, will be helping out at beautyjungle.com in
a few months.
</P>
<P>
   And promotional efforts, including advertising campaigns in
major fashion magazines, are impressive. Actress Tracey Ullman was
recently on NBC's ``Today Show'' promoting purpledress.com.
</P>
<P>
   Location, location
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the big question these days for such a new venue is:
If they build it, will consumers come? Does anyone buy cashmere
without a feel? Will you choose a $100 fragrance without a whiff?
</P>
<P>
   Some people see the Net strictly as a replenishment source where
you go for a red lipstick, a man's dress shirt or a fleece top.
People who buy pricey goods will still want the experience of the
store, the service and the smells. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Ghive, who heads Internet services for Doneger Group, New
York retail consultants, disagrees. She says the Web is an ``added
element. If I'm going to buy Gucci, I may go to the store. But two
days later, if I decide I want a handbag, I'm not going back to the
store.'' The businesses in the best positions for the moment are
those with both sites and retail stores, she says, such as Neiman
Marcus or Nordstrom's.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed industry insiders acknowledge Web shopping is in a
fledgling stage. But Boston-based Forrester Research Inc. predicts
8.6 million household shoppers will spend $4 billion on the
Internet between Thanksgiving weekend and year's end. Forrester has
traditionally been bullish about apparel potential, urging business
to move quickly in that direction. The company anticipates that
most money will go to ``researched items'' such as electronics and
home furnishings, followed by ``convenience goods,'' such as a CD
or a J.Crew sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Overall the mood is optimistic as the holiday shopping moves
into full swing.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online Inc., sales tripled during the three-day
Thanksgiving weekend last year, says Patrick Gates, vice president
of E-commerce. Four million AOL members apparently made purchases,
600,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   During the Thanksgiving weekend, sales at bluefly.com went up
700 percent over last year, says CEO Kenneth Seiff.
</P>
<P>
   QVC's iQVC.com had $1 million in sales on Sunday of Thanksgiving
weekend, with jewelry and clothing among the top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   And when beautyjungle.com launched last month, the company had
gift bags to give to the first 10,000 site visitors. Executives

`GREEN MILE' TAKES LONG, ENGAGING JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom). 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King's popular serial novel ends with the lament,
``sometimes, oh God, the green mile is so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Darabont's three hour-plus film adaptation of ``The Green
Mile'' will probably elicit similar comments from many viewers _
but minus the implied sense of agony. That's because, out of all
the movies this season that take much too much time to tell their
essentially short stories, this one trudges along most engagingly.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from sensitive performances to burnished
cinematography (by ``The Phantom Menace's'' David Tattersall) to
that tough-to-nail quality of effortless tonal management is done
with deliberate, exquisite care. That doesn't disguise the fact
that Darabont and company are making a portentous mountain out of a
narrative molehill here, but it does bring an unusually high degree
of entertainment value to the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   And for what it's worth, this ``Twilight Zone'' episode of a
tale does possess interesting resonances, although in all the time
adapter-director Darabont spent he still failed to plumb them all
fully. He gets the most obvious theme, an updated Christ story set
in a 1930s Louisiana prison, all right. And he does pretty well, if
a little too timidly, by the story's anti-death penalty subplot.
The thing's racial politics are just plain goofy, though, and
Darabont makes no effort to confront or rebut King's
paternalistic/mystical take on African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this was a film designed to appear important and
humanistic, but one that was unwilling to challenge its perceived
mass audience in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Told in flashback by a strangely troubled old man, the movie
proper takes place over the last months, in 1935, of the remarkable
John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gentle, childlike giant of a
man who seems utterly incapable of having raped and murdered two
little girls but has been convicted of the acts anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He's a new resident on Cold Mountain Penitentiary's Death Row,
dubbed the Green Mile for the sickly lime paint covering the floor
that leads to the execution chamber. The Mile is run by Paul
Edgecomb, the most decent fellow who has ever worked in a Southern
penal system _ we know that because he's played by a chubby, even
cuddlier-than-usual Tom Hanks _ and Edgecomb insists on running a
low-key, respectable operation. His veteran staffers _
second-in-command Brutus ``Brutal'' Howell (David Morse), old-hand
Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn) and nice young family man Dean
Stanton (Barry Pepper) _ are all committed to making their doomed
charges' final weeks as pleasant as circumstances permit.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, circumstances often don't. The Mile's key
roadblocks to harmony include a sadistic little weasel of a new
guard, Doug Hutchison's Percy Westmore, hated by colleagues and
inmates alike but protected by an aunt who's married to the
governor. And there's also a troublemaking sociopath, Wild Bill
Wharton (Sam Rockwell), who refuses to go into that good night, or
even sit in his cell, quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Once the good and bad people have been unmistakably delineated,
Darabont eases us, slowly of course, into the story's moral
conundrums. Edgecomb, whose younger version is introduced to us
with a bear of a urinary infection, at one point finds his crotch
clutched in Coffey's massive fist. Moments later, the big guy
exhales a mass of shimmering particles and, to the delight of both
Paul and his wonderful wife, Jan (Bonnie Hunt), the boss suddenly
feels great down there.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey's miraculous healing abilities are further demonstrated
on a little mouse the cellblock adopts _ and that we are given more
than ample opportunity to adore. Tedium gets broken by several
interestingly ritualized electric chair fire-ups, one of which goes
grotesquely awry. But the main drama here, of course, unwraps
around the question of Coffey's evident saintliness and inevitable
sacrifice. The nicer white folks, at least, feel mighty bad about
all that.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, as he so reliably can, humanizes his paragon of penal
virtue in an earthy, unfussy and wholly satisfying way. Duncan
exudes sad sweetness towering enough to match his frame, though
little of the real angst someone forced, against their preference,
to suffer in the name of others would naturally feel. Hutchison and
Rockwell are memorably, irredeemably hissable. And as other
prisoners, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene and Harry Dean Stanton
register well.
</P>
<P>
   Darabont's only other feature directing effort was ``The
Shawshank Redemption'' five years ago. Like ``Green Mile,'' it,
too, was an overlong-Stephen King-prison story. And like that one,
the new film will certainly have its passionate champions. It's so
well-crafted that it seems like a feast, even when your brain is
telling you that this story could not possibly be stretched any
thinner. &QL;

AS IRISH CAPITAL PROSPERS, ITS TOURIST APPEAL GROWS RICHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN HOLDER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The doors around Merrion Square line up like
the paints in a preschooler's watercolor tray: red and green and
blue and pink and yellow and black.
</P>
<P>
   I'm quite intrigued and I can't figure out why. They are just
doors, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The two quick days ahead won't allow me much time to really get
an understanding of Dublin, the complicated, now prosperous Irish
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here are these doors, stealing away precious minutes. They
do that to visitors, who snap pictures by the roll. Shops sell key
chains, postcards, prints, posters, even Christmas tree ornaments,
all celebrating them. No other feature of Dublin seems quite so
omnipresent. What is it about them?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I might have trouble finding my way home here in the
Georgian section. Many of the town houses are nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   The vividly painted doors set each house apart, of course. But
the beauty isn't in the doors per se. It's all around them, points
out Deirdre Burns, a former schoolteacher and native Dubliner who
now helps tourists get a grasp on her city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doors often gave an indication of the status of the house,
particularly on Merrion Square, where the aristocracy lived,''
Burns said one October morning as we strolled around Merrion
Square. Most of the homes belong to businesses now.
</P>
<P>
   Notice the fanlight over the door, she said. The leaded glass
design of one might look like simple rays stretching out from the
sun, but the one next door more closely resembles the spindles of a
ship's wheel. Another looks like a spider's web. The sidelights
flanking each door are distinct, too.
</P>
<P>
   So are the boot scrapers protruding from each stoop. And how
about that mini-manhole cover on the sidewalk? Coal was once
delivered there each day. The foundries made sure these were
singularly ornamental, too.
</P>
<P>
   I knew there was something special about this place. It must
have been quite the neighborhood during Dublin's building boom of
the early 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Some big names from Dublin's past are said to have lived here:
The poet W.B. Yeats. Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell. The
writer Oscar Wilde, who was born in one house and spent some of his
adulthood in another.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilde remains, by way of a statue, reclining on a large rock
in Merrion Square, across from his home, now part of the American
College.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to while away the day here at Merrion Square, with
its lush, green-even-in-October lawn and schoolchildren in their
caps and plaids. But the rest of Dublin won't wait.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart
</P>
<P>
   This is a city teeming with activity, block after block after
block, and nearly perfect for exploring on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Midafternoon on a Monday, Grafton Street, the city's main
shopping and pedestrian thoroughfare, is almost shoulder to
shoulder with businesspeople, shoppers and tourists. One street
musician plays a traditional Irish tune, while down the street
another sings Elvis Presley. Tourists pose for pictures with a
statue of the mythical fishmonger Molly Malone at the end of the
street.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are jammed with cars as well. Traffic has become a
real problem, I'm told, because many residents finally have been
able to leave the buses behind for their own cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland is suddenly prosperous, and the last few years have
brought many immigrants _ once almost unheard of in Ireland _ to
Dublin, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is up, too. ``Dublin has become a very popular place for
weekend trips from the Continent over the last few years,'' Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Temple Bar neighborhood, she said, is one hot spot. ``They
even have dancers on standby to teach you to riverdance, believe it
or not,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago Temple Bar was a neglected area in the
middle of Dublin. Now it's the bohemian section, known for music
and dance clubs, pubs and funky little shops crowded along narrow,
cobblestone streets.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on weekends, the streets and restaurants become
packed. But even on a warm fall afternoon, it's a great place for
people watching.
</P>
<P>
   Old vs. new
</P>
<P>
   Its proximity to Trinity College, just to the east, no doubt
explains in part Temple Bar's popularity with young Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity, on the other hand, relies on the old to draw visitors.
It's also a place where you can begin to learn about the political
and religious history of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity College was founded by Queen Elizabeth I in 1592 as a
Protestant college for men. Even as late as the 1960s Catholics had
to get special permission to attend _ or face excommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's must-see attraction, indeed one of Dublin's, is the
Book of Kells, an elaborately decorated edition of the four Gospels
that dates to the eighth or ninth century, maybe even earlier.
Tradition says the work was finished in the Abbey at Kells, in
County Meath. It's been at Trinity since 1661.
</P>
<P>
   Only two pages _ one a page of text from Luke, the other a
portrait of St. John _ are on display under glass in the college
library. The dimly lit, almost hushed room creates a reverential
atmosphere for this relic. It's a work that defies you to be
unimpressed _ by the craftsmanship if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   These gospels were written on calfskin, using quill pens made
from the feathers of swans and geese. The text is impressive, to be
sure, but what really struck me was the rich detail of the
illustrations. I could have stared at St. John for hours, seeing
more and more images and details, some almost daring me to notice
them.
</P>
<P>
   Religious roots
</P>
<P>
   Like Trinity, politics and religion compete for attention at
many of this city's attractions. Walk through central Dublin and
you'll notice _ well, at least if you have a guide as savvy about
Irish history as Burns _ that only Protestant churches are on the
main thoroughfares. The English, who ruled Ireland for 700 years,
wouldn't allow anything else. Catholics, 90-plus percent of the
Irish population _ were permitted to build churches only on side
streets. Burns points out a Franciscan congregation, the Church of
Adam and Eve. Its entrance for many years was through a tavern.
</P>
<P>
   Dublin's most prominent cathedrals _ Christ Church and St.
Patrick's _ belong to the Church of Ireland. Both date to the 12th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic or Protestant, the strength of Dublin's Christian roots
is undeniable. St. Patrick himself reportedly baptized
fifth-century converts at a well outside where the cathedral now
stands. Yet even Ireland's patron saint is almost overshadowed
there by another name: Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Swift was the church's dean from 1713 to 1745. He's
buried in the church nave and celebrated throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he is remembered for ``A Sermon on Sleeping in Church,''
not that other work, Gulliver's Travels. (But don't miss the modern
apartments across the street, where concrete medallions recall the
Lilliputians, the Houyhnhnms and the Brobdingnag giants.)
</P>
<P>
   Bad memories
</P>
<P>
   Dublin's most politically charged site may also be the place
where it traces its very origins: Dublin Castle.
</P>
<P>
   The castle garden marks the spot where the rivers Liffey and
(now underground) Poddle once joined to form a black pool or
``Dubhlinn.'' The city sprang up around the confluence of these two
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But many Dubliners remember it for something else. ``Dublin
Castle used to be a place whose name struck great fear into the
Irish,'' Burns said. It symbolized English rule, was home to the
English viceroys and even served as a prison.
</P>
<P>
   King John ordered the building of the castle in 1204. The castle
undercroft and its Record Tower remain from those first years, but
much of the rest was built over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Dubliners even viewed a statue of justice atop the castle as a
sign of England's disdain. ``The woman depicting justice faces in
toward the castle, with her back toward Dublin,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the castle is Ireland's own, a place for important state
events, such as the inauguration of President Mary McAleese in
1997. It's even a film star: The 1996 movie ``Michael Collins,''
about Ireland's struggle for independence, was partly shot there.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring it out
</P>
<P>
   Dublin is a lot to sort out in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to my hotel, I have to cross through the
Georgian section one last time. That's when I find myself at 29
Lower Fitzwilliam St.
</P>
<P>
   Another townhouse, a gray door this time. But it's open.
</P>
<P>
   Dublin's Electricity Supply Board and the National Museum of
Ireland has restored this home to the way it must have looked when
Olivia Beatty and her family lived in splendor there at the turn of
the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Delicate Italian plasterwork decorates the ceiling of the foyer.
The house is filled with Chippendale tables, Turkish rugs, a
grandfather clock made of sandalwood, huge windows with heavy
draperies, oil paintings with gilded frames and beautiful
chandeliers. A tug on the gold ropes hanging from the ceiling and
she could call any of her three servants, including a live-in
housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   What a life, I think. Then I learn a little more. Beatty was the
widow of a wine and paper manufacturer and the mother of three
children. I decide she might even be a symbol for Dublin:
Prosperous, sure, but her life was obviously more complex than it
first seemed. And her story was worth hearing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Round trip airfare between Kansas City and Dublin recently ran
as low as $600. If you're headed elsewhere, consider Dublin as side
trip. Round trip from London's Heathrow Airport recently started
about $175.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   - Holiday Inn, 97-107 Pearse St. The regular quoted rate is
about $160 for a single, but I got a package for $111 a night,
including breakfast. The hotel is within walking distance of
Trinity College, the Georgian section and most central Dublin
sites. Telephone: 01-670-3666. E-mail: info &LR; holidayinndublin.ie.
Web site: www.holidayinndublin.ie.
</P>
<P>
   - Isaacs Hostel, 2-5 Frenchmans Lane. Isaacs describes itself as
the longest established and best-known hostel in central Dublin.
Winter prices are quoted from about $9.50 to $24. Telephone:
01-855-6215. E-mail:hostel &LR; isaaces.ie.
</P>
<P>
   - Merrion, 21-24 Upper Merrion St., between Merrion Square and
St. Stephen's Green. Set in four restored Georgian town houses
dating from the 1760s. Prices start about $270. Telephone:
01-603-0600.
</P>
<P>
   - Shelbourne Hotel, 27 St. Stephen's Green. Described as one of
Europe's grand old hotels. Prices start about $225, Telephone:
01-676-6471.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around
</P>
<P>
   Dublin has no subway system, but buses are plentiful and
inexpensive. Check a map first, though. Central Dublin is fairly
compact, and most sites are within walking distance of one another.
</P>
<P>

SCREENWRITER, AUTHOR SHARE EXPERIENCE OF TURNING BOOK INTO FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screenwriter James Schamus and director Ang Lee steer clear of
best sellers and easy reads when they go looking for material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood typically buys books with no characters and just a
couple of major plot points and a couple of sex scenes _ and that's
all they need,'' Schamus said during a recent visit to Kansas City
for the regional premiere of their latest effort, ``Ride With the
Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, later on they realize there's nothing there to work
with, and they end up making the same old movie we've already seen
a dozen times before.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the locally shot ``Ride,'' which opened in Kansas
City, New York and Los Angles on Nov. 24 and is now widening to
other major markets. It is most certainly not the same old movie.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Missouri writer Daniel Woodrell's 1987 novel Woe to
Live On, it's a gruesome yet poetic look at the conflict as seen
though the eyes of a teen-aged Confederate guerrilla caught up in
an escalating war of atrocity and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   After the film's debut here, Schamus _ who in addition to
writing and producing movies teaches film at New York's Columbia
University _ and Woodrell, of West Plains, Mo., sat down to discuss
the tricks of turning a novel into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ang and I tend to look for the challenge,'' Schamus said,
``for some kind of resistance that says we've got to make a movie
rather than just a filmed book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Woe to Live On, that challenge was to be found in
the novel's language, a curious blend of down-home phraseology and
florid 19th-century ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were far better writers than people are today,'' said
Woodrell of the Civil War soldiers whose letters and diaries he
studied before writing the novel. ``Their main literary influences
were Sir Walter Scott and Shakespeare. Scott in particular gave the
South plenty of ridiculous romantic notions that they tried to live
up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Schamus praises Woodrell's novel as ``a completely literary work
with unbelievably rich language, and yet it's incredibly cinematic
_ the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick was to find a cinematic and narrative way of capturing
the book's unique literary voice. The novel is a first-person
account by Jake ``Dutchy'' Roedel, who displays unexpected
eloquence and subtle psychological shadings.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, this paragraph:
</P>
<P>
   We made trash of men and places. At Sweet Springs we found the
houses of two Unionists who had tried to waylay Cave Wyatt when he
had visited his mother there. Both men were unaware of us and smug
_ but not for long. Cave put amens to their miserable existences
after delivering unto them a knotty sermon. Their homes became
beacons.
</P>
<P>
   This weirdly lyrical passage describes with breathtaking economy
the ambushing, torturing (the ``knotty sermon'') and killing of two
enemies, followed by the burning of their houses. Jake's genteel
choice of words distances us _ and himself _ from the horrible
reality.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you put that scene in a movie and achieve the same
effect?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can't do it,'' Schamus said. ``Film has an
immediacy that hits you in the face. We often found ourselves
toning down the material.''
</P>
<P>
   A filmmaker's vision
</P>
<P>
   The first scene in the book describes how the guerrillas
surprise a family of German immigrants who are staunch Unionists.
The father is lynched, and when the man's 12-year-old son attempts
to cut him down, Jake shoots the boy. We immediately understand
that because his own German parentage raises suspicions among his
colleagues, Jake wants to prove his loyalty through ruthless
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrell explained: ``Redemption is only important if it can be
offered to those who have been down a really ugly trail. I'm not
talking about adulterers and tax cheaters. I'm talking about people
who have done things so bad they can't let themselves think about
it. That's Jake's situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But what works brilliantly on the page may be too ghastly to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw that happen on the screen, you would recoil so
badly you'd never recover,'' Schamus said. ``Just seeing it, you'd
never understand why it happened. And you'd never accept Jake as
the protagonist you're to follow for the rest of the film. He'd be
forever tainted as a bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   An early draft of Schamus' screenplay had Jake shooting the
12-year-old only after the boy picked up a gun and attempted to
attack the guerrillas. That way, at least, the killing seemed less
like the cold-blooded murder of a child.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the entire passage was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ang wanted that scene in the movie,'' Schamus said. ``But
could we possibly get away with it? Finally we had to respect the
reality that we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film is tremendously faithful to the book in tone. As
much as 70 percent of the dialogue in ``Ride With the Devil'' is
drawn directly from the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's that good, why mess with it?'' Schamus said.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous instances Jake's thoughts, appearing in the book as
interior monologues, have been converted into dialogue and spoken
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrell is grateful that his ``linguistic stew'' somehow was
translated to film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really amazed that they could retain it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the novel begins with the guerrilla riders and only
reveals the main characters' histories in piecemeal fashion, the
film takes a straight chronological approach.
</P>
<P>
   Schamus created a prologue _ centering on a wedding _ that
establishes the comfortable lives of the Missouri aristocracy and
how the depredations of raiding Jayhawkers from Kansas drove
Missourians like Jake to join outlawed Bushwhacker bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio was anxious that people get a political explanation
up front of where these characters are coming from,'' Schamus said.
``But we found out in our research screenings that the more we
tried to explain the political situation, the less satisfying the
film was to the viewer. So we took a lot of that out. As it is,
people naturally tend to experience this as an ideological film
depending on where they're coming from, on whether they tend to
side with the North or the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of the American empire
</P>
<P>
   At director Lee's urging, Schamus did create from whole cloth a
long monologue that reflects one of the film's underlying themes.
Lee, a native of Taiwan, had long observed with fascination _ and
some dismay _ that American culture and ideas have colonized much
of Earth, and he believes that the Civil War marked the beginning
of this ``Yankee-ization'' of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to find a way to articulate these things that were on
Ang's mind,'' Schamus noted.
</P>
<P>
   His answer was to put them in the mouth of Evans, a gentleman
farmer on whose land the guerrillas hide out during the winter. One
night in his parlor over brandy, Evans reluctantly admits that the
South cannot possibly win because the Yankees, with their notions
of public education and indifference to class, won't be satisfied
until everyone everywhere thinks just like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I figured that dialogue would end up on
the cutting room floor,'' Schamus admitted. ``But people respond to
that. It seems to have hit a nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the inevitable tinkering that takes place between the
printed page and the silver screen, Woodrell describes his
experiences with the filmmakers as overwhelmingly positive. At
various times throughout the production Schamus consulted with the
novelist and sent him drafts of the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gather from other novelists who have sold books to the
movies that this is not always the case,'' Woodrell said with dry
understatement. ``So my view of the process may not be typical.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Woodrell have any interest in writing for the screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the same way I'm interested in poetry,'' he said.
``I'm interested in film writing on a kind of fragmentary basis,
but I'll never devote myself to it. Writing novels has spoiled me.
I get to cast them, edit them and produce them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk about novelists getting involved in moviemaking, I
like to paraphrase Robert E. Lee,'' Woodrell said. ``It is a good
thing that moviemaking is so terrible, lest we grow to love it.''

JAPANESE `ANIME' DARES TO GO WHERE NO ANIMATION HAS GONE BEFORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pokemon'' may be the most successful Japanese cartoon to wash
onto American shores, but it's far from the only one. On Internet
sites such as animenation.com or in video catalogs, you can
purchase hundreds of video titles featuring .MDNM/``anime,'' as
Japanimation is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   But you may want to think twice before you let some of the most
popular anime films fall into the hands of your ``Pokemon''-loving
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, ``Ghost in the Shell,'' a violent action
movie that was dubbed into English into 1996 and has sold half a
million copies in the United States alone. Like many anime films,
``Ghost in the Shell'' takes place in a not-too-distant but barely
recognizable future. Humans are surgically altered to assume the
qualities of robots. These hybrids are then hooked up to the
Internet so the police can keep tabs on their brains. All is well
in this Big Brother fantasy until one day an evil virus hacks its
way onto the Net and starts erasing people's hard drives ... er,
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ``Ghost in the Shell'' hard to follow _ one of its
chief intrigues is that one never quite knows where a character's
human nature ends and robotic nature begins _ but there also are
frequent gun battles, female nudity and, in the opening minutes, a
graphic assassination scene.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't also several best-selling anime
titles appropriately aimed at children. In fact, anime has almost
as many different flavors as ``Pokemon'' has critters. In Japan,
where the average adult reads 200 comic books a year, anime _ which
grew out of Japanese comic book art _ has been a dominant force in
the culture for three generations, with something for every age and
interest. Think of anime almost as a medium rather than a genre and
you get a sense of its breadth and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Anime also is Japan's MTV, the one entertainment product it can
export seemingly everywhere. In the United States, where anime
videos began trickling onto the market 10 years ago, the genre is
finally starting to go mainstream:
</P>
<P>
   - Cable's Cartoon Network airs a ``Toonami'' anime block weekday
afternoons from 3 to 5, leading off with the half-hour series
``Sailor Moon,'' about a talking cat who turns a group of young
girls into high-kicking warriors for justice. Since last year
``Toonami'' has helped double Cartoon Network's afternoon audience
of 9-to-14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   - Disney's Miramax Films last month had the premiere of the
English-language version of ``Princess Mononoke,'' the
highest-grossing domestic film in Japanese history. Although it
tells a complicated story set in the Middle Ages, ``Princess
Mononoke'' captivated audiences with its lush scenery and its
unusually graceful motion, the result of 80,000 animation cels
drawn by its venerated creator, Hayao Miyazaki.
</P>
<P>
   - Other anime releases are making their way to theaters for
limited runs. The top distributor of anime in the United States,
Chicago-based Manga Entertainment, is showing ``Perfect Blue,'' a
thriller it expects to be as big as ``Ghost in the Shell,'' in more
than a dozen cities nationwide. (``Perfect Blue'' should arrive in
Kansas City this spring, according to Jerry Harrington, owner of
Tivoli Manor Square Theatre.)
</P>
<P>
   - Hundreds of anime clubs have sprung up in cities and on
university campuses across the United States, where members screen
new releases and swap videocassettes of old favorites. An anime
sales house, Right Stuf of Des Moines, Iowa, has a mailing list of
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   After `Astro Boy'
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that anime has come a long way from
``Astro Boy,'' the black-and-white Japanese import that was a
staple of Saturday mornings on American TV in the 1960s. ``Astro
Boy,'' created in 1952 by Osamu Tezuka, the father of anime, was a
crime-fighting machine _ literally. The story went that Astro Boy's
``father'' had built him to serve humanity after the man's own son
had died.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Astro Boy'' and other early cartoons, Tezuka borrowed
from the style of Walt Disney's characters, with their doe eyes and
pencil-line lips. Anime characters have never looked especially
Japanese, but their appearance is distinct to that country's
animation style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get asked: Why does their hair stand straight up? Why
do they all have such big eyes? Why do they all look like Speed
Racer?'' says Steve Pearl, who chairs the Anime Alliance, a network
of anime clubs in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them `the stupid questions.' The kids who are into
`Pokemon' _ they just accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anime's beginnings are found in the economic ashes of postwar
Japan. With little money to support a movie industry, the nation's
creative community instead began producing ``manga,''
cheap-to-print black-and-white comic books. A voracious public ate
them up, and by the 1960s the most popular manga were being turned
into movies. Today half of all movie tickets sold in Japan are for
anime features.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when videos began crossing over to the United States,
something was lost in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we would screen anime five, 10 years ago, we'd
hear that it looked different, that it was strange,'' recalls Mike
Lazzo, senior vice president for programming at cable's Cartoon
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was bad dubbing and animation that paled
next to the American product. But anime's soap-opera-like
continuity was also to blame. TV executives would hear complaints
from parents because ``Speed Racer'' _ another well-known '60s
import _ would leave stories hanging at the end of an episode.
American cartoons told a story (and sometimes two) in a tidy half
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Many anime serials are more complex than their American
counterparts, but that may not be the problem TV executives thought
it was. ``Pokemon,'' with more than 150 distinct characters, has
certainly caught on. Still, the ``Sailor Moon'' repeats seen in the
United States feature just five heroines, compared with 11 in the
Japanese version.
</P>
<P>
   Magical girls
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailor Moon'' is typical of the ``magical girls'' genre, as
it's known to anime aficionados. To a female viewer of a certain
age, the magical girls have endless appeal, as was evidenced this
summer at the Comic-Con in San Diego, the world's largest cartoon
and fantasy convention.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of preteen girls had coaxed their parents to bring them
down to the convention center and stand in line to see a
feature-length ``Sailor Moon'' film, a well-traveled 1993
production known on Web sites around the world as simply the ``S
Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead character in ``Sailor Moon'' is an irrepressible
14-year-old Kewpie doll whose path is crossed one day by a
mysterious black cat named Luna. (Why is she blond? ``It
differentiates her character,'' says Pearl.) The cat presents the
girl with a brooch that turns her into a leggy tyro in a miniskirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sailor Moon and her comrades (each named for a planet) eschew
traditional male weaponry, instead sending thunderous kinetic bolts
at their enemies. As the supergirls invoke their respective cosmic
forces, the girls in the audience scream their delight:
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon prism power, make up!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury star power, make up!''
</P>
<P>
   (Interestingly, the biggest cheers at this screening were for
the six heroines not seen in the American ``Sailor Moon.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, around the vast Comic-Con exhibit hall, anime was the
hottest thing going, with aisles of vendors selling videos,
paraphernalia, limited-edition cel art and other mementos covering
the whole range of anime. Hundreds of adoring kids showed up for
``Pokemon'' panels. Exhibitors ran out of prizes to give to people
who signed up for their anime clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to account for anime's grass-roots ascent, Cartoon
Network's Lazzo cites the recent success of professional wrestling.
Young boys now stay tuned for weeks to follow a storyline involving
their favorite wrestler. So why not a cartoon character?
</P>
<P>
   Lazzo adds: ``Another thing that complicates anime is that
sometimes a character will be good one week and bad the next week.
But that's something wrestlers do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Anime and professional wrestling also share a fascination with
buxom, scantily clad women _ big, blond timbers who aren't exactly
native to Japan _ and with violence. Unlike wrestling, some of the
best adult anime are meditations on the senseless and tribalistic
rite of killing, whether the primeval warfare between the forest
gods and humans in ``Princess Mononoke'' or the high-tech terrorism
of ``Ghost in the Shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's something intrinsically disturbing about the world's
finest animators applying their craft to ever-more exquisite ways
of depicting human bloodshed. Fangoria, a magazine specializing in
horror movies, recently ran stills from the critically acclaimed
``Perfect Blue,'' a movie about a pop star who is stalked by a
murderous fan. One of the images shows a homicide in a blood-rained
elevator, the victim's face so bloody as to make gender
identification impossible. Pornographic would not be too strong a
way to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that if there's one thing American mass culture
doesn't need more of, it's gratuitous bloodshed.

after conflicts over everything from the celebration's religious
theme to financing by an American fast-food chain _ remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   But come Dec. 31, just as Rio de Janeiro will have its
beachfront concerts and Edinburgh will have its thousand pipers _
one for every year of the millennium _ Britain will celebrate the
arrival of the millennium with the opening of the $1.2 billion
riverside cupola known as the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   At twice the size of Atlanta's massive Georgia Dome, the
Millennium Dome is designed to accommodate 35,000 people at a time
and will offer all sorts of highly publicized events beginning Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, London is planning its own New Year's celebration
dubbed Big Time. It will include a ``global village'' along the
banks of the Thames, with street fairs for both adults and children
that highlight the city's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames will
open Jan. 1, offering 25-mile views from 32 enclosed capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair has said it is logical that Britain _
which he proclaimed the ``home of time'' _ should host Europe's
largest millennium commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's Greenwich, southeast of London, that's home to
the prime meridian which gave the name to Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   This storied city's plans to ring in the new century has had its
share of skeptics, however.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing has embodied that skepticism more than the
Millennium Dome, designed to showcase Britain in the coming century
and dogged by controversy since its inception five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that such a huge number of architectural teams _
at least 15 _ were brought in to design the dome, making it
difficult to agree on any one plan.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling delays occurred. Worried sponsors pulled out. On at
least five occasions, plans for the dome were nearly ditched.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, press reports were often scathing.
</P>
<P>
   One, in 1998, said that dome organizers had persuaded media
magnate Rupert Murdoch's satellite television firm to divert $20
million of company money earmarked for investment in Britain's
schools into sponsorship of a carnival ride at the Greenwich site.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that McDonald's had announced its own investment of
$20 million in the project, sparking a national debate as to
whether the dome would really represent the ``Best of Britain'' as
promoters had previously claimed.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before The Evening Standard proclaimed it ``the
millennium fiasco.'' The Sun urged Britain to ``dump the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoters boasted that no taxpayer money was being used to build
the dome. The project has been financed with the proceeds of the
national lottery, as well as through private sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to make everyone happy all the time,''
said Fiona Cline, a spokeswoman for the New Millennium Experience
Co., which is running the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, The Faith Zone, one of the dome's 14 themed
pavilions, was renamed because its title was considered ``too
Christian'' and risked offending other religions.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be known as ``Faith Zone,'' with the definite
article removed, because ``the'' was thought to favor one faith,
Christianity, over others.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Frayling, who oversees the content of the zone, said
it's a very sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to offend anyone, but how can you make sure
absolutely everyone in the world is included in a project such as
this one?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, controversy has surrounded the role of Christianity in
the government's millennium celebration from the very beginning.
The name of the Faith Zone, for example, had already been changed
early this year from ``Spirit Zone'' after religious groups groused
that it sounded too vague.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under pressure from church leaders to acknowledge the
religious significance of the millennium, the dome organizers
agreed to allocate a sound-proofed room for prayer and meditation
for people of all beliefs. Organizers also agreed to allow the
Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to lead the nation in the
Lord's Prayer in the run up to the dome's official opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to turn the millennium into a secular event,
but we're not going to let that happen,'' said Colin Hart, the
director of the Christian Institute, which supports traditional
family values. ``People have tried to water down every element of
Christianity that can be found in the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such quibbling, much of the criticism and skepticism
surrounding the dome has now been replaced by anticipation, just
weeks before the dome's gala inauguration by Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   The mood began turning around last September, when dome
organizers were able to sell all 2,000 tickets for opening day
within hours, confounding critics who said no one would ever visit
the structure. It wasn't long before the dome was saturated with
corporate logos representing many of Britain's most-important
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now promoters predict that some 12 million people will visit the
dome during the year 2000, even though the price of an all-day,
adult ticket is a hefty US$32.50.
</P>
<P>
   And they've given the public a clearer idea of what visitors
will find under the dome's 20-acre roof.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will play virtual reality games allowing them to
explore everything from a woman's womb to the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Faith, the names of other themed pavilions at the
dome will include Play, Money, and Self-Portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In the Body Zone, for example, visitors will explore a
12-foot-high heart, complete with lots of blood and pumping veins.
Promoters claim the exhibit's so realistic that it's not being
recommended for young children. Another room within the Body Zone
explores the nature of beauty, and will allow visitors to adjust
the faces of celebrities using interactive video terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The dome will also house 16 bars, the two biggest cinema screens
in Britain, and Europe's largest McDonald's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So these days, much to the cynics' surprise, it appears the dome
could become a lasting, popular tribute to the millennium, as the
government originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like London will be the center of the world on New
Year's Eve, and I'm very excited about ... the dome,'' said Allison
Humphry, who plans to visit the dome in early January. ``I wouldn't
miss seeing such an important monument.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM BOX:
</P>
<P>
   London plans massive celebrations to ring in the new millennium.
And cities across the United Kingdom, including Liverpool,
Manchester and Nottingham, are hosting a variety of concerts, light
shows, and fireworks displays. Here are just a few of the events
planned in London to mark the new year:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The banks of the Thames will be transformed into a giant
``street party,'' with an Elizabethan fair and a huge carnival for
children complete with carousels and other rides. The action starts
at about 11 a.m. on New Year's Eve, leading up to a massive
fireworks display at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The London Eye, a new 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames that
promises 25-mile views over the city from 32 enclosed capsules,
takes its first passengers on New Year's Eve, but then closes again
until mid-January so that a ticket office can be built. The ride
will cost US$12 per adult and US$7.50 per child.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Millennium Dome, which includes 14 themed pavilions with
titles like Journey, Faith, and Body, will open Jan. 1. Tickets are
sold out for Jan. 1, but there are some tickets still available the
first week of January. An adult ticket sells for US$32.50. Call
(44-870) 606-2000 to buy tickets and for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another popular spot will be the Royal Observatory in
Greenwich, just southeast of London, home of the Prime Meridian,
which marks Greenwich Mean Time _ or ground zero of world time. The
observatory can be found in Greenwich Royal Park near the Maze Hill
rail station. It is closed Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Call (44-181)
858-4422 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Near the observatory, at the Queen's House, is a millennium
exhibit called ``The Story of Time.'' The exhibit, which runs
through Sept. 24, attempts to explain the meaning of time using an
array of props, everything from the art of Salvador Dali to the
earliest known dated watch. Call (44-181) 312-6565 for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  St. Martin-in-the-Fields at Trafalgar Square is hosting a
Millennium Day Extravaganza concert at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 1
featuring the works of Bach, Mozart, and Vivaldi. Tickets go for
US$13 to US$35. Call (44-171) 839-8362 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Harrod's, London's most famous department store _ visited by
30,000 customers a day _ is spruced up for the holidays, and is
selling everything from millennium coffees to millennium diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hampton Court Palace, southwest of London and one of England's
finest royal abodes, hosts holiday activities from Dec. 27 through
Jan. 3 (closed Jan. 1). They include music, dancing, and cooking in
Tudor kitchens. An adult ticket sells for US$15. Call (44-181)
781-9540 for more information.

   LONDON _ It's 11:59 p.m. on New Year's Eve. Spotlights
illuminate the four faces of Big Ben. Pulsating at one beat a
second, the spotlights count down the end of 1999. Finally, the
clock strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several barges unleash 200-foot flares, which sweep down the
Thames, creating what appears to be a long river of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds of pitch-dark calm are then followed by a 15-minute
fireworks display, one of the largest in the city's history.
</P>
<P>

go home, duly awed and amazed.

article removed, because ``the'' was thought to favor one faith,
Christianity, over others.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Frayling, who oversees the content of the zone, said
it's a very sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to offend anyone, but how can you make sure
absolutely everyone in the world is included in a project such as
this one?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, controversy has surrounded the role of Christianity in
the government's millennium celebration from the very beginning.
The name of the Faith Zone, for example, had already been changed
early this year from ``Spirit Zone'' after religious groups groused
that it sounded too vague.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under pressure from church leaders to acknowledge the
religious significance of the millennium, the dome organizers
agreed to allocate a sound-proofed room for prayer and meditation
for people of all beliefs. Organizers also agreed to allow the
Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to lead the nation in the
Lord's Prayer in the run up to the dome's official opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to turn the millennium into a secular event,
but we're not going to let that happen,'' said Colin Hart, the
director of the Christian Institute, which supports traditional
family values. ``People have tried to water down every element of
Christianity that can be found in the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such quibbling, much of the criticism and skepticism
surrounding the dome has now been replaced by anticipation, just
weeks before the dome's gala inauguration by Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   The mood began turning around last September, when dome
organizers were able to sell all 2,000 tickets for opening day
within hours, confounding critics who said no one would ever visit
the structure. It wasn't long before the dome was saturated with
corporate logos representing many of Britain's most-important
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now promoters predict that some 12 million people will visit the
dome during the year 2000, even though the price of an all-day,
adult ticket is a hefty US$32.50.
</P>
<P>
   And they've given the public a clearer idea of what visitors
will find under the dome's 20-acre roof.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will play virtual reality games allowing them to
explore everything from a woman's womb to the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Faith, the names of other themed pavilions at the
dome will include Play, Money, and Self-Portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In the Body Zone, for example, visitors will explore a
12-foot-high heart, complete with lots of blood and pumping veins.
Promoters claim the exhibit's so realistic that it's not being
recommended for young children. Another room within the Body Zone
explores the nature of beauty, and will allow visitors to adjust
the faces of celebrities using interactive video terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The dome will also house 16 bars, the two biggest cinema screens
in Britain, and Europe's largest McDonald's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So these days, much to the cynics' surprise, it appears the dome
could become a lasting, popular tribute to the millennium, as the
government originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like London will be the center of the world on New
Year's Eve, and I'm very excited about ... the dome,'' said Allison
Humphry, who plans to visit the dome in early January. ``I wouldn't
miss seeing such an important monument.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM BOX:
</P>
<P>
   London plans massive celebrations to ring in the new millennium.
And cities across the United Kingdom, including Liverpool,
Manchester and Nottingham, are hosting a variety of concerts, light
shows, and fireworks displays. Here are just a few of the events
planned in London to mark the new year:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The banks of the Thames will be transformed into a giant
``street party,'' with an Elizabethan fair and a huge carnival for
children complete with carousels and other rides. The action starts
at about 11 a.m. on New Year's Eve, leading up to a massive
fireworks display at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The London Eye, a new 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames that
promises 25-mile views over the city from 32 enclosed capsules,
takes its first passengers on New Year's Eve, but then closes again
until mid-January so that a ticket office can be built. The ride
will cost US$12 per adult and US$7.50 per child.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Millennium Dome, which includes 14 themed pavilions with
titles like Journey, Faith, and Body, will open Jan. 1. Tickets are
sold out for Jan. 1, but there are some tickets still available the
first week of January. An adult ticket sells for US$32.50. Call
(44-870) 606-2000 to buy tickets and for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another popular spot will be the Royal Observatory in
Greenwich, just southeast of London, home of the Prime Meridian,
which marks Greenwich Mean Time _ or ground zero of world time. The
observatory can be found in Greenwich Royal Park near the Maze Hill
rail station. It is closed Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Call (44-181)
858-4422 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Near the observatory, at the Queen's House, is a millennium
exhibit called ``The Story of Time.'' The exhibit, which runs
through Sept. 24, attempts to explain the meaning of time using an
array of props, everything from the art of Salvador Dali to the
earliest known dated watch. Call (44-181) 312-6565 for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  St. Martin-in-the-Fields at Trafalgar Square is hosting a
Millennium Day Extravaganza concert at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 1
featuring the works of Bach, Mozart, and Vivaldi. Tickets go for
US$13 to US$35. Call (44-171) 839-8362 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Harrod's, London's most famous department store _ visited by
30,000 customers a day _ is spruced up for the holidays, and is
selling everything from millennium coffees to millennium diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hampton Court Palace, southwest of London and one of England's
finest royal abodes, hosts holiday activities from Dec. 27 through
Jan. 3 (closed Jan. 1). They include music, dancing, and cooking in
Tudor kitchens. An adult ticket sells for US$15. Call (44-181)
781-9540 for more information.

A PERFECT CHRISTMAS GIFT: NOT POKEMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For Christmas, many parents are buying Pokemon (pocket monsters)
trading cards. Focus on the Family reported in a review that
Pokemon is so hot that rationing has been necessary.
 &HT;    The motto of Pokemon is ''Gotta catch them all,'' which drives
the hunger for more cards, games and logo material.
 &HT;    It's a singularly inappropriate gift for Christmas. The ideal
gift is one that will draw a person closer to Jesus, whose birthday
is being celebrated.
 &HT;    Pokemon is a mythic world where people dwell with exotic
creatures, a few of which are familiar (foxes, turtles, fish).
Others are like nothing ever seen (fairies, sentient plants, living
rocks, ambulatory sludge) that are captured and trained to fight by
Pokemon ``trainers'' (kids) who pit their stables of creatures
against competitors for honor and ``trainer badges.''
 &HT;    ``The goal of all trainers is to capture each and every Pokemon
in existence and become a Pokemon master,'' writes Focus. It sees
the material as largely innocuous:
 &HT;    ''With the advent of Pokemon, fans have disconnected themselves
from electronic entertainment and run outside with cards and
sourcebooks in hand. Strategic thinking is encouraged. Winning a
game requires knowing the strengths and weaknesses of other Pokemon
and playing the correct cards against them. To know the strengths
and weaknesses, one must read various books and study the
Pokemon.''
 &HT;    Without money to buy scads of cards, kids ''tend to trade,
learning negotiation skills in the process.''
 &HT;    David Brown wrote a pamphlet, ''The Problem with Pokemon,'' that
notes various characters are described as ''headstrong, stubborn,
quibbling, self-centered, vindictive, obnoxious, hormonal, sexually
preoccupied, evil, thieving cross-dressing jerks (who are)
definitely not biblical role models.''
 &HT;    In fighting an enemy, one character ''spits out poison powder to
immobilize the enemy, and then finishes the enemy with a spray of
acid.''
 &HT;    Is this what kids should think about?
 &HT;    Scripture warns, ''whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever
is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
admirable -- if anything is admirable or praiseworthy -- think
about such things. (Phil. 4:8).
 &HT;    In that light, I asked Bob Waliszewski, who oversees Focus on
the Family's Youth Culture, what he would recommend instead.
 &HT;    First, he praised the Harry Potter books, all three of which are
at the top of The New York Times best-seller list. A Focus review
in ''Plugged In,'' reports, ''Young readers can relate to Harry: he
is the underdog hero who manages to triumph, and like so many
children today, he longs for a family who will truly love
him...Harry Potter contains powerful and valuable lessons about
love, courage and the ultimate victory of good over evil.
 &HT;    ``However, children who read the books will also be confronted
with two distinctly non-Christian worldviews: occultism and
secularism.''
 &HT;    Waliszewski added that ''I would prefer my kids read C.S.
Lewis's `Chronicles of Narnia.' What I loved about ''The Lion, the
Witch and the Wardrobe,'' is that C.S. Lewis is telling that when
Aslan has to die, and the magic of Narnia resurrects him to come
back and overpower the witch, he has painted a picture of Christ
and the Gospel. You won't find anything like that in Potter,
nothing of a biblical nature.''
 &HT;    If my children were young, I would buy either of two books by
William J. Bennett, ''The Book of Virtues,'' or ''The Moral
Compass.'' Both feature short readings to aid parents ''in the
time-honored task of the moral education of the young...the
training of heart and mind toward the good,'' as he puts it. ''The
purpose of this book is to show parents, teachers, students and
children what the virtues look like, what they are in practice, how
to recognize them and how they work.''
 &HT;    The first volume begins each chapter with readings for very
young children, with progressively more challenging material.
 &HT;    ''Compassion'' begins with a poem about being kind to the
''gentle robin,'' who, for the crumbs ''As his meat you throw
along/ He'll repay you with a song.''
 &HT;    Some 35 pages later is a three-page portrait of ''The Angel of
the Battlefield,'' Clara Barton, who bravely went on Civil War
battlefields to tend to the wounded. After the war she organized
the American Red Cross, to help anyone hurt by earthquakes, forest
fires, epidemics.
 &HT;    ''The Red Cross would stretch out a hand of help to all such
victims, no matter where such disasters befall,'' she said.
 &HT;    Buying a Bennett book and reading such a story to your child is
the perfect Christmas gift.

DON'T BLAME LIFE'S NORMAL GLITCHES ON Y2K PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 12) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If your bank's ATM machine isn't working New Year's
Day, don't assume the high-tech cash machine has been hit by the
Y2K computer jinx.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, recall this aggravating statistic: Up to 3,000 of the
227,000 ATMs in the United States are broken at any given time
under normal circumstances, according to the American Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The machines go down when they run out of money or are being
serviced by bank personnel or suffer routine computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2k bug may cause computers to misinterpret the digits
``00'' as 1900, throwing a wicked curve ball at computer systems
that rely on dates. The threat to such computer-based sectors of
American society as electrical power, the air traffic control
system and financial institutions has led to intense efforts by
businesses and governments to cure this problem before the calendar
turns at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why some in the Y2K computer business are just
a bit defensive when they point out that any glitches in the New
Year might not be linked to Y2K but, instead, just part of life's
normal hassles.
</P>
<P>
   Take the electric power-grid for example. It's a near certainty
that at least several hundred people will be with electricity on
Jan. 1. For example, Northern States Power _ an upper Midwest
electricity supplier _ reports that an average of 75 customers lose
power every day among its 1.4 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen for a variety of reasons like a tree branch
falling on a power line or a vehicle crashing into, and damaging,
an electric utility pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failures may not be Y2K related at all,'' said John
Koskinen, the federal government's Y2K czar. ``As we all know,
things don't work everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he'll be the one on the political hotseat over New
Years' weekend, dealing with complaints about any Y2K-related
problems, Koskinen is trying to find out what usually doesn't work
so he will be able to decide whether any problems are worse than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know what the normal background noise is on a
normal weekend,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some late 20th century technology isn't vulnerable to a
Y2K-failure. For example, machines like cars and vending machines
do not contain computer chips that are date dependent. The same is
true for microwaves, refrigerators, ovens, coffeemakers and washers
and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   If any of these home appliances fail on Jan. 1, it's just
coincidence and has nothing to do with the date on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets tricky when it comes to things like ATM machines,
the air traffic control system and the electric-power grid that are
run by computers with date-dependent chips.
</P>
<P>
   These sectors have upgraded and tested their computers and
expect few, if any, Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're on an airliner on Jan. 1 and your flight is
delayed, just remember that up to 500 flights are delayed on a
daily basis, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The
FAA points out that with more than 55,000 daily landings and
takeoffs, delays amount to less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially thousands of planes could be delayed on New Years'
weekend if a winter snow or ice storm hits and a similar amount of
people could lose their electricity.
</P>
<P>
   So along with monitoring potential Y2K glitches, Koskinen will
likely keep an eye on the skies to see if any of the blame can be
placed on Mother Nature.

SHOPPING LIST: THESE BUSINESS BOOKS WERE THE BEST OF 1999
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy holidays! If you are a frenzied shopper looking for ideas,
here is my list of the best business books I read in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For a great management book, take a look at ``First, Break All
The Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 271 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman are employed by
the well-known pollsters, the Gallup Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The heart and soul of this book is based on two sizable Gallup
studies conducted over 25 years. The first asked 1 million
employees what they wanted most out of their company; the second
asked 80,000 managers, identified as talented by performance
measures within their companies, how they manage. Both questions
sought to pinpoint gray areas that hundreds of management books
have attempted to define.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: ``We had discovered that the manager _ not pay,
benefits, perks or a charismatic corporate leader _ was the
critical player in building a strong workplace,'' they write. ``The
manager was the key. ... People leave managers, not companies.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know about zentrepreneurism, beehiving or the
massive immigration of the 1980s, then you better get ``The Future
Ain't What It Used to Be: The 40 Cultural Trends Transforming Your
Job, Your Life, Your World'' (Burkley Publishing Group, 270 pages,
$14.95).
</P>
<P>
   It's written by a group of Minneapolis marketers called
Iconoculture. Their focus is popular culture _ specifically,
American _ and their methodology involves cross-country travel by
car, travel on the Web, reading everything in sight and
``relentless'' TV channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing this material, the group, which consists of Mary
Meehan, Larry Samuel and Vickie Abrahamson, get together to ``make
sense out of the cultural chaos, make key connections, and discuss
the implications for individuals and marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These forty cultural trends are literal signs of the times,
guideposts that point the way for you to proactively manage your
future,'' Iconoculture writes. ``Think of signs as territories to
stake with your career, business or brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the work force is made up of a mix of generations. How
best to manage that mix is discussed in ``Generations At Work:
Managing the Clash of Veterans, Boomers, Xers, and Nexters in Your
Workplace'' (AMACOM, 280 pages, $) by workplace consultants Ron
Zemke, Claire Rains and Bob Filipczak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no previous time in our history have so many and such
different generations with such diversity been asked to work
together shoulder to shoulder, side by side, cubicle to cubicle,''
they write.
</P>
<P>
   Given the distinct upbringing and value system of each
generation, this meeting of minds is causing yet another area of
conflict in the workplace, but also the chance to bring even
greater creativity, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   Is Scrooge alive in a Santa suit? Many Americans are overworked,
caught up in a corporate mentality of parties, retreats and other
so-called benefits that encourage longer days at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Arnott, a Dallas Baptist University management professor
and lecturer, sees it pushing us off the edge _ if we aren't
careful. He voices his views in his book, ``Corporate Cults: The
Insidious Lure of the All-Consumer Organization'' (AMACOM, 240
pages, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every organization has some degree of cultedness. People join
organizations to accomplish things that they cannot do on their
own, so individuals subordinate themselves to some extent,'' he
writes. ``However, in corporate cults, the organization has become
work, family, and community for the employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Many corporations are pushing their culture to the extreme,
seeing productivity rise with every after-hours party or employee
retreat, Arnott writes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, Arnott believes that the companies most
applauded for treating employees well may be the ones hurting their
individual employees' balanced lives the most.
</P>
<P>
   This book will show you how to evaluate your organization and
what to do about signs of danger to your psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, we'll look at some of the best books the economists
put forth in 1999.

   ``The Professional's Guide to Fitness''
</P>
<P>
   By Lawrence D. Schartz
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Publishing, $12.95
</P>
<P>
   Energy is the one thing nearly everybody would like more of, and
Dallas personal trainer and nutritional adviser Lawrence D. Schartz
has a plan to give it to the pencil-pushers. He encourages readers
to think of the book as a personal coach and tailors much of it to
a professional's busy lifestyle. Schartz says he travels 200 days a
year and still remains in great shape. His guide covers exercise,
nutrition and habits in an inspiring format.

   ``The Power of Positive Criticism''
</P>
<P>
   By Hendrie Weisinger
</P>
<P>
   Amacom, $15
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's a critic, especially at work, and although we like to
point out problems in other's presentations, reports or solutions,
few of us like to hear about our shortcomings. Hendrie Weisinger
has spent more than 20 years studying criticism and offers numerous
insights into how to do it effectively without destroying egos. His
tips are helpful for those giving and those taking criticism.

   ``Escape From Voice Mail Hell''
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Lebon
</P>
<P>
   Parleau Publishing, $17.95
</P>
<P>
   In 70 pages, Dallas author and productivity consultant Paul
Lebon shows how voice mail can be your friend, not your enemy.
Although e-commerce may be the future, Lebon says that
``v-commerce,'' or voice commerce, is still a major part of our
infrastructure. Lebon offers Ten Commandments on how to reach voice
mail subscribers effectively.

TIPS FOR SURVIVING POSSIBLE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 12.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts on possible Year 2000 computer problems say banks,
electricity distributors and transportation companies are ready for
the New Year. But they offer these tips just in case there are a
few Y2K computer failures:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a three-day supply of food and water, just as you would
be urged to have in preparation for a winter storm. Begin stocking
up now _ don't wait until Dec. 31 because stores may temporarily
run out of items like bottled-water.
</P>
<P>
   _Refill prescription medicines when you still have a five- to
seven-day supply remaining.
</P>
<P>
   _Have a flashlight, batteries, a battery-powered radio, a
first-aid kit and extra blankets and clothes for warmth.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep automobile gas tanks more than half full, a normal
recommendation for motorists in cold winter climes.
</P>
<P>
   _Check with manufacturers to see if such electronic equipment as
programmable thermostats and personal computers are Y2K ready.
Appliances like ovens, stoves, refrigerators, television sets and
smoke detectors do not contain date-based computer chips and should
continue to operate normally in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep paper copies of bank statements, credit card receipts,
bills and prescription medicine information, beginning now and
continuing for a few months after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _Withdraw only as much cash as you normally would for any
holiday weekend. Withdrawing large amounts of cash may invite
theft.
</P>
<P>
   _Beware of Y2K scams such as someone trying to sell Y2K
insurance or a Y2K-safe investment.
</P>
<P>

the Internet at www.y2k.gov or by calling 1-888-USA-4-Y2K.

`DEUCE BIGALOW, MALE GIGOLO': FISH-TANK CLEANER IN NEW LINE OF
WORK

   Little sex and less humor await audiences for ``Deuce Bigalow:
Male Gigolo,'' whose juvenile comedy targets a gallery of imperfect
women. These include an obese black, a narcoleptic, a victim of
Tourette's syndrome and a giant with a runaway pituitary gland.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes a woman with an artificial leg, her
sightless roommate and a clerk in a pet fish store who can be
induced to unwittingly wet her T-shirt while scooping snails from a
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Among the males are a stereotypical black pimp and a cuckolded
police detective given to exposing himself while he rails about the
imperfection of his sex organ.
</P>
<P>
   And given that the protagonist of this film is a fish-tank
cleaner and rescuer of goldfish from toilets, the term bathroom
humor is appropriate, especially since his father is a men's room
attendant.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' whose title
seems intended to evoke memories of ``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective,''
is not its low humor. Low humor has a proud history. The problem
with ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' directed by Mike Mitchell from
a screenplay by Harris Goldberg and Rob Schneider, is the low level
of its low humor.
</P>
<P>
   The high concept behind this tiny achievement is that Deuce,
played by Schneider, is asked to house-sit for Antoine Laconte
(Oded Fehr), a gigolo who must leave the country on high-priced
business while a valuable fish in his expensive aquarium in his
lavish home is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Leconte gives Deuce two pieces of advice: don't answer the phone
and don't drive the Porsche. Not much time passes before Deuce
violates the rules, because he has managed to destroy the fish tank
and set fire to the premises.
</P>
<P>
   So Deuce decides to try life as a gigolo to earn money to
restore the damage to Leconte's home. And soon he has attracted a
hungry, sloppy, fast-talking pimp, T.J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin), and
the attentions of the angry detective, Chuck Fowler (William
Forsythe), who wants to build a case against Leconte. T.J. also has
some advice for Deuce: don't fall in love with a client.
</P>
<P>
   As Deuce works his way through an assortment of women, learning
that compassion, not sex, is what many need, he eventually meets
the innocent Kate (Arija Bareikis), whose friends have arranged for
his services. And true love begins to run its troubled course.
</P>
<P>
   Among devotees of comedy, ``Deuce Bigalow'' is for the
undemanding.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' is rated R (under 17
requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes
simulated sex, foreplay, partial nudity, sexual innuendo, harsh
language and violence.

`CHERRY': DATING GAME: ONE'S A CLOWN

   ``Cherry,'' produced and directed by Joseph Pierson and Jon
Glascoe, is a romantic comedy in which a supermodel, Shalom Harlow,
plays a faux naive 29-year-old virgin, attracting suitors who
include a bashful gynecologist and a clown.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic as that sounds, this modest, easygoing date movie has its
charms. Not least of them are good humor and the refreshing absence
of any misanthropic edge. The film's obvious affection for its
characters makes up for its case of the cutes.
</P>
<P>
   Doe-eyed and wispy, beautiful Ms. Harlow (who also had a role in
``In and Out'') is the riskiest casting choice here. She girlishly
occupies every scene in the movie and even turns up for some in
pigtails and a wool hat.
</P>
<P>
   But she is supplied with deadpan dialogue by Terry Reed's
screenplay and surrounded by a solid group of supporting actors,
among them Isaach de Bankole (who can bring winking panache to any
comedy), Heather Matarazzo and Jake Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Weber is sweetly appealing in the film's dreamboat role, despite
the gynecological humor that comes with him. (See title. It's not
the heroine's name.)
</P>
<P>
   Parading in costumes that are painful even by clown standards,
Donovan Leitch is considerably harder to take.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Gil Rogers and David McCallum as the gay couple
who are surrogate parents to the heroine and her sister (Laurel
Holloman).
</P>
<P>
   Although the sight of McCallum in a World's Best Mom apron is
not the best advertisement for the film's humor, somehow ``Cherry''
winds up funnier and more warmhearted than it had any reason to be.

`CRUX': THE PROSAIC CORRESPONDENCE OF JAMES DICKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(js) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the acerbic letters in this collection, James Dickey
compares New York poets to ``crabs in a bucket: scrambling over
each other, pulling each other down, backbiting, calling each other
names, faulting each other's politics and so on.'' It has ``nothing
whatever,'' he complains, ``to do with poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader of ``Crux,'' Dickey is as guilty in
these pages of backbiting, score settling and disingenuous flattery
as the Yankee poets he knocks. Although there are a handful of
passages in this volume that help illuminate Dickey's own work and
attest to his love of books, a distressingly large portion is
devoted to poetic politics: to snide put-downs of other poets,
insider talk about prizes and fellowships, and catty remarks about
rival cliques and claques.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief introduction Matthew J. Bruccoli writes that the
rationale behind the selection of letters was ``to document the
growth of a major writer'' and ``the ways he fulfilled his genius
and advanced his career.'' ``The decision to focus on the
development of Jim's career obviated the life-in-letters
biographical approach,'' he adds. ``These letters do not provide a
systematic biography of James Dickey in his own words. His conduct
as husband and father is only indirectly revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an understatement to say the least. The attenuated
footnotes provided by Bruccoli and Judith S. Baughman not only
appear, awkwardly, at the book's end, where they are not easily
accessible, but they are also perfunctory in the extreme. Dickey's
well-known penchant for telling tall tales is checked only by fuzzy
and unhelpful notations like ``JD often exaggerated his military
record.''
</P>
<P>
   The editors do nothing to illuminate Dickey's ongoing
differences with the poets Robert Bly and Allen Ginsberg, and they
provide little or no context for many of Dickey's more startling
and cryptic statements. Like: ``The main thing that we're faced
with now is my wife's legal situation. If I were to tell you the
full consequences of what is embroiled in her case with various
allegations in different states, it would take a Clarence Darrow to
figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier portions of this book, devoted to Dickey's stint
in the Army Air Corps, his service in World War II, his postwar
education at Vanderbilt University and his stumbling efforts to
become a poet while moonlighting as an ad man, the reader is at
least treated to the drama of a young man discovering his vocation
as a writer: his voracious consumption of books, his eager
apprenticeship and his developing sense of philosophy and craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' he writes to the poet James Merrill, ``I
have been trying to do two things in poetry, both of which I have
been told one should not do. The first is to get away, by whatever
means, from the idea of a poem as objet d'art, which is a notion I
have always hated, however much it has been drilled into me. The
other is to be able to make statements, one after the other: this
happens, this happens, then this happens. To go with all this, I
have also been trying to assert connections in nature where none
exists: to make the world do what I say, rather than what it
actually does.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey grew up, he claims, ``in a family in which there was
simply no interest other than in sports,'' and he ``had no more
`talent' for writing poetry, in the beginning, than did Joe
Louis.'' The encouragement he received from the poet and teacher
Andrew Lytle, he writes, made him feel ``like a man who has been
sitting for some time, numbly'' in a cold place, and who then looks
up to see ``that someone has put a table in front of him, and a jug
of milk on that, and bread.'' In later years, when he had long been
a poet and teacher himself, Dickey would often choose to emphasize
his early life as a jock and underscore, like Hemingway, his love
of hunting and the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   As these letters make clear, however, Dickey was thoroughly a
creature, a self-promoting creature, of the literary world. The
bulk of letters in this volume show him shamelessly cultivating
prospective supporters and dissing gifted rivals. In many instances
he writes savage put-downs of a poet or critic to one
correspondent, then flatters that same poet or critic in a fan
letter.
</P>
<P>
   He denounces Edmund Wilson as ``a tiresome kind of old literary
hack,'' then writes Wilson a letter praising his work. He refers to
John Hollander as ``a literary pimp and time-server,'' then writes
Hollander that ``history is going to have it your way, rather than
the way of the nit-pickers who balk at your poems.'' He assails
Anne Sexton's poems for their ``clever, supercilious'' language and
``parading of mental illness,'' then tells her that she has
``touched a new tenderness in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is dismissed as ``that chocolate-frosting of a poet,''
W.S. Merwin as ``a prettified interior decorator with no subject''
and James Wright as that ``withdrawn, intellectual, ego-guarding,
semi-precious type that one normally associates with the term
`American poet.''' As for Robert Lowell, Dickey acknowledges that
he ``is good,'' but snidely adds that ``his world is so
over-violent it often seems either comical or as though the
violence were just being manufactured, and used here, there, and
everywhere'' _ a curious complaint, given the frequent eruptions of
violence in Dickey's own poems and novels like ``Deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   So what poets does Dickey like? He has a few good things to say
for Dylan Thomas (``He is very nearly a great lyric poet''),
Theodore Roethke (``He deals with eternal objects and eternal
feeling, and does not throw the sop of temporality or
headline-mongering at the audience'') and Archibald MacLeish (``He
is one of the few American poets to have a sound of his own'').
</P>
<P>
   Of course the poet Dickey likes the best is himself. He ranks
himself as one of the 10 best, along with the likes of Auden and
Pound, and he compares Esquire magazine's rejection of one of his
poems to a rejection of T.S. Eliot's ``The Waste Land.'' ``Humility
is not my forte,'' Dickey writes in one of the more honest passages
in this volume. ``I much more easily run to arrogance and
insolence.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader can only wonder why the editors of this volume would
want to ratify that observation at tiresome length with their
numbing, poorly annotated and repetitious selection of letters,
letters that cast a dark and noxious shadow over the very real
accomplishments of Dickey's career.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN M. TEMPLETON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. Templeton Foundation Press &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Distributed by N.Y. Times Special Features &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as we start out in adult life, we may not feel like
much of a success. Our society frequently defines success as the
material goods and lifestyle secured by large amounts of money
earned over a long period of time. We tend to think success is
something that occurs only later in life.
</P>
<P>
   However, this belief may impede us from achieving success even
then. Success takes practice, and successful people start
practicing when they are young!
</P>
<P>
   Think about it for a moment. A musician must practice diligently
to become a virtuoso. A medical doctor studies for many years and
interns for an additional period of time prior to beginning a
viable practice. An athlete trains long hours before becoming a
star.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it takes practice to experience success in life. If
you want to feel like a success, it is important for you to begin
to acknowledge your successes right now.
</P>
<P>
   Many times the things at which we're naturally gifted are the
hardest for us to claim as a success. We may make statements like,
``If I can do it so easily, why can't everyone else? If I can do
it, it can't be that hard!''
</P>
<P>
   It's important to listen to the acknowledgment we receive from
parents, teachers, employers and friends. Don't brush it off as if
they're just being nice. They may be telling you, ``You are a
success right now!''
</P>
<P>
   Answer with a sincere ``Thank you.'' There is no need to say
anything else. Making disparaging remarks about yourself or your
performance can be false modesty and negates the compliment that
was given to you.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, when a compliment is delivered with some
criticism, you may be tempted to give up. You may feel that since
nothing you do is good enough, why bother to try. Don't give in to
those feelings. Many people, especially your family, may have a
difficult time making it clear that they appreciate your talent and
are supportively behind you. Although they may want you to develop
your skill to the best of your ability, it might be difficult for
them to express this feeling in words.
</P>
<P>
   And if they take time to point out your mistakes, they may be
really saying, ``I know you can do better that this. I care and I
want to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   We are often our own harshest critics, and we have a tendency to
hear only criticism from others and not their praise. It is
important to practice hearing both compliments and constructive
remarks from those who have good advice to offer. As you begin to
recognize and build on the success you're experiencing now, you may
discover that this is a feeling you can create again and again in
various aspects of your living.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever anyone says to you, ``Good work!'' think to yourself,
``Yes, it is good work. I am successful with this.'' A swelled head
is never helpful, of course, but to acknowledge your gifts is not
necessarily self-indulgent, especially if you recognize you
couldn't have achieved success without the support and guidance of
others--like parents, teachers, friends, and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   If they comment, ``Okay, but you might do better,'' realize you
may have more to give, and receive this advice with an open mind
and heart. Determine to do your best. You are the one who will
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A story is told about a little boy who called at a house selling
picture postcards for a quarter each. The man who answered his
knock asked the lad what he was going to do with the money he
earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said, ``I'm raising $100,000 for our new church
building.''
</P>
<P>
   The startled customer responded, ``Do you expect to raise it all
by yourself?'' The young man answered with a straight and serious
face, ``Oh, no, sir. There's another little boy helping me!'' This
young man had the spirit of success at an early age!
</P>
<P>
   Knowing right now--feeling inside right now--that you're
successful, whether you're a singer in the church choir, a waitress
in a restaurant, the coach of the softball team, or the budding
mechanic spending every spare moment in the garage rebuilding the
engine of that antique car, can prepare you for greater and greater
success.
</P>
<P>
   Success is not a one-time event. It can be an accumulated series
of wins and other experiences that create a successful life.

`THE WAR ZONE': IN A HOUSE FULL OF NUDITY, EMOTIONS ARE NAKED TOO
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(af) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most troubling events in ``The War Zone'' take place inside
a cement bunker, but that's not what gives the film its name. The
actual battlefield is the rural English home where a teenager named
Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) looks at his own family with helpless rage
and astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   His mother (Tilda Swinton) is hugely pregnant as the film
begins. Then she is preoccupied with the new baby and not eager to
notice much else. Tom's older sister, Jessie (Lara Belmont), is
sullen and uneasy, especially in the presence of their father (Ray
Winstone). And Tom already senses what he will eventually know for
sure: that sex between Dad and Jessie is a fact of this family's
life.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Tim Roth makes a fierce, disturbing directorial debut
with a film that treats incest as something worse than a terrible
secret. In this story, adapted by Alexander Stuart from his own
novel, the father-daughter relationship is almost a given.
</P>
<P>
   It arises fearsomely from the sexual tensions in the household,
which Roth underscores with many scenes in which the characters are
unself-consciously naked, unsettling one another. He need not
specify how explosive this atmosphere must be to a frustrated
adolescent who often tussles angrily with his beautiful sister.
</P>
<P>
   Raw as it is in spirit, ``The War Zone'' is filmed with cool
blue-green tones and spare, painterly precision. (Seamus McGarvey's
striking cinematography is mournfully expressive.) Similarly, the
minimal dialogue often gives way to bitter, smoldering silence.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gary Oldman's voluble ``Nil by Mouth,'' which also
starred Winstone as a frighteningly abusive father and had a
watchful, tormented boy as its protagonist, Roth's film treats the
pain in this household as literally unspeakable. So he favors
extreme understatement.
</P>
<P>
   One hauntingly effective shot finds Tom outside in the rain,
with green landscape occupying most of the frame and a band of
yellow light on its right-hand side. That light comes from a window
through which Tom can see his father and sister. Just a hint of
that image goes a monstrously long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Zone'' first startles its audience with a violent
automobile accident as the family is en route to the hospital,
waiting for the baby's birth. That event has a stark, surreal
quality that shows up in the rest of the story as well.
</P>
<P>
   The film concentrates on sexual currents to the dreamlike
exclusion of anything else in the characters' lives, to the point
where its most shocking events take place in a psychological
vacuum. For all its dramatic power, ``The War Zone'' leaves much
about its characters' urges and motives unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to imagine Roth himself playing a role as
passively and balefully as his leading man does here, he directs
the inexperienced Cunliffe to make the most of it. This young actor
is a powerfully disturbing presence. And Ms. Belmont, also an
acting newcomer, is no less hauntingly used. Her facial resemblance
to Ms. Swinton is artfully exacerbated, as is her carnal presence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swinton, in her small but crucial role, makes the mother far
more than an oblivious bystander. Winstone again proves himself an
extremely natural, courageous actor blessed or cursed with the
ability to bring heedless brutishness to life.

`DIAMONDS': KIRK DOUGLAS PLAYS A GUY WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leading with his famous chin, Kirk Douglas (who turned 83
Thursday), gleefully devours the scenery in ``Diamonds,'' a
simmered-in-schmaltz comedy about a grumpy older man determined not
to go gentle into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' character, Harry Agensky, a former welterweight boxing
champion once known as the Polish Prince, is really a pugilistic
stand-in for the star, who is shown slugging it out in the ring in
clips from his 1949 movie ``The Champion.''
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Harry, who is recovering from a stroke that
has left his speech impaired, he is vigorously practicing mouth
exercises to an instructional video in the Canadian home of Moses
(Kurt Fuller), his favorite of his two grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   By turns feisty, weepy and crazily reckless, Harry clings so
tenaciously to his own boxing legend that on occasion he still
likes to pick fights. And when he puts up his dukes, the years melt
away and he exhibits the stamina of a man 30 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   But such moments are fleeting, and a minute later Harry is just
as likely to crumple into a helpless weeping puddle of
disappointment and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds,'' directed by John Asher from a screenplay by Allan
Aaron Katz, is a made-to-order star vehicle that gives Douglas
unlimited rein to flex his acting muscles. And as this bulldog of
an actor struts and pumps and mugs his way through the film he
dominates, you have to admire him for not taking things way over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   The star's courageous performance is the main attraction of a
movie that shamelessly pours on the sentiment (Harry's favorite
song, ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?,'' is played at least two times
too many) while relating a rickety, far-fetched yarn.
</P>
<P>
   For all Harry's spurts of vigor, he has become a burden to his
family, which is gently nudging him toward a nursing home. But
Harry thinks he has the solution. For decades he has claimed that
he was once given 13 priceless diamonds by a mobster named Duff the
Muff for agreeing to throw a fight.
</P>
<P>
   All these years, he insists, the jewels have been hidden in the
mobster's Nevada home. The time has come to retrieve them. But do
they really exist? Only Harry's 15-year-old grandson, Michael
(Corbin Allred), believes his story.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows Harry; his less-favored, recently divorced
son, Lance (Dan Aykroyd); and Michael, Lance's son, on a wild and
wacky car trip from the Pacific Northwest to Reno to recover the
jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the travelers suffer predictable mishaps. Harry
insists on taking the wheel and nearly kills them. At the Canadian
border the old man creates such a fuss that the travelers are
ordered out of their vehicle and frisked.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Diamonds'' mechanically reels off standard variations on
the my-father-never-told-me-he-loved-me theme (a theme that has
sunk better movies than this one), the schmaltz comes to a boil.
The parallels between Harry's distance from Lance (a pudgy
fussbudget sportswriter who was never a jock like his father) and
Lance's sniping at his own mildly rebellious teen-age son (he
sneaks cigarettes) are just too pat for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds,'' which opens Friday in New York City, finally goes
haywire when it takes the three to a brothel where the girls all
have hearts of gold and endless ingenuity and insight. Here Lance
rediscovers the joys of sex, and Michael has his initiation from a
bombshell (Jenny McCarthy) who wistfully compares him to her
high-school boyfriend. Harry meets his soul mate in the
establishment's tough but tender madam, Sin-Dee (Lauren Bacall).
</P>
<P>
   But what about those diamonds? Do they exist? Let's put it this
way: the only thing about the movie that isn't a transparent paste
imitation is Douglas' hard, gleaming performance.

`THE CIDER HOUSE RULES': A RITE OF PASSAGE, WITH DICKENSIAN
SYMPATHIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't take a cryptographer to decipher the meanings in John
Irving's sprawling picaresque allegories. But a reader who wants to
savor them must be willing to suspend a psychoanalytic view of
human nature descended from Freud through Oprah and surrender to an
imagination that is more Dickensian than Freudian.
</P>
<P>
   Once you give up those expectations, a visit to the world
according to Irving is a little like touring a parallel universe
where fate is determined not so much by abusive parents as by
wondrous tragicomic events beyond the realm of psychology.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of a better filmmaker to guide us through that
world than Lasse Hallstrom, the director of ``My Life as a Dog''
and ``What's Eating Gilbert Grape?,'' two grown-up movies that
share Irving's adult-child sensibility. In Hallstrom's lovely
adaptation (with a screenplay by the author) of Irving's sixth
novel, ``The Cider House Rules,'' the author's fantastical world of
wonders and the director's tender-hearted compassion mesh into what
is easily the finest film realization of an Irving novel.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is really only a fragment of that novel, scaled down
to conventional movie length, with numerous characters discarded
and the story's time frame compressed from decades into a couple of
years. The novel's exhaustive examination of abortion (both its
moral and medical aspects) has been greatly softened.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is a gentle, beautifully acted fable about a young
man's journey into the world, his loss of innocence and his
acquiring of values that reflect the lessons learned on his
journey.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also a blatant homage to ``David Copperfield,''
brief passages of which are read aloud to the children in St.
Cloud's orphanage, the Maine institution where much of the story
takes place during the height of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is a sustained meditation on the dream of home sweet
home that gnaws at the heart of its orphaned main character Homer
Wells (Tobey Maguire) as well as the hearts of the other children
who grow up in St. Cloud's. Some of the movie's most touching
moments find the camera lingering over the faces of children
silently pleading with angelic smiles and saucer eyes to be
selected for adoption by couples who visit the institution in
search of the perfect child.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Homer grows up under the tutelage of the
good-hearted, tight-lipped Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the
orphanage's omnipotent doctor who delivers the babies of unwed
mothers and who also performs abortions on request. Although Homer
never attends medical school, by the time he leaves St. Cloud's he
knows both how to deliver and abort babies.
</P>
<P>
   One Dickensian message the movie hammers home is that growing up
means coming to the realization that in a cosmic sense we are all
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Larch is portrayed as a benign figure, the movie
wonders about the consequences of his life-and-death decisions and
his readiness to play God, and asks how anyone could presume to be
so omnipotent. By giving the doctor a tragic flaw in his addiction
to ether, it suggests that his need to escape facing full
responsibility for his hubris is what finally undoes him.
</P>
<P>
   But the film implies even more forcefully that in order for our
lives to mean anything at all, we sometimes have to play God, take
charge and do what we believe is right.
</P>
<P>
   When Homer is barely out of his teens, he leaves St. Cloud's to
explore the big, wide world in a red roadster driven by Wally
Worthington (Paul Rudd), a cocky young Army flyer whose beautiful
blond fiancee, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), has just had an
abortion at St. Cloud's. While Wally is away at war, Homer works as
an apple-picker on his father's farm, and he and Candy fall in
love.
</P>
<P>
   Homer also becomes involved in the lives of the migrant workers
who share a dormitory where the inane rules of conduct (the cider
house rules) are posted on the wall. And in the movie's dramatic
climax, he finds himself intervening in the tormented incestuous
relationship of a character simply named Rose (Delroy Lindo) and
his daughter Rose (the pop singer Erykah Badu) and eventually
having to play God. The consequences of this act of conscience,
however, are tragically ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' is an unabashedly sentimental movie
that wants to pluck our heart strings, and now and then its tone
(and its quiet but incessant soundtrack by Rachel Portman) turns
cloyingly sweet. But the performances have an understated gravity
and the screenplay a thematic consistency that largely avoid tawdry
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring the movie is Maguire's sober, wide-eyed Homer, a
wounded, moon-faced innocent who, in leaving the institution that
nurtured him, blindly follows his heart and finds fulfillment
working outdoors. Even in simple apple picking, Homer feels he is
obeying Larch's dictum (a recurrent theme in the movie) to ``be of
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine's portrayal of a Maine doctor (he has a perfect American
accent and clipped New England delivery) is a coup for an actor who
had seemed too often trapped in the roles of snake-eyed British
lotharios, con men and other sleazeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Lindo's apple picker is a towering human storm about to collapse
on itself, and Ms. Badu's desperately agitated Rose is one of the
year's sharpest screen acting debuts.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stapleton's cinematography drenches the movie in an
oak-gold '40s New England ambiance that is so intense you can
almost taste the sour-apple pungency of the orchard air. That
ambiance, along with the idealized romance of the gung-ho daredevil
flyer and his honey-blond sweetheart, gives the film a slightly
mythical quality that harmonizes with Irving's subtly literary
screenplay and the director's soft-hearted child's-eye vision.
</P>
<P>
   The need to be of use, the discovery that the official rules and
real-life rules of how to behave rarely coincide _ these and other
life lessons that our innocent hero learns may sound like the
tritest of homilies. But ``The Cider House Rules'' gives them the
depth and emotional weight of earned wisdom.

 &HT;    HIGH HOPES, ANXIETIES MEET SYRIAN-ISRAEL TALKS
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ For two decades, Syria has lead the Arab
opposition to Israel. But Thursday, Israeli law clerk Odelia Arad,
28, considered working the country into her lunch plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go have humus in Damascus,'' Arad said of the Syrian
capital about 130 miles away. ``They are right next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Her appetite for peace got a boost Wednesday when U.S. President
Bill Clinton announced that the two longtime enemies would resume
peace talks next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement surprised Israelis, whose opinion will be
crucial. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to hold an
unprecedented referendum on any deal that emerges from the talks.
Syrians, without a democracy, likely won't have that choice.
</P>
<P>
   But, throughout the region Thursday, Arabs and Israelis were
assessing the potentials and perils that could come.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria have been in an official state of war for
decades and have been down the peace-talks path before. The last
formal, and often acrimonious, talks broke off in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new talks, featuring Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Sharaa, could remove one of the great obstacles to peace in
the Middle East. They come amid Israel's parallel talks aimed at
reaching an agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a matter of months now. Not of years. The year 2000 is
going to be, hopefully, the year of peace,'' Israeli Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin said. ``Syria is now the key to comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has been arguably the most important hold-out among
Israel's neighbors. Egypt, the largest Arab country, made peace
with Israel in 1982. The Palestinians, though still embroiled in a
torturously slow peace process, officially recognized Israel in
1993. Jordan followed with a peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With about 15 million people and a history of regional
dominance, Syria has lead the so-called ``rejectionist'' front
among Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   For Syria and President Hafez Assad, peace with Israel could
bring a return of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in 1967.
Though Israel's ownership of the strategic plateau is not
recognized by most governments, it has populated the Golan with
18,000 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, 71, reportedly wants to reunite Syria before turning
power over to his son. He seeks U.S. aid to fortify an economy that
has suffered since the fall of its former sponsor, the old Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But, Assad has to hope that a deal with Israel, seen by Syrians
as an aggressive enemy, will pay off in land and prosperity. While
his people will have little say, Assad will likely want a deal good
enough to strengthen his son's chances for succession.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's official Tishrin newspaper Thursday stated the country,
``will not give up one iota of soil from the Golan. The occupation
must cease from all of the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper warned that Israel's ``intentions alone, regardless of
how good they appear, do not make a peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are also pondering the risks of peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear that giving up the Golan would allow Syria to use it,
as it did in the 1960s, to launch attacks from the high ground.
They are seeking promises that the Syrian army will not be allowed
back and international monitors will keep watch.
</P>
<P>
   The debate taps into Israelis' visceral wariness. Right-wing
Israeli politicians Thursday alleged that there has already been a
secret deal to give away the Golan. Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon
claimed that Barak had buckled under U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Another politician, Shaul Yahalom, called the move
``semi-suicide.'' Avi Zeira, leader of the Golan Residents
Committee said Barak ``has abandoned us like we are foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   But, a deal with Syria could further Israel's quest toward
normal diplomatic and economic relations with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Syria controls Lebanon and could reign in the Hezbollah
guerillas now fighting Israel there. That would help Barak fulfill
a campaign promise to withdraw from the unpopular 18-year war in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim el-Hoss said Thursday that his
country would enter the talks after the initial round, possibly
becoming the next Arab state in line to accept Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Israel concludes an agreement with the Syrians, the Arab
world will open up to Israel,'' said Syrian-born political
scientist Walid Kazziha, of the American University in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   As a Syrian native, he bristles at Israeli treatment of
Palestinians and other Arabs and said any peace will likely ``not
be a warm peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in our hearts, we know that we are making a settlement
because we are weaker,'' he said. ``It is necessary, but I'm not
going to go out and smile and say what a lovely situation it is.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say many of the issues between the two sides were
settled during the talks three years ago. Those agreements were
``deposited'' with American mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has reportedly agreed to have economic ties with Israel
and exchange ambassadors. The two sides have also likely agreed to
keep both their armies out of the Golan and allow some foreign
monitors there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to not agreeing on the extent of the Israeli Golan
withdrawal, they have not agreed on how long a withdrawal would
take. Israel wants it done over years while Syrian compliance is
watched. Syria wants it done within months.
</P>
<P>
   The have also not agreed on how to split up the Golan's water
supply, which both countries need badly.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hispanic groups launched a new Internet site
Thursday in an effort to swell the ranks of Latino voters to record
levels in next year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be a powerful force in the next election,''
said Daisy Exposito (cq.), incoming president of the Association of
Hispanic Advertising, one of the creative forces behind the new
Website.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.latinvote.org, is designed as a one-stop online
source for Hispanics who want to register to vote or are seeking
information about political issues and candidates at the local and
national levels.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors launched the site with a multi-media advertising
campaign on television and in newspapers with the theme: ``If you
don't select, somebody else will do it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the air support we have needed,'' said Juan Andrade
(cq.) , president of the United States Hispanic Leadership
Institute, and a veteran of door-to-door Latino voter registration
drives. ``This is the most collaborative effort ever ... to insure
that every Latino who is qualified to vote does,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The new Internet site reflects the growing political influence
of Hispanics, already the fastest growing ethnic group in the
United States. They number about 30 million, or 11 percent of the
total population. But by 2050, it is projected that one out of
every four Americans will be of Latino descent.
</P>
<P>
   In next year's election, Hispanics are likely to be a critical
swing vote in the presidential race because they are concentrated
in five states with a total of 166 electoral votes, more than half
of the 270 needed to be elected president. The states are
California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics will play ``a decisive role'' in the election,
predicted Fernando Espuelas (cq.), chairman of StarMedia Network,
an Internet firm that is the principle financial backer of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4.9 million Hispanics voted in the last
presidential election, a 16.3 percent increase over 1992. The
www.latinvote.org sponsors hope to turn out 7 million Latino voters
in the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Website is non-partisan, Andrade cited several
polarizing issues as critical reasons for the new site, including
affirmative action and bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that we have fought for are in danger,'' he said during
a news conference at the historic Hay-Adams Hotel near the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination, opposes affirmative action. And his
party's congressional leadership has been the leading political
force against bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush has warned his party against ignoring Latinos
next year. ``In order for our party to be relevant, we better
nominate somebody who understands the Hispanic vote and how to
achieve it,'' Bush said at a ``Politics &AMP; Eggs'' breakfast in
Beford, N.H., last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush speaks Spanish fluently. And in his reelection campaign in
Texas last year, he received nearly half of the state's Hispanic
vote, a remarkable achievement for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, Republican presidential candidates have received an
average of 28 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to a 1998
study by Andrade's organization. Ronald Reagan did best with Latino
voters, capturing 36 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, however, studies indicate that Democratic
presidential candidates have out-polled Republicans by as much as
three to one among Hispanic voters _ a key factor in the campaign
strategy of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner.

study by Andrade's organization. Ronald Reagan did best with Latino
voters, capturing 36 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, however, studies indicate that Democratic
presidential candidates have out-polled Republicans by as much as
three to one among Hispanic voters _ a key factor in the campaign
strategy of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner.

 `MISS JULIE': THE JOYLESSNESS OF SEX IN CLASS-RIVEN 1890s SWEDEN  
(EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmed with hand-held cameras that chase the characters around a
roomy 1890s-style Swedish kitchen, Mike Figgis' screen adaptation
of August Strindberg's drama ``Miss Julie'' would like to persuade
us that the forces driving its vicious sexual conflict are as
volcanic today as they were a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Strindberg's study of the embattled relationship between Miss
Julie (Saffron Burrows), the imperious, profoundly neurotic
daughter of a wealthy count, and Jean (Peter Mullan), the virile,
opportunistic footman whom she goads into a sexual liaison, casts
the coldest of eyes at unleashed human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In the play's frigid world of repressed aristocrats and randy
servants, a sensual upper-class woman's lifting the lid on her own
seething libido is tantamount to self-destruction. Although the
lower classes are free to rut as they please (in one scene, a group
of servant girls cavort around the kitchen singing lewd songs about
the sexual uses for garden vegetables), what keeps their appetites
in check are fear for their livelihoods and the bromide of
religion. Jean's sanctimonious fiancee, Christine (Maria Doyle
Kennedy), who works in the count's kitchen, fervently subscribes to
the notion that a rich man has about as good a chance of entering
the kingdom of heaven as a camel does of passing through the eye of
a needle.
</P>
<P>
   How then does the play's erotic ethos relate to today's sexually
commodified culture of Calvin Klein, Frederick's of Hollywood,
breast implants and Viagra? Distantly. The brutal power struggle
between Miss Julie and Jean and the kinds of abuse they hurl at one
another might be compared to a stormy affair between a rebellious
Park Avenue debutante and an aspiring gangsta rapper hoping to
seduce her into subsidizing his fledgling record company. But for
all the exploitative undercurrents that this theoretical '90s
coupling might involve, it is likely that they would at least be
enjoying some hot sex.
</P>
<P>
   The game played by Miss Julie and Jean is an emotionally
sadomasochistic ritual in which she humiliates him by issuing
commands and reminding him of his place as her servant, with the
implied threat that if he doesn't obey he will be dismissed. Jean
in turn reviles Miss Julie, whom he has worshiped almost as a
goddess, for a lack of self-control that makes her no better than a
beast. What both characters share is an unquestioned disgust for
the sexual act. For both, succumbing to lust is a dirty and
degrading surrender. And when they finally consummate their desire,
they do it standing up, fully clothed, in a hidden corner of the
kitchen, face to face, looking each other angrily in the eye and
all but denying the joyless, perfunctory intercourse taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The British director's close-up portrait of this encounter is
not surprising, given the erotic components of his previous film
``Internal Affairs'' and the more recent ``Loss of Sexual
Innocence.'' ``Loss,'' in spinning variations on the Adam and Eve
story, also emphasized the self-disgust of the world's first couple
after Eve tasted the apple. And its parallel contemporary vignettes
dwelled on the powder keg of sexual jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   This view of sex as an essentially dangerous, eruptive force is
amplified in the director's flagrantly unsensual interpretation of
``Miss Julie.'' The characters' attraction and revulsion are part
and parcel of a power struggle between social classes, and of
women's sexual oppression. (Some of Miss Julie's troubles are
ascribed to the fact that she had an unorthodox upbringing by a
father who treated her like a man.)
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the camera pulls away, the movie pointedly illustrates
the class differences between Miss Julie and Jean. Ms. Burrows, who
is tall and swanlike, literally towers over her servant, who is
stocky and several inches shorter. Jean worships Miss Julie less
for her beauty (Ms. Burroughs is a stunner) than for her
upper-class status and wealth and his dream of leeching onto it.
The chemistry of her hauteur and his blunt carnality strongly
recalls the menacing, eroticized class atmosphere that suffused
Joseph Losey's great film ``The Servant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burrows, who appeared in ``Loss of Sexual Innocence'' (and
was wasted in ``Deep Blue Sea''), imbues Miss Julie with a
smoldering resentment that suggests a more subdued Judy Davis (and
oh what a Miss Julie Ms. Davis could be!). If her performance is
consistent, it is far from riveting. Mullan's Jean may not fit
today's stereotype of a spoiled rich girl's working-class
dreamboat, but he radiates a magnetic mixture of earthiness and
cunning. Even in those moments when his fantasy of running away
with Miss Julie and having her set him up in business seems within
grasp, he remains grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Miss Julie'' was shot in sequence in less than three
weeks, it has some of the spontaneity of a filmed play. But the
film's many close-ups and the camera's swirls lend it an air of
hyper-realism that is contradicted by the schematic play (adapted
for the screen by Helen Cooper). The dialogue may be crisply
idiomatic, but there's finally nothing realistic about the speed
with which the characters hurtle through their mood swings and
power plays. The visual realism only underscores the fact that this
drama, so groundbreaking in its time, is an extremely (and
artificially) compacted case study of a frustrated woman flailing
against the social constraints of a much more repressive society
than the one we live in.

COMPANY OFFERS WAY TO ORGANIZE WEB BOOKMARKS

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Atop the kitschy Buca di Beppo Italian eatery,
the latest Web site craze is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on crumbs, as in leaving behind crumbs to find your
way back home through a forest. Except these are digital crumbs,
and the forest is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Backflip (www.backflip.com ) is a $4 million Internet start-up
company headed by a pair of veterans of Netscape Communications
Corp. The company is hoping Web users are sick of losing their way
while cruising the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution: Keep track of what a Web user visits, then index
that content, plus allow that user to search by keyword through
this worn path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backflip allows users to create their own personal Yahoo,''
said Backflip co-founder and chief executive Tim Hickman, a former
Netscape product manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets a user build their own search engine and index of the
content they've visited.''
</P>
<P>
   Backflip consists of several components. It creates a
personalized home base Web page that categorizes the pages a user
has visited. It also creates a searchable database of the content
of these pages.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Backflip puts a button on the Web browser that allows a
user to ``backflip'' pages that he or she wants to save. A browser,
such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator, is
software used to view Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Most browsers already come with a bookmarking feature that saves
the location address of Web pages, but the content of those
bookmarks is not searchable. A particularly enthusiastic bookmarker
can quickly create a confusing and cumbersome list of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more bookmarks you have, the more difficult it is to
use,'' Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Backflip's first investor was Ron Conway of Angel Investors LP,
a group of successful Internet moguls who have ponied up $125
million for Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm betting on the team and the idea,'' Conway said. ``It
solves a big problem for people by acting as their memory of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Backflip plans to generate revenue in part by what it calls a
suggestion engine. Hickman said the site would not actually track
or sell to third parties any individual's Web viewing habits
(thereby avoiding privacy concerns, he said).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, Backflip will track the Web sites and the
content users view. It will then go out and gather similar content
to suggest to users.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman said this suggestion process takes place within
Backflip's internal computers, disconnected from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers, Hickman said, will have their messages delivered
along with those suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong privacy assurances are going to make this work,''
Hickman said. ``And we have that.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ Is there a college building anywhere in the
United States that can match the storied past of Nassau Hall at
Princeton University, a history that goes well beyond the world of
academe? Built of local stone and capped with an impressive bell
tower, the building served as the college's centerpiece when it was
erected by Presbyterians in 1756.
</P>
<P>
   But in a remarkable seven-year span it twice served as a seat of
government (state and national) and figured in a Revolutionary War
battle. New Jersey's first Legislature gathered at Nassau Hall in
1776 and adopted the state seal. In 1783 Congress met there for
four months with James Madison, a former student, returning as a
representative from Virginia. To walk such historically rich ground
is reason enough to visit Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The newly arrived will find a pleasant, centrally located hotel
called the Nassau Inn, restaurants, a fine bookstore (Micawber
Books) and no shortage of shops on and around Nassau Street, the
main thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   The university lends Princeton an identity that sets it apart
from the commercial and suburban mass continually spreading out
across central New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald, an undergraduate here when the university's
13th president, Woodrow Wilson, was in the White House, snobbishly
described Princeton as ``rising, a green Phoenix, out of the
ugliest country in the world.'' Fitzgerald evoked Princeton in his
first novel, ``This Side of Paradise,'' which he had begun during
his student days here. It is a testament to Princeton's cultural
depth that Fitzgerald is only a single stone in the diadem of
luminaries who have crowned the town with glory, a roster that
includes political leaders, scientists and a breathtaking number of
literary figures, from the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Thomas Mann
to the literary critic Edmund Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein lived here. Two centuries earlier, so too did
Jonathan Edwards, the nation's greatest theologian and the
university's third president, who lies buried here along with his
notorious grandson, Aaron Burr, a Revolutionary War officer,
Jefferson's first vice president and the man who killed Alexander
Hamilton in a duel in 1804.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton can claim George Washington not only as visitor but
also as victor. The general's embattled colonial troops won an
important battle here on Jan. 3, 1777, nine days after they crossed
the Delaware, defeating King George's redcoats and providing a
much-need triumph for the beleaguered revolutionary cause in the
early days of the war. The victory was capped by the surrender of
British troops holed up in Nassau Hall. They succumbed to
Continental Artillery fire urged on by Hamilton, who had better
luck against the British than he did against Burr.
</P>
<P>
   With so much to absorb, where should one start? I recommend
stopping by Bainbridge House, home of the Historical Society of
Princeton, a two-story brick house at 158 Nassau St., two doors
down from the intersection with Washington Street.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is a small but informative display on local history where
one can find everything from pottery created by the Lenape Indians,
the area's pre-European dwellers, to a placard with the Fitzgerald
quotation. The society sponsors a two-hour walking tour of
centrally located historic sites every Sunday afternoon at 2.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright and blustery day I took the tour, an energetic
volunteer guide led a crowd of us on a two-mile loop that stopped
before the quietly impressive Greek Revival exterior of Nassau
Presbyterian Church, paused at the imposing battle monument a
couple of blocks to the south (it was dedicated by President Warren
G. Harding) and took in the sight of Morven, the estate built for
Richard Stockton, who along with Madison's teacher the Rev. John
Witherspoon was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The
building served as the executive mansion for New Jersey governors
until well into this century.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide pointed out the former house of Mann (now home to
Princeton's Catholic campus ministry), then led us to 112 Mercer
St. for a look at the modest wood-frame house _ still a private
home _ where Einstein lived while at the Institute for Advanced
Study nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the neighbors' nonchalance as they went about taking
out trash and parking their cars, a crowd along the sidewalk was no
cause for remark.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Battlefield is about a mile farther down Mercer
Street, a distance I chose to drive on my own, rather than walk.
The site of Washington's victory is a graceful sweep of land,
impressively intact and preserved as an 85-acre state park. On its
southern side stands a late Colonial house built by a Quaker
farmer, Thomas Clarke, that sheltered the wounded American general
Hugh Mercer, who died there several days after he fell in the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These days the house is a small interpretative center with
written material and exhibits about the battle. In one display case
a thick telephone book with a hole blown through it for
contemporary demonstration purposes testifies to the destructive
power of an 18th-century musket ball.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone ambitious to learn more about Washington's New Jersey
campaign ought to consider a detour to nearby Titusville, N.J.,
where the 800-acre Washington Crossing State Park commemorates
Washington's crossing of the Delaware on Dec. 25, 1776. His troops
marched to Trenton, defeating Hessian soldiers in a surprise
attack. The visitors' center contains an excellent collection of
Revolutionary War military gear.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Princeton, to its north, lies another state historic
site, Rockingham, an 18th-century farmhouse on Route 518 in Rocky
Hill, N.J., which was Washington's quarters in 1783 while Congress
convened in Nassau Hall. Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and others
met with him there. What it looks like inside I never found out, as
I didn't make it past the door, finding the place closed one
afternoon and, on another, busy with a tour for a group of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing barred my way to the Princeton Cemetery, established in
1757 and containing a fascinating record of the town's history.
Owned by Nassau Presbyterian Church but with plots open to a far
wider population, it contains the grave of Grover Cleveland, the
only Democrat elected president between 1860 and 1912. Born in
northern New Jersey, he settled in Princeton after his political
career and became a trustee of the university.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist John O'Hara, the parents of the African-American
singer and actor Paul Robeson, and Sylvia Beach, founder of the
avant-garde Shakespeare &AMP; Company bookstore in Paris, a magnet for
literary expatriates in the 1920's, also lie here. So, too, do most
of the university's presidents, in a plot in the section known as
the Old Graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who became president of what was then called the
College of New Jersey shortly before his death in 1758, succeeded
his son-in-law, the Rev. Aaron Burr Sr., president from 1748 to
1757, and the man who supervised construction of Nassau Hall. Their
table-top gravestones bear lengthy Latin inscriptions, as does
Witherspoon's nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Burr, who studied theology before switching to law,
lies at their feet, under an upright stone that briefly notes his
military and political service _ discreetly avoiding mention of his
trial for treason after being charged with plotting to wrest a
chunk of the lower Mississippi Valley from the new republic.
</P>
<P>
   A pamphlet describing the cemetery's history, with a map showing
where to find its famous dead, is available at the historical
society.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton also has a good system of public parks. But the most
interesting space lies on the town's eastern side, where a state
park preserves the old Delaware and Raritan Canal, with a tow path
that makes a quiet place for walking, jogging or bicycling. If you
head north along it, toward Kingston, you skirt the shore of
Carnegie Lake, with ample chance to watch rowing crews at practice.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of places you may come across a small sign
describing construction of the canal more than 150 years ago by
Irish immigrants. Many of those men, who worked in difficult and
unhealthy conditions, died of disease. It is a sober reminder that
many anonymous hands have gone into shaping Princeton and its
surroundings.

   SMALL BUSINESS FARED WELL AT WTO, GOVERNMENT SAYS

<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 -- The tumultuous and unproductive world
trade talks in Seattle last week were actually rather calm and
successful for small business interests, Small Business
Administration head Aida Alvarez said Wednesday. But not everyone
shared her optimism, or even her enthusiasm on the importance of
international trade to the entrepreneurial community.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with States News Service, Alvarez downplayed the
influence of street protests on the delegates to the World Trade
Organization summit and said that trade representatives had an
unprecedented chance to learn about American small business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small businesses are all now a part of the international
arena,'' Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the trade mission to Seattle, Alvarez ensured that
small business had a voice in the U.S. strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an aggressive discussion [inside] the
administration for the role of small business in international
issues of any sort,'' Alvarez said. ``We engaged the U.S. Trade
Office. . .and they even contemplated a high level position at
[their office] that would deal exclusively with small business
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Federation of Independent Business, which did
not send representatives to Seattle, did not share Alavarez' belief
in the importance of international trade to small business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We survey our members pretty regularly and trade doesn't show
up on their list of priorities,'' spokeswoman Mary Crawford said.
``I couldn't tell you why.'' The NFIB's average member company has
six employees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that small businesses were
just beginning to get involved in policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of small businesses out in Seattle that were
taking an interest in what's going on with the WTO, and I find that
an interesting development,'' said Leslie Schweitzer, Senior Trade
Advisor for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo.,
said there could be even more attention paid to that community. In
a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Bond
asked for specific language on small business to be included in any
final agenda that emerged from the Seattle talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that some productive things happened, but there
certainly is room for more in terms of representing small business
at WTO,'' committee spokesman Craig Orfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez called the letter a sign of the increase in the national
awareness of the importance of small business to international
trade issues. If a trade agenda had emerged, she said, she hoped it
would have had the sort of specific words Bond sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that every time there was a discussion of trade barriers,
there would be a question of what it would mean for small
business,'' Alvarez said. She said language would also focus on
intellectual property and e-commerce, two items she said were vital
to small business.
</P>
<P>
   In general, talks on issues important to small business went
smoothly, Alvarez said, and were not suspect to the kind of
divisive sentiments expressed by some small nations inside the
conference hall, and by some protesters in the streets outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a controversial issue, it was positively
received,'' Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to organized labor's demands that working conditions
and wage levels be part of discussions, Alvarez said: ``By and
large small businesses pay minimum wages or more. We don't have
those kinds of issues for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now small businesses, the ones I've talked to, they're
interested in _ protection of trademarks and patents,'' she said.
``They're interested in removing barriers to trade. They don't want
to see restrictions to e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion on those issues went very well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Small Business Committee Chairman James Talent, R-Mo.,
was less pleased with the outcome of the talks, and felt that so
long as foreign markets in China and elsewhere remain closed, small
farms and technology companies will suffer, according to
spokeswoman, Michelle Dimarob.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disappointed,'' Dimarob said. ``Not as much attention
was paid to the actual issues, because everything sort of devolved
from what was going on outside the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The top priority for small businesses at WTO was simply getting
involved with the process, the Chamber's Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this was working as an educational tool,'' she said.
``There was certainly a lot of exchange, networking, and that is
certainly an important process to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the increase in national awareness, a new
international focus on small business will help, Alvarez said.
Several national governments are working with the SBA, learning how
to develop their own agencies to serve that community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they create similar programs, it will be easier for us to
do business,'' Alvarez said. The United Kingdom, Ireland,
Argentina, Egypt, South Africa, and Mexico are all working on
SBA-like programs. The SBA's director of international trade, James
Wilfong, met with WTO delegations from Japan, Europe, Latin
America, and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very, very busy,'' Alvarez said. ``Once we got there,
we had so many forums to speak about small business. It really was
a fabulous opportunity to get the message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, a former reporter who braved gunfire in Latin American
war zones, was not fazed by the sometimes violent street protest in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a kid of the late sixties,'' Alvarez said. ``When I went
to school the streets were always full of people protesting about
something. I always thought that was our right as American
citizens. It was really unfortunate that it was a really small
group of people who thought that the way to get attention was to be
violent.''

   HOLIDAY MOVIES, BY THE BOOK
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The holiday rush of movies, now well upon us, always
includes a fair sampling of book adaptations, both recent best
sellers and time-worn classics. Each comes with its own built-in
audience and predetermined respectability, guaranteed Oscar bait.
And this year's crop is, if anything, a bit bigger than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Before month's end, theaters will be showing adaptations as
diverse as ``Angela's Ashes,'' based on Frank McCourt's Pulitzer
Prize-winning memoir of growing up poor in Limerick, Ireland (with
Alan Parker directing Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson, as McCourt's
parents); ``The Green Mile,'' based on Stephen King's serialized
prison drama (with Frank Darabont directing Tom Hanks, as a Death
Row guard forced to confront _ well, you have to see it); ``Snow
Falling on Cedars,'' based on David Guterson's atmospheric drama
about cultural conflict in the Pacific Northwest (with Scott Hicks
directing Ethan Hawke); ``Girl, Interrupted,'' based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir of her year in a mental hospital in the 1960s (with
James Mangold directing Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie); ``Stuart
Little,'' based on E.B. White's children's story (with Rob Minkoff
directing Geena Davis and a computer-generated mouse); ``The
Talented Ripley,'' based on Patricia Highsmith's cold-blooded
thriller (with Anthony Minghella directing Matt Damon and Gwyneth
Paltrow), and ``The Cider House Rules'' based on John Irving's best
seller (with Lasse Halstrom directing Tobey Maguire and Michael
Caine).
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't even include a couple of adaptations of plays
(Julie Taymor's assertively idiosyncratic take on Shakespeare's
``Titus Andronicus,'' shortened to ``Titus,'' and Matthew Warchus'
adaptation of Sam Shepard's ``Simpatico'') or Martha Fiennes
directing her brother Ralph in ``Onegin,'' an adaptation of
Pushkin's narrative poem.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps none of them faced a challenge quite like Neil
Jordan's. He was charged with finding a way to adapt ``The End of
the Affair,'' Graham Greene's autobiographical story of wartime
love and spiritual anguish. The film opened last week in New York
and Los Angeles to generally positive reviews. Greene's drama is
about a writer, not unlike himself, who is deeply embittered when a
torrid affair with a friend's wife ends inexplicably during the
London blitz. But it's about more than that, also exploring issues
of religious faith and conscience not usually dealt with in
mainstream films, and it tries to explain, at least partly, why
Greene himself became a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I decided to structure the story, there are a series
of pivotal events that are at the center of the story,'' Jordan
said. He was not so concerned with the specific religious elements
of the story as he was with the way Greene built the plot, in which
the central character (played by Fiennes) completely misunderstands
what is in the mind of his lover (Julianne Moore).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he shot some of his pivotal scenes more than once.
One encounter in a restaurant, for instance, is shot once from the
point of view of Fiennes and then, later, after we learn his
lover's secret, from hers, and then yet again from the perspective
of a private detective peering at them through the window. The
scenes play at different times in the movie, and each time the
audience understands a little more about what is really happening.
The point is to show how easy it is to misinterpret what is on
someone else's mind, even someone with whom you are on the most
intimate terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the main reasons I wanted to make the movie,''
Jordan said. ``You read the book, and you get the sense of the
novelist's state of mind, but Greene had a wonderful story in there
with a wonderfully ironic sequence of events, if seen from
different points of view. First we experience what happens with
Ralph, then again with Julianne. By adding these two perspectives
together, yet another perspective emerges, something much more
mysterious.''
</P>
<P>
   He also found it necessary to excise one of Greene's supporting
characters, a rationalist preacher who undergoes a miraculous cure
that he cannot explain. ``In my opinion, the preacher was the least
successful character in the book,'' Jordan said. Yet the character
plays a role in the story's spiritual denouement, so Jordan
inserted a new character, the detective's child, to handle that
chore. ``To me, having a child in that situation just made it all
much more mysterious and believable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ACCENTING THEIR WORDS
</P>
<P>
   Holiday prestige pictures also mean actors' tackling foreign
accents, and this year has a bumper crop. Julianne Moore is not the
only American actress using a British accent; Jodie Foster gives it
a go in Andrew Tennant's ``Anna and the King.'' Michael Caine goes
American in ``The Cider House Rules.'' Tom Hanks tries a Southern
drawl in ``The Green Mile.'' By comparison, the Swedish-born Max
Von Sydow has it easy in ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' playing a
lawyer who happens to be a Scandinavian immigrant to the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two situations in my career,'' Von Sydow said. ``Most
of the time in America, I play the foreigner. It's minor parts, the
odd characters. You know: the artist, the doctor. Or the villain,
of course. The foreigner. But in European films, they ask me to do
anything. I play men of authority. They will dub it anyway, so no
matter what, I am not the foreigner.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, tanned and gimlet-eyed, Von Sydow leaned forward in a
sumptuous upholstered chair in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel in
Beverly Hills. In the film, the character he plays is old and
sickly, hardly able to walk down the street in the snow _ nothing
like the vigorous 70-year-old actor in jeans and running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This character was really a gift because I felt that I knew
him,'' Von Sydow said. His character acts partly as the film's
conscience, defending a Japanese-American fisherman accused of
murder in the late 1940s. ``He's just an ordinary man,'' Von Sydow
said. ``He's alone. He feels that life is close to the end.
Physically, he is not in very good shape. But he is no enigma to
me. I felt that I knew him. I felt that I had met him.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Sydow said he and his wife had rented numerous films with
important courtroom scenes and had watched them in his trailer
while on location for the film. He also regularly consulted David
Guterson's novel, on which the film is based, ``as a kind of
reference for things about this man'' _ the character he plays _
``that didn't get into the script.'' Mostly, he said, he was
delighted to be asked to play a meaty role in a Hollywood film that
did not require him to be a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was wonderful to do because he is a wonderful man,''
Von Sydow said. ``He is someone without any pretenses behind him. I
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   MUTE, EXPRESSIVELY
</P>
<P>
   If Max Von Sydow thought he had an easy time with his accent, it
was nothing compared to Samantha Morton's in Woody Allen's ``Sweet
and Lowdown.'' Of course, the British-born actress had other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ms. Morton, perhaps best known in the United States
for the title role in a 1997 television adaptation of ``Jane
Eyre,'' plays a nearly angelic mute laundress who falls in love
with a selfish, philandering jazz musician played by Sean Penn.
Without a single spoken line, she must convey a complex series of
emotions and not let actors like Penn and Anthony LaPaglia,
incessantly chattering Woody Allen dialogue, blow her off the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film gave me a chance to play somebody who was completely
free of emotional baggage,'' Ms. Morton said. ``It wasn't a
traumatic part; I didn't have to go through some terrible journey;
it didn't require me to go through a nervous breakdown or sexual
revolution. It was almost like playing an angel. I walked away from
work every day feeling very clean, refreshed just from doing the
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morton said she was helped by Allen's script, which she said
was extremely specific about what her character needed to bring to
each scene. ``I didn't have to plot anything,'' she said. ``It was
all there in the script. It wasn't difficult at all. Even though
she never speaks, she does say a lot. I never felt that she lacked
anything. I never even felt the urge to speak, the desire to speak,
and that was a very nice feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morton has another movie currently in limited release,
``Dreaming of Joseph Lees,'' and she will be seen in the next few
months in three other independent films: ``Jesus' Son,'' a favorite
at the Toronto International Film Festival in September,
``Pandaemonium'' (playing Samuel Taylor Coleridge's wife), and
``The Last Yellow,'' a dark comedy about a pair of misfits. But
mostly, she said, she is waiting to see how people react to the
Woody Allen film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when this film comes out, some more people will
consider me for their films,'' she said. ``It's very hard to get
scripts, you know, to get auditions. That's just the way things
happen. You know, I was very naive. I thought that you try to do
good work and the scripts come along. But it's also about how much
you're worth and how many people your name can convince to see the
film rather than because you're right for the role.''

   Interrupted Life, Interrupted Work
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The emotional impact of the death of the director
Mike Ockrent, who died of leukemia on Dec. 2 at 53, was still being
absorbed this week by many who knew him on Broadway. And at the
same time, there were questions about the future of two projects
with which the director was involved at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The more fully realized project was ``The Night They Raided
Minsky's,'' a new musical loosely based on the 1968 William
Friedkin movie about the old days of burlesque, which Ockrent had
been involved with for five years. The show was scheduled to have
its premiere in Los Angeles in July. Those plans are now up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's producers, Rocco Landesman, the president of
Jujamcyn Theaters, said it was simply too early to know what would
happen. ``Mike was not only the perfect director on this show, he
was largely the creative instigator,'' Landesman said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Timothy Childs, the lead producer.
``Mike had been the heart and soul of this show,'' he said. One
concrete development, however, was news this week that the
experienced producers Richard Frankel and Thomas Viertel (``Sound
of Music'') joined the production.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his bow to burlesque, Ockrent had also joined the
comedian Mel Brooks to adapt another movie about the raffish days
of show business into a musical, Brooks' ``Producers.'' Seth
Gelblum, who represents several parties involved in that project,
said it was still in its infancy but that Ockrent's loss would be
felt. ``Mike and Mel had a special connection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ockrent's survivors the show must go on. Word came this week
that the revival of the perennial favorite ``The Music Man,'' to be
directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman, Ockrent's wife, had
secured the Neil Simon Theater for performances beginning on April
3. Rehearsals, with a cast including Craig Bierko, Rebecca Luker
and Ruth Williamson, begin in February.
</P>
<P>
   A Role Change
</P>
<P>
   Considering the under-siege camaraderie that develops among
actors, it is not surprising to see that this month three
successful performers are helping their peers by taking on the role
of producer.
</P>
<P>
   The first up is ``Fully Committed,'' which has done quite well
in its earlier incarnation this year. The one-man comedy about a
beleaguered restaurant clerk was one of the hottest tickets
off-Broadway this fall when it played at the Vineyard Theater. It
is now moving to the Cherry Lane Theater on Tuesday with Mark
Setlock repeating the role of the harried reservations-taker.
Setlock had earlier appeared in ``Rent'' on Broadway with Jesse L.
Martin and Adam Pascal, who have, in turn, signed on to help him
produce his show in its new location.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much good, original material never gets to be seen,''
Pascal said. ``This is a way to give back.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one-man play, ``Another American: Asking and Telling,''
by Marc Wolf, is being produced by the actor and playwright David
Marshall Grant. The drama, focusing on gays in the military, opens
on Thursday at the Theater at St. Clement's.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he read the script earlier this year and suggested to
friends at New York Stage and Film, a theater company in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that they do a workshop of the play. ``I
suddenly realized,'' he said, ``that I'm actually helping produce
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Benched on Broadway
</P>
<P>
   Is Frank Gifford trying to cut in on his wife's territory? Not
quite, but maybe someday.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee Gifford, the morning talk-show host, made her
Broadway debut on Tuesday night in ``Putting It Together.'' Not to
be outdone, her husband, a former New York Giants football star and
sportscaster, auditioned last week for the role of Billy Flynn in
the Las Vegas version of the musical ``Chicago.'' And according to
his lawyer, Ron Konecky, he wasn't half bad.
</P>
<P>
   But Konecky said the rehearsal schedule, and a small window of
performances, made Gifford's participation impractical. Barry
Weissler, the show's producer and a man who has never shied from
salting his shows with celebrities, said he has always idolized
Gifford's football prowess. And his singing? ``Frank is the
greatest football player known to man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to Be a Lowlife
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that Fisher Stevens had pretty much
given up on acting, opting out of a television contract on CBS'
science-fiction show ``Early Edition'' and heading back to New York
to concentrate on his budding film-directing and producing career.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Harry Sobel.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, you see, is the central character in Bryan Goluboff's
play ``Shyster,'' a low-rent rake with bad hair whose best trait
may be his uncanny ability for self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I got to play this guy,''' said Stevens, adding with
a grin, ``The thing I like about acting is that it allows me to do
things that I could never do in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting and life have often been one and the same for Stevens. He
made his Broadway debut at 18 in ``Torch Song Trilogy'' and quickly
jumped to Hollywood with films like ``The Flamingo Kid'' and
``Short Circuit.'' But the theater and New York remained in his
blood and in 1986 he helped found Naked Angels, a stage company
with several young celluloid stars on its roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shyster,'' a Naked Angels production that opened to critical
praise on Monday and runs through Dec. 19 at the Blue Heron
Theater, may extend if the schedules of its stars, including
Stevens, Annabella Sciorra and the newcomer Charles Malik
Whitfield, can be worked out.

NUMBER CRUNCHERS WILL HELP DECIDE CONTROL OF HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dueling computer gurus who crunch statistics for a
living will have a big impact on who controls Congress over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   These backroom wonks become key players when, once every 10
years, they are enlisted to redraw the maps of the 435 House
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires that House districts be equal in
population and that job ultimately falls to lawmakers in the 50
states, but they rely on the high-tech expertise of the national
Republican and Democratic parties and people like Tom Hofeller.
</P>
<P>
   With a political science PhD and a nimble penchant for
statistics, Hofeller is the Republicans' redistricting czar. When
the Census Bureau delivers its new population data on a computer
disc on April 1, 1991, Hofeller will coach state legislators how to
sketch districts that favor Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the starting pistol on the redistricting race track,''
says Hofeller, a stout fellow with bright suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   If knowledge is power, then Hofeller has huge political clout,
at least once every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   His work is ``the only legalized form of vote stealing left in
the United States,'' Hofeller says. ``It's the ultimate power sport
in all of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the state legislatures and incumbent House members
requires plenty of tact.
</P>
<P>
   The process can ``bring out the worst in everybody'' because all
lawmakers assume ``the map will start with their district.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions run high. Hofeller says he once witnessed a fist-fight
on the floor of the Illinois House in 1981 when the legislators
were considering new boundaries for congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Hofeller appears amused at the once-a-decade deep bow that House
members make to state legislators when district maps are being
designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one time every 10 years that members of Congress
have to go back to the state legislatures and beg,'' Hofeller says.
``It's an awkward position to find themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, as the game plays out, ``the powerful people in each
legislature will be looking to reward and punish people from their
party and other parties,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gersh, Hofeller's Democratic counterpart, is the head
statistician for IMPAC 2000, the party's national redistricting
project. When it's redistricting time, state legislators sketch new
maps and often submit them for Gersh's review.
</P>
<P>
   He says he must work fast because some states show him 500
different variations of a map and they want quick answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spend a lot of time tweaking it,'' Gersh says.
</P>
<P>
   But Gersh says he is cautious not to butt in and ``big foot''
state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make myself helpful,'' Gersh says. ``Where they don't
need us we go on to somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained in statistics, accounting and math, Gersh says his
motivation is not primarily political.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an ideological person,'' he says. ``I enjoy the
numbers. I enjoy the process, that's basically what makes it
interesting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gersh says the most frustrating part of his task is balancing
the Democrats' goal of winning the most seats against individual
interests of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of very self-centered members who have safe
districts, but they don't want to give up a little bit to make it
possible (for the party) to win another one in an adjacent area,''
Gersh says.
</P>
<P>
   The redistricting competition will begin as soon as the new
Census data is analyzed to determine how many seats go to each
state.
</P>
<P>
   A complex mathematical formula known as ``The Method of Equal
Proportions'' reapportions the 435 House seats so that each state
gets at least one House seat. The remaining 385 seats are divvied
up so that each district has the same number of people.
</P>
<P>
   For example, under the 1990 census allocation, each House
district had about 572,500 people. Because of population growth,
the average district size under the 2000 Census is expected to be
about 637,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The slowly growing states of New York, Pennsylvania,
Connecticut, Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin are expected to lose
seats, while the faster growing Arizona, Texas, Georgia,
California, Nevada, Colorado and Florida are slated to pick up
seats.
</P>
<P>
   With the House now closely divided _ 222 Republicans, 212
Democrats and one independent _ every seat will count in the 2002
election, the first that will be held under the new map.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, chair of IMPAC 2000, says the role
the redistricting gurus will play is ``very crucial'' although
their efforts are often under the radar screens of most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is somewhat intangible,'' Bentsen says. ``This is the
subterranean election that you're not hearing about in 2000.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who chairs the National Republican
Campaign Committee, says Republicans ``are in better shape then we
have been since the 1920s'' going into redistricting because the
GOP now has greater control in the states.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control 31 governor's mansions, They control 48
state chambers, compared with 49 for Democrats. Two state houses _
the Washington House and the New Hampshire Senate are tied.
Nebraska only has one state chamber.

SHORT ITEMS ON WHAT'S NEW IN HOME VIDEO

   MUSIC CHOICES AND INTERACTION
</P>
<P>
   Of all the genres migrating to DVD, the long-form, or concert,
music video uses the format as fully as any. One reason is that
unlike videotape, which requires spooling and rewinding to move
around, the disc allows the viewer to pop about instantly and at
random. That gives the music-video audience, often a young one, a
lot to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more potential to engage the fans, get them more
involved with the artists,'' said Kevin Conroy, senior vice
president for worldwide marketing at BMG Entertainment. This fall,
the company, which distributes about 40 record labels, got into DVD
with ```Turandot' at the Forbidden City of Beijing'' and `` 'N
Sync: 'N the Mix,'' a collection of hits and other features by the
pop group.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini's opera, an elaborate $15 million production by BMG
Classics for PBS' ``Great Performances'' series, leans more toward
standard extras like a behind-the-scenes documentary and a chat
with the conductor Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   The 'N Sync disc keeps the group's teeny-bopper fans busy at the
remote control. Choosing from several menus and six small screens,
each playing clips of content options, viewers can skip about among
songs, a photo gallery, the life stories of 'N Sync's five members,
scenes from tours and video taping sessions, choreography
rehearsals, shots of the group at play and other items.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Lynyrd Skynrd: Lyve From Steel Town,'' with 15 songs
performed by the Southern rock band at a 1997 concert in
Burgettstown, Pa., any song is reachable virtually at any instant,
as is any element of the extra features, which include backstage
scenes, a band history (a long and tragic one), discography and
on-location interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viewer spends more time with disc than VHS,'' Conroy said.
In recent years, he added, the concert-length music video has
lagged somewhat, although VHS titles like ``Sarah McLachlan:
Mirrorball,'' a BMG title, and ``Woodstock 99,'' from Sony Music
Video, rank high on current best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   BMG has more than 20 titles on disc, among them ``Alabama for
the Record: Live,'' ``Styx: Return to Paradise,'' ``Anthrax: Return
of the Killer B's Video Anthology,'' ``Blondie: VH-1 Live From Town
Hall,'' ``Meat Loaf: VH-1 Storytellers.'' On Tuesday BMG will
release ``The Backstreet Boys'' and ``Time Out With Britney
Spears.''
</P>
<P>
   The McLachlan video, which appeared on DVD in October, includes
an interview with the singer and a ``scrapbook'' with photographs
from her life. Many BMG titles will also be available on tape, but
the emphasis will be on DVD. ``We've spent a lot of time with the
labels educating them on what's required,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some material already released on videocassette may lend itself
to the sharp images and big sound on disc. With their high
production values, concerts shot for television are good prospects.
``Turandot'' and the Alabama, Blondie and Meat Loaf discs are
examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is an original television production, we
immediately think about DVD,'' Conroy said. Some BMG labels are
shooting material exclusively for DVD. ``In future live concerts
made for DVD then could be a TV show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER
</P>
<P>
   To express its opinion of women in the military, Simon West's
film lets an incredibly promiscuous female Army captain (Leslie
Stefanson) make fools of some battle-hardened types before she is
murdered in spectacularly kinky fashion. Brought in to investigate,
the Army detective Paul Brenner (John Travolta) finds the brass
covering up for all its worth.
</P>
<P>
   But good actors are underused in a story that pumps up the
gratuitously ugly side. ``Nobody in this whodunit really seems
interested in the upshot,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times. ``All the movie cares about is the deed and the way it is
done.''
</P>

   BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB
</P>
<P>
   Wim Wenders' documentary mixes music by the ensemble Buena Vista
Social Club with impressionistic glimpses of urban life in
contemporary Cuba. The film springs from an album of 14 Cuban
mambos, boleros and cha-chas performed by musicians from Cuba's
pre-revolutionary old guard and put together by the American
guitarist and producer Ry Cooder. So intense are the joy,
camaraderie and national pride that you ``become convinced that
making music is a key to longevity and spiritual well-being''
(Holden).

<P>
   TEACHING MRS. TINGLE
</P>
<P>
   Acting on their misgivings about a nasty teacher named Tingle
(Helen Mirren), three students (Katie Holmes, Marisa Coughlin and
Barry Watson) barge into her house and tie her to her bedposts.
Sneeringly dismissive even when trussed up, Mrs. T. is to recant
unfounded cheating charges against one of them or, or _ or what?
``Maybe we should finish her,'' says one of the students.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Craven's ``Scream,'' written by Kevin Williamson, wouldn't
have needed the suggestion. But all this Williamson movie does is
``prove that Ms. Mirren can outshine a cute teen-age cast with her
hands tied'' (Maslin).
</P>

   1999. Dimension. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 96 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.

   DICK
</P>
<P>
   At last we learn the truth about Watergate. Late one night at
the apartment complex, two teen-agers, Arlene (Michelle Williams)
and Betsy (Kirsten Dunst), run smack into G. Gordon Liddy (Harry
Shearer), who is monitoring the famous break-in in progress at that
very moment.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a worried Richard Nixon (Dan Hedaya) seeks to buy the
girls' silence by offering them jobs as official walkers of the
presidential dog.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Arlene develops a crush on Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   But disillusionment sets in when the girls get to messing around
the Oval Office and stumble across some of those infamous tapes in
``an uproariously dizzy satire'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77; DVD, $24.95. 94 minutes.
Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.

 &HT;    CLINTON SETS GOAL OF BRIDGING 'DIGITAL DIVIDE'
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton called Thursday for a ``national
strategy for connecting all Americans to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Rose Garden speech, Clinton issued a memo directing the
heads of executive departments and agencies to work with the
private sector to make ``computers and the Internet accessible to
all Americans, with the goal of significantly narrowing the digital
divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House initiative came as Commerce Secretary William
Daley hosted a daylong meeting aimed at finding ways to increase
minority access to Information Age tools. It brought together
government officials with top communications executives, foundation
chiefs and community leaders, who engaged in a broad review of what
needs to be done to close a widening gap between haves and
have-nots in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that he had planned to attend the conference
before deciding to go to Worcester, Mass., for memorial services
that honored six firefighters who had died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the president's absence, Daley led a 13-member blue-ribbon
panel that, for the most part, approached the ``digital divide''
issue with an air of cautious optimism that positive changes can be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members, however, noted continuing problems that stood in
the way of Clinton's professed goal, for which no firm timetable
has been set.
</P>
<P>
   They included fragmented and uncoordinated efforts in dealing
with Internet education issues in poor areas; computer-savvy
teachers being hired away for better-paid industry jobs;
impoverished school districts which lack public funds to train
their disadvantaged students in Internet skills, and a failure on
the part of many large firms to properly target the already hefty
online market potential of African-American and other minority
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that places that have access to the Internet are
going to be growing faster than those that don't,'' said Zoe Baird,
president of the Markle Foundation, which has pledged to spend $100
million in the next three to five years to ensure that the Internet
meets public needs.
</P>
<P>
   But the real challenge, Baird added, is not only to raise access
to information technology but to offer truly appealing content.
``How can we use this tremendous vehicle,'' she asked, ``to deliver
information in ways that would energize people (and) engage people
to connect them to things that they really need in their daily
lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Following a similar tack, Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief
executive officer of AT&AMP;T Corp., predicted that broadband access to
the Internet, entering the home through affordable interactive
video services, could be the engine of progress that would reverse
the growing information gap within U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   Most families, including minority ones, Armstrong suggested,
``will have a device at home called a television set that will
connect them with the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton announced that next spring he would join
Armstrong, Daley and other top conference figures on another of his
``New Markets'' tours _ one that will ``focus specifically on the
digital divide out in America.''
</P>
<P>
   His tour, Clinton said, would strike a balance between places
``that have not fully participated in our nation's economic
growth'' and an upbeat note: Publicizing public-private
partnerships that ``can unleash the power of the Internet to link
children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to
distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to
enhance safety and foster economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, some of the key conference participants announced the
creation of an online ``Digital Divide Network'' to coordinate
their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides AT&AMP;T, the initial partners include America Online, Bell
Atlantic, BellSouth, Gateway, Intel, iVillage, Microsoft and SBC
Communications. The Benton Foundation will manage the site and
oversee its content, in coordination with the National Urban
League.
</P>

 &HT;    CLINTON SETS GOAL OF BRIDGING 'DIGITAL DIVIDE'
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton called Thursday for a ``national
strategy for connecting all Americans to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Rose Garden speech, Clinton issued a memo directing the
heads of executive departments and agencies to work with the
private sector to make ``computers and the Internet accessible to
all Americans, with the goal of significantly narrowing the digital
divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House initiative came as Commerce Secretary William
Daley hosted a daylong meeting aimed at finding ways to increase
minority access to Information Age tools. It brought together
government officials with top communications executives, foundation
chiefs and community leaders, who engaged in a broad review of what
needs to be done to close a widening gap between haves and
have-nots in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that he had planned to attend the conference
before deciding to go to Worcester, Mass., for memorial services
that honored six firefighters who had died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the president's absence, Daley led a 13-member blue-ribbon
panel that, for the most part, approached the ``digital divide''
issue with an air of cautious optimism that positive changes can be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members, however, noted continuing problems that stood in
the way of Clinton's professed goal, for which no firm timetable
has been set.
</P>
<P>
   They included fragmented and uncoordinated efforts in dealing
with Internet education issues in poor areas; computer-savvy
teachers being hired away for better-paid industry jobs;
impoverished school districts which lack public funds to train
their disadvantaged students in Internet skills, and a failure on
the part of many large firms to properly target the already hefty
online market potential of African-American and other minority
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that places that have access to the Internet are
going to be growing faster than those that don't,'' said Zoe Baird,
president of the Markle Foundation, which has pledged to spend $100
million in the next three to five years to ensure that the Internet
meets public needs.
</P>
<P>
   But the real challenge, Baird added, is not only to raise access
to information technology but to offer truly appealing content.
``How can we use this tremendous vehicle,'' she asked, ``to deliver
information in ways that would energize people (and) engage people
to connect them to things that they really need in their daily
lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Following a similar tack, Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief
executive officer of AT&AMP;T Corp., predicted that broadband access to
the Internet, entering the home through affordable interactive
video services, could be the engine of progress that would reverse
the growing information gap within U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   Most families, including minority ones, Armstrong suggested,
``will have a device at home called a television set that will
connect them with the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton announced that next spring he would join
Armstrong, Daley and other top conference figures on another of his
``New Markets'' tours _ one that will ``focus specifically on the
digital divide out in America.''
</P>
<P>
   His tour, Clinton said, would strike a balance between places
``that have not fully participated in our nation's economic
growth'' and an upbeat note: Publicizing public-private
partnerships that ``can unleash the power of the Internet to link
children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to
distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to
enhance safety and foster economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, some of the key conference participants announced the
creation of an online ``Digital Divide Network'' to coordinate
their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides AT&AMP;T, the initial partners include America Online, Bell
Atlantic, BellSouth, Gateway, Intel, iVillage, Microsoft and SBC
Communications. The Benton Foundation will manage the site and
oversee its content, in coordination with the National Urban
League.

Athens? Or will he never be happy anywhere but UCLA? Harrick won a
national title with the Bruins, but was fired after turning in a
false expense account and trying to cover it up. Then he took Rhode
Island to the NCAA tournament, quit to take the Georgia job,
reconsidered, and later decided to come after all. Harrick faces a
rebuilding job at Georgia, which is off to a slow start. The
Bulldogs play Wake Forest Saturday in the Delta Classic. (Wilkinson

`THE GREEN MILE:' THE WALK ON DEATH ROW   CAN SEEM VERY LONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two important figures in ``The Green Mile'' happen to
be a giant (Michael Clarke Duncan) and a mouse. But when it comes
to this extravagantly long death row drama, there are more
important matters of proportion to consider. To watch a film this
unhurried (three hours) is to choose a companion for a long ocean
voyage. It's a risk, and you hope that neither ship nor speaker
runs out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that ``The Green Mile,'' written by Stephen King at
great length and in multiple installments, does not truly warrant
such a marathon. It boils down to a well-populated drama with a
relatively simple story, one that could have been told with more
economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. As
adapted by Frank Darabont with as much exemplary skill as he
brought to King's other prison tale, ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
it's a film with a counterproductive tendency to take its time.
</P>
<P>
   But while a tighter film from Darabont clearly would have been
better, ``The Green Mile'' proves surprisingly successful under the
circumstances. First and foremost, it manages to linger on death
row without claustrophobia and to become wholeheartedly immersed in
what goes on there. Working casually, with the bookend flashback
device borrowed from ``Saving Private Ryan,'' it eases into the
story of what the very Southern-sounding Paul Edgecomb remembers
about his years as a prison guard. Tom Hanks, who is so
unaffectedly good that it has become redundant to say so, helps
ease the film into its just-folks storytelling mode.
</P>
<P>
   Edgecomb's bladder problems, which are the sort of thing on
which Darabont might have spent less time, help set up the chatty
back-and-forth of life on the Green Mile. (This place, where
condemned men take their last walks, got its nickname from the
color of its floor.) We meet Edgecomb's fellow guard Brutus Howell,
called Brutal (David Morse, who shares Hanks' laid-back timing and
sly delivery).
</P>
<P>
   Their colleague and nemesis is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison),
who is ``the governor's wife's nephew'' and acts accordingly. There
are more Green Mile regulars (including James Cromwell as the
warden), and each one drops his jaw when Duncan's John Coffey
arrives on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Although the colossal Coffey supposedly killed and raped two
children, he is a gentle soul. In fact when a mouse turns up as an
uninvited pet, Coffey seems delighted. (So do the guards; that's
the kind of place this is.) Then, in a scene with the mouse that
actually elicited shrieks from a preview audience, another side of
Coffey emerges. Finally there is a connection between the business
of executing prisoners and the film's strenuously spiritual side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' involves assorted acts of cruelty and one
lurid, extended electrocution scene that makes the horrors of the
death penalty grotesquely clear, but much of it is very gentle. The
mystical healing of Edgecomb's bladder trouble brings on some funny
moments with Bonnie Hunt, who does a charming turn as his wife.
Coffey's peculiar innocence is also given a lot of screen time. The
way in which this huge black man, who calls the guards Boss, is
given a magical capacity for self-sacrifice has its inadvertently
racist overtones as well as its Christlike ones. But as Duncan
plays him, Coffey is too flabbergasting a figure to be easily
pigeonholed anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Darabont keeps the winding story of ``The Green Mile'' on track
while also providing endless opportunities for the actors to shine.
The guards' camaraderie (with Barry Pepper as another group member)
is droll and engaging, while the prisoners make another kind of
strong impression. Harry Dean Stanton brings some bizarre fun to
the process of testing electrocution equipment, which is, of
course, also rendered with appropriate horror. Sam Rockwell
provides loads of local color as the worst, most hateful miscreant
ever to wind up on death row. Some characters are allowed to wear
out their welcomes before their time is up. There is one
overwritten pre-execution speech too many in Darabont's screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Green Mile'' builds to its inevitable spooky touches _
very few, since this King story concentrates so heavily on
character _ its drama mounts even as its seams begin to show. There
will turn out to have been much ado about relatively little when
the film is over. But unassumingly strong, moving performances and
Darabont's durable storytelling make it a trip worth taking just
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity and some
very grisly moments. &QL;

`WITNESS PROTECTION': PROTECTOR OR PROTECTED: WHICH IS WORSE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review. Time is for New
York area. Check local listings.) (dw) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to feel much sympathy for Bobby and Cindy Batton, the
central characters in ``Witness Protection.'' Bobby is a third-rate
weasel, a petty mobster who has profited handsomely from crime but
has greedily cheated his own bosses.
</P>
<P>
   When they catch on to his clumsy scheme and order him killed, he
decides to tell all to the feds to save his sorry skin. He
regularly lies to his wife, too, and neglects his children. Cindy
knows what line of work Bobby's in, but she chooses to look the
other way and enjoy the ill-gotten gains. These two deserve each
other, and they deserve whatever unpleasant comeuppance fate tosses
them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their fate is tough. That's the nub of this film, which
has its premiere Saturday night on HBO. As the title telegraphs,
the Battons and their two children are to be given new identities
and relocated by the federal witness protection program after Bobby
agrees to testify against the first-rate weasel for whom he worked.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, played with riveting intensity by Tom Sizemore and
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as well as their teen-age son, Sean
(Shawn Hatosy), and little daughter, Suzie (Skye McCole Bartusiak),
are spirited into a top-secret government compound, where they are
locked into a duplex apartment and observed via surveillance
cameras. They will live here for five days while they learn to
become new people, under the guidance of their eerily avuncular
tutor, a U.S. marshal named Steve Beck (Forest Whitaker).
</P>
<P>
   This process of forced metamorphosis is both fascinating and
frightening. The drama, while fictitious, comes with an aura of
authenticity. HBO says it was ``inspired by'' a 1996 article in The
New York Times Magazine by a freelance reporter, Robert Sabbag, who
shares credit for the film's story with the scriptwriter, Daniel
Therriault. Although the family described in the article was
different from the Battons in most respects, the wrenching process
is similar.
</P>
<P>
   The film's family has a lot to get used to, and not just new
names and some phony details of their past. Bobby, who is used to
giving orders, doesn't like being told he's going to Seattle, a
city he dislikes because of its rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either roll with the program or you pack your bags and
leave,'' Steve tells him in his firm and friendly way. ``It's
rainin' whether you like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   When this kind of persuasion doesn't seem to work, Steve has
boxes full of slides of people who have just met violent deaths:
headstrong dropouts from the government's little school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to live?'' Steve asks, without waiting for an answer.
``Then embrace your family and learn how to live in the world
legally. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby asks him, ``Why do you care?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Steve replies. ``It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby is a violent jerk, but Whitaker's Steve is the scariest
presence on display. Is he a warmhearted social worker, or is his
smile the frigid expression of a bureaucrat from hell? The film,
directed by Richard Pearce, never allows Steve to reveal the answer
to the Battons or the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   You do get to see what the Battons are made of as they start to
unravel under the pressure of their confinement and their
uncertainty about the future. ``I thought this would bring us
together,'' Cindy says, ``that we'd become a real family.'' Maybe
later. First they become increasingly angry, and all but the little
girl take that anger out on one another, often violently. The film
has a great deal of strong language.
</P>
<P>
   The four actors playing the Battons are convincing. Hatosy and
Ms. Bartusiak have the advantage of portraying innocent victims, so
they can rely on some sympathy from the viewer. Still, these two
young people give nuanced performances that hit a nerve. The adult
Battons, however, are at the story's center, and they are painted
as such venal people that their suffering is kept at a clinical
distance.
</P>
<P>
   You end up feeling like one of the marshals who monitor those
surveillance cameras. You're observing a destructive tragedy, but
it feels as if you're only doing your job.

`WALLOWITCH AND ROSS: THIS MOMENT' _ 30 YEARS IN PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(dw) 
 BY STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Morris' small, tender documentary film,
``Wallowitch and Ross: This Moment,'' peers into a cozy nook of New
York's cabaret world to pay homage to the partnership (personal and
professional) of the prolific songwriter John Wallowitch and his
companion of more 30 years, the dancer Bertram Ross.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, more than a decade after Ross left Martha Graham's
company, where he had been lead male dancer and Graham's male muse,
he and Wallowitch teamed up to create a jolly, informal cabaret act
that mixed Tin Pan Alley nuggets with Wallowitch's own witty
original songs.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of Morris' movie were filmed at a 1998 reunion
performance (attended by this writer) at the Ballroom, the
now-defunct New York club where the pair had made their
professional debut as a team 14 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Moment,'' which opens Saturday at Cinema Village, doesn't
explore the particulars of their relationship, nor are we given a
glimpse into their everyday domestic life on Manhattan's Upper East
Side. Instead the movie interweaves their separate biographies told
through photos, interviews and vintage film clips, then circles
back to their 1998 Ballroom performance.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically gifted in many areas, Ross grew up in Brooklyn and,
after dabbling in the visual arts, joined the Graham company in
1947. His descriptions of its inner workings and of the secretive
nature of its legendary founder are fascinating and a bit chilling.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the company after a blowup, the particulars of
which are not described, he became an important teacher of the
Graham style.
</P>
<P>
   Wallowitch, who was born in South Philadelphia, pursued a career
as a concert pianist while writing pop songs in the Tin Pan Alley
tradition of his idol, Irving Berlin. (Until Berlin's death, he
used to lead a caroling group that serenaded Berlin outside his
Beekman Place home every Christmas Eve.)
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Wallowitch reflects that his two musical lives
conflicted in a way that prevented him from ever writing a Broadway
show, but he doesn't tell us exactly how.
</P>
<P>
   Wallowitch has written more than 1,000 songs. Some are brash,
cheeky novelties like ``I Wish I Had Died at the Altar on the Day I
Married You.'' His best ballads, like the wistful ``My Love Went to
London'' (written when Ross went away on tour), ``This Moment'' and
``Come a Little Closer'' are pearls of homey observation about the
fragility and joy of life's happier moments.
</P>
<P>
   When he says quietly, ``Bertram is my life,'' it's clear that
many of those moments were spent together.
</P>
<P>

DOOR FLAP PUTS PUBLIC IN PUBLIC ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, Dec. 16.) 
(lh) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ    
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, of course, not your ordinary door. It's a piece of
sculpture in the shape of a door made out of concrete, weighing
3,000 pounds and lying on its back on a grassy berm. That makes it
art.
</P>
<P>
   The response to such a door depends on the imagination of the
person looking at it. The fact that it is slightly ajar might make
you shiver. Or it might make you smile. It might make you think of
time passing, the end of the century. Or a new one beginning. It's
a personal response, which also makes it art.
</P>
<P>
   The door has caused some flap in Sebastopol, a small town in
northern California. We have people as whipped up as they were in
New York City over a Virgin Mary painting at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   The large white slab that looks like a door from a Victorian
house reposes next to the firehouse, across from a church and
kitty-corner from a grade school. It is where kids in yellow
raincoats and red boots meet a crossing guard to cross to go to
school. The setting could be a page in a Richard Scarry kids' book
of Americana with your church, your school, your fire trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But not every small town gets to have public art or artists who
can create it. Some towns have only golden arches for sculptures.
Some towns don't get to debate art. It's causing a wonderful fuss.
People here are reminded of Christo, the artist who came to Sonoma
and Marin counties in the 1970s and said he wanted to run a curtain
across pastures and meadows to the ocean. Some people squawked and
some people were charmed and Christo just took it all in,
explaining that the head-shakers and would-be censors are part of
the process of art.
</P>
<P>
   One of the artists on the collaborative piece in Sebastopol, Ron
Rodgers, said that when he first saw it lying there he worried,
``What if no one notices it?''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The unnamed piece has been called everything from
a door to Hades to evil to a creepy thing. Door-haters threw a tarp
over it, wrote letters to the newspapers, complained to City Hall,
badgered the Fire Department for allowing it on public property.
And whether they are compelled by the door or the controversy,
people keep coming by the carload to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   It's supposed to be there for a year, but it's already done what
art is supposed to do _ make people look, scratch their heads and
use their imaginations. Artists don't expect to please everyone.
People stand in line at the Louvre just to see the Mona Lisa and
walk off complaining, ``It's kind of small.''
</P>
<P>
   Towns with artists and art critics are lucky. There is no other
town but Sebastopol right now that has this particular door, and
people who disagree over whether it's a dumb door or a delightful
door or the devil's.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has turned into an evolving art form. After the censor's
tarp was removed someone put a harvest wreath on it, treating it
like a real door. Then someone put up the symbols for Ladies and
Gents and turned it into a restroom door. Artist Rodgers puzzled
over that one and then decided, ``That's clever. Someone sees it as
sleeping in the earth. The door is at rest. Hence, rest room.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently it wears a Christmas wreath, and there's a Santa
decoration beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that a door into the earth scares children. But
that would only be if children are taught to fear what's
underground. And maybe it's not leading underground, anyhow, but
out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Why would children automatically fear what's in the earth?
Surely they know that's where tulips get their start. What if Alice
had run screaming from the rabbit hole instead of looking for
adventure?
</P>
<P>
   In this area about the only thing diabolical known to live in a
hole in the ground are gophers. If the artists could create a door
to lock out the gophers they would be popular with everyone. The
sculptors were surprised by the ferocity of their critics, but they
are enjoying the mixed response. Tom Montan said he was surprised
so many people read so much into it, but says it's a testament to
``the power of the ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   There is pressure on the City Council to move the piece to a
location where it won't be seen by people who worry about the
devil, but already there is a movement to save the door.
</P>
<P>
   Montan has heard from a group calling themselves Friends of the
Door. They promise to protest any move of the door by holding a
rally where they will play music by The Doors and carry door knobs
as a show of solidarity. They argue that if this door goes, whose
door will go next? Will all doors become suspect?
</P>
<P>
   How will we then know if we're coming or going?

   TUMBLEWEEDS
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer, Kimberly J. Brown, Jay O. Sanders, Gavin O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   Directed by O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   PG-13, 100 minutes
</P>
<P>
   One of two greatly similar films now in circulation (the other
being ``Anywhere but Here''), ``Tumbleweeds'' joins Mary Jo Walker
(Ms. McTeer) as she is bailing out of her umpteenth violently
abusive relationship. Shooing her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms.
Brown), into a battered car, Mary Jo heads off vaguely toward
Arizona with a stop in Jefferson City, Mo., where she plans to
snare a man whom she knew in high school. ``Now he finally can have
me,'' she tells her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet young girl, Ava is appalled, but being deeply attached
to her mother she goes along as gamely as she can. When the
Missouri man is less than advertised, Mary Jo heads for California.
A lusty, good-looking woman with a roving eye, she is fond of
tossing clothing out the car window and yelling, ``Yahoo!'' Near
San Diego, they go swimming and take up housekeeping with Jack (
O'Connor), a conservative, bossy truck driver, and Mary Jo enchants
a school chum of Ava's. ``I love your life and your four marriages,
and I think it's so great,'' the girl exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   The resilient Ava blossoms and wins the role of Romeo in a
school play. Mary Jo drops Jack, and mother and daughter benefit
from a friendship with Dan ( Sanders), a worthy, kindly fellow.
Nevertheless, Mary Jo is itching to head for Arizona, the primary
reason being that she no longer has a boyfriend. But then Ava makes
a stand.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Domestic brawls include smashed dishes and a
threatened punch or two, though the men seem more laughable than
menacing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: An intensely physical woman, Mary Jo is ready to erupt
around any man, but sexual situations are discreet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Quite a bit, but fitting given the people and the
stress they often are under. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-10: Older children in this bracket will relate to Ava,
but the film is a little too gamey for very young viewers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13: This is a hands-on mother-daughter relationship
between two people who totally and wildly love each other. Children
will be enticed, and, though parents may disagree, language and
sexual situations shouldn't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: Many girls will be engaged, as will their
mothers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ANYWHERE BUT HERE
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Eileen Ryan, Ray Baker, John
Diehl, Shawn Hatosy, Bonnie Bedelia
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Wayne Wang
</P>
<P>
   PG-13, 113 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Tumbleweeds,'' make the mother slightly more fragile and
the daughter much more mature, and you have ``Anywhere but Here.''
Ready for a change of men and scene, Adele August (Ms. Sarandon)
packs her 14-year-old daughter, Ann (Ms. Portman), in an old
Mercedes she can't afford and vacates home in Bay City, Wis., for
what she presumes will be a larger, more exciting existence in
Beverly Hills, Calif. Out there, or so the narcissistic Adele
supposes, she and Ann will suddenly be visited by a rosier reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ann, miserable about leaving home and skeptical of her mother's
judgment, has a clearer view. ``You're a crazy, unemployed
middle-aged schoolteacher with a child to support,'' she tells her
mother after life hasn't proved particularly elevating in Los
Angeles. By then the manically impulsive Adele has tired of her job
as a speech pathologist and been badly burned by a smirking
womanizer she meets at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Being the more adult of the two, Ann hunkers down over the next
couple of years and makes the best of a painful and often chaotic
situation by building solid friendships at school and doing well
enough academically to get into Brown University with a financial
package that is almosate to allow her to attend in the fall.
Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Adele, clinging to her daughter in childish desperation, uses
the expense issue to rule out Ann's getting away from her by going
East. In the end, though, even Adele tries growing up.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Adele gushingly tells the long-suffering Ann about her
experience in bed with her friend from the beach. Ann undertakes
some gentle sexual exploration with a schoolmate, though nothing is
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: The usual run of profanity, but not excessive.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: It's interesting to watch Ann, who is older and much
less dependent on her mother than Ava is in ``Tumbleweeds,'' try to
sustain a woman who in many ways is more of a child than she is.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-10: No.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13: Ms. Portman makes an appealing, competent heroine,
and by this age viewers will be caught up in her problems.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: Many older teenagers will also relate to Ms.
Portman and the scenario.
</P>

   LIBERTY HEIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe Mantegna, Ben Foster, Justin
Chambers, Orlando Jones, Rebekah Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Barry Levinson
</P>
<P>
   R, 134 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In another of his Baltimore films, Levinson goes back to the
'50s for a story of growing up Jewish in a time and place that
played hob with pat notions of ethnicity. ``Get ready, folks, Jews
are coming,'' says someone in a carload of Jewish youths arriving
at a high school party full of people fresh from a country club
with a sign at the entrance reading ``No Jews, dogs or coloreds
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben (Foster), a smart, cool Jewish boy who dresses up like
Hitler for Halloween just to see the reaction, and his older
brother Van (Brody) take their chances in a rapidly emerging
multicultural society. In one very nice development, and a
horrifying one to their parents, Ben begins a chaste but sexually
loaded friendship with Sylvia (Ms. Johnson), an equally bright
middle-class black girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kill me now,'' says Ada (Ms. Neuwirth), Ben and Van's
mother, at news of her sons' interethnic adventures. Their father,
Nate (Mantegna), runs a burlesque house and a numbers business,
which provide well for the family until a black drug dealer, Little
Melvin (Jones), hits a bonus bet that wipes Nate out and leads to
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Nate remains ever the gentleman and devoted husband and
father. And through these people an era comes delightfully alive.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: There is a fist fight, and Little Melvin waves a gun
around after kidnapping Ben and Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Some situations, none graphic, many references, and flashes
of nudity at the burlesque house.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Obscenities fly now and then, but they are never
gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?

 &HT;    GOOD JUDGMENT PREVAILS AS Y2K ``MOMENT OF TRUTH'' APPROACHES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago at this time, journalists were
struggling with their own Y2K problem: how to tell people about the
computer software bug without sounding overly alarmist or
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   Write too many stories about Y2K stockpiling and we might start
a stampede to the grocery store. Do too few stories about the
seriousness of the programming flaw and business owners might
ignore Y2K until it was too late to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Midnight Moment of Truth nearly here, polls suggest
the media may have gotten the story about right. Awareness of the
Y2K bug is extremely high, with polls showing nine out of 10
Americans know about it. Considering that two years ago, most
people would have guessed that Y2K was a new and improved personal
lubricant jelly, that's a remarkable change.
</P>
<P>
   But while Y2K has become a household word, only a fraction of
households plan to take extreme action, such as yanking their
savings from the bank. A recent poll conducted by the Gallup
Organization found most people are planning to take only prudent
steps, such as making copies of financial records in case of
computer glitches caused by the bug after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, many ``trend watchers'' insisted Y2K
stories, along with promotions for New Year's Eve parties and
concerts, would trigger all sorts wild reactions. Some forecasters
said that by mid-December 1999, federal troops would be restraining
mobs of panicky shoppers at grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Gary North, a religious fundamentalist who started a popular
Internet site on Y2K bugs, predicted that ``months before January
1, 2000, the world's stock markets will have crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who saw New Year's Eve 1999 as the ultimate party
opportunity predicted that business owners would be shutting down
factories and offices in the week's leading up to Dec. 31 because
so many employees would be missing work to party in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But now well into December 1999, the buzz word for the month is
buzz. As in buzzzz, zzzzz, snore. Store shelves are piled high with
foods and banks operate normally.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K has stirred up a sensible concern about computer
reliability, rather than a panicky rejection of technology. And the
marketing efforts to spur lavish spending on New Year's Eve parties
seem to have rekindled a desire to stay home with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the mellow millennium approaches, consumer confidence is
rising, the stock market is soaring and computers are continuing to
boost our affluence.
</P>
<P>
   The trend watchers tried hard to figure out where we would be
heading at the end of the century. But there was one mega-trend
coming that no one saw: a widespread outbreak of good judgment.

predicting a ``moderate'' season in 2000 with 11 named storms,
seven hurricanes and three intense hurricanes. Gray said the

   CDC-HIV _ ATLANTA _The CDC Thursday recommended that states
begin tracking people infected with HIV by name, in an effort to
follow the progress of the AIDS epidemic. The federal agency has
long recommended that HIV patients be identified - though not by
name - so officials can track new cases and target prevention
efforts. But new guidelines issued by the CDC call for new
name-based reporting guidelines in all 50 states - an approach that
has been harshly criticized by advocates for people with AIDS, who
say it could compromise medical privacy. (Guthrie, Atlanta

seriously state that she hopes to someday ``eat hummos in
Damascus.'' ``I would like to see the place. It is right next
door,'' Arad said. Though attempts at bringing a peace between
Syria and Israel have ended in failure before, this week's
announcement that talks will begin again in Washington next week
raised hopes that one of the toughest obstacles to peace in the
Middle East could finally be removed. We look at key issues,

 &HT;    Honoring the faith, spirit of Guadalupe
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ On Dec. 12, a substantial number of area
residents will mark one of the most important days of their year.
</P>
<P>
   The larger community may well be unaware of it and that is a sad
thing because it's one of the happiest days for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   It is the day of the Guadalupes. Most folks in Texas know
someone named Guadalupe. Maybe they're called Lupe or Lupita, if
it's a girl or a woman. But many men carry the moniker, probably
the most common in the Mexican community. It's my first name.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta de la Virgen Guadalupe is akin to St. Patrick's Day.
On Dec. 12, all who have even the slightest connection to Mexico
celebrate Guadalupe's day. The event is an official feast day in
the Catholic Church but on the day when ``La Virgen'' is honored,
Mexican people of all faiths claim her.
</P>
<P>
   Her story begins in 1531 in the mountains near Tepeyac, close to
what is now Mexico City. It was a few years after Columbus came to
America and the indigenous people were confused and frightened by
the European invaders that had come to their land. Juan Diego, one
of those native people, saw a beautiful lady one day as he went to
visit his sick uncle. The lady spoke to him and directed him to go
to the bishop and have him build a shrine on the spot in her honor.
She had come to claim the New World and become the caretaker of its
people in the name of Her Son, she declared to him.
</P>
<P>
   The awed young peasant delivered the message several times but
was ridiculed then challenged to bring some proof of this beautiful
lady that he claimed had dark skin like his and a voice like music.
Her clothing was like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he brought the bishop proof: fragrant Castilian
roses. The blooms cascaded from Juan Diego's tilma, his cloak, as
he presented it to the churchman on that winter day. He had picked
the flowers at the lady's direction, he explained, fresh from the
spot where she had told him they would be.
</P>
<P>
   As the roses spilled out of the tilma, an image of the
dark-skinned lady, La Morenita, was imprinted on the poor man's
cloak. It was neither painted nor drawn on. Nor was it embroidered
there. It just was.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop was convinced. The original basilica of Our Lady of
Guadalupe still stands in the former lake bed outside Mexico City.
Because some years ago the massive structure began sinking into the
soft ground, the thousands who make pilgrimages there are no longer
allowed in for safety reasons. A new basilica was built just a few
yards away from the original and there hangs Juan Diego's cloak
bearing the image for the ``Guadalupanos,'' her devotees, to see.
</P>
<P>
   The devotion she commands is awe inspiring. On any day you can
see bands of pilgrims making their way to the shrine, some on their
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I bought a book, based on a doctoral
dissertation on Our Lady of Guadalupe's relevance to Mexican
American women in today's American society. The author examines how
Guadalupe's lessons on service, humility and obedience fit into a
society that values assertiveness, self-sufficiency and power.
</P>
<P>
   After pondering that question and the way I was taught as a
young child to revere this icon, then looking at my life today, I
realize the true power such a messenger holds.
</P>
<P>
   Look at her story. It's one of faith, mission, organization,
leadership and getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how many women do you know who have the chutzpah to
drop in on a bishop a few days before Christmas and start ordering
him around?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, me too.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Large ocean swells were detected Thursday by an offshore buoy
near Los Angeles, prompting heavy surf advisories for parts of the
southern California coast. Heavy surf will prevail Friday as gusty
winds from the northwest develop in the wake of a low pressure
system heading toward the southern Rockies. Winds across southern
California will shift later Friday and Friday evening, blowing from
the north-northeast and thereby helping to import chillier air into
the region. Across middle sections of the Central Valley, winds
will slacken Friday night, raising the possibility of frost.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the disturbance that spawned severe weather Thursday
across the western Gulf states will weaken as it approaches the
central Appalachians and Ohio Valley. As a result, isolated
thunderstorms will develop early Friday. But, given that the system
will steadily weaken, the risk of thunder will diminish east of the
Appalachians across the Virginias and Carolinas by Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of rain will develop across the eastern Great Lakes and
western New England states as a potent jet stream disturbance
approaches from the upper Great Lakes. Along the New England
Seaboard, early sun will give way to increasing clouds, but the
arrival of rain will wait until Friday night. By Saturday morning,
the arriving jet stream disturbance will foster a deep low pressure
system over the Gulf of Maine. In its wake, chilly winds from the
northwest will increase to speeds of 20 mph to 30 mph, while rain
will change to snow across northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SEVERE STORMS
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms rumbled across the western Gulf states
Thursday as a potent jet stream disturbance marking a pool of cold
air aloft arrived from the Rockies. In late autumn, evaporation
rates over the Gulf of Mexico subside as water temperatures lower
with the season, lessening the amount of available moisture in the
air. Moreover, with the sun lowering in the sky, surface
temperatures decrease. To compensate for the lack of surface warmth
and moisture that destabilize the atmosphere, a potent disturbance
must provide exceptional cooling aloft to spark severe weather in
December.

<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun

   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated

<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob

   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short list come Academy
Awards time for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar
mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy, indomitable mom, brings
her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood to become a star. The
plot is negligible, but the performances are the point. (ERG) 1
hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who loses
his girl, Anne (Renee Zellweger), then finds he'll inherit $100
million if he marries within 24 hours. A clumsy remake of Buster
Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,'' it retains the
original's surreal image of thousands of potential brides chasing
the groom-to-be. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long
</P>
<P>
   and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Meshell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Deuce Bigalow:
</P>
<P>
   Male Gigolo'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rob Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Choppy, cheap-looking and with dead spots like the Sahara, it
also has a surprising number of genuinely funny bits, most of them
slapsticky and gleefully rude. Rob Schneider plays Deuce, a fish
tender who moonlights as a ``manwhore,'' and, although he has never
been funny for more than three minutes at any previous time in his
career, he sustains a level of genial, tasteless humor. (Chris
Hewitt, Knight Ridder) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' R (violence and gore, a strong sex scene,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest he-man Arnold
Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano with a
beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this explosion-happy
thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography and bloated with
bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie full of punches but
no spark. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawless'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro
</P>
<P>
   and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a guilty pleasure _ if they'd made it 30 years ago.
You could slip it into the VCR and giggle at its dated,
consciousness-raising plot and its by-the-numbers tale of a
homophobic security guard (Robert De Niro) who learns to respect
the brassy/soulful drag queen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) next door.
Unfortunately, the flick is a new release full of weary cliches and
flat comic bits. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing . ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of
package Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``House on Haunted Hill'' R (violence, gore, sexual images,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen and Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   A redo of the 1958 Vincent Price spookfest, it's a loud assault
on the senses and a (literal) bloody mess. But as a
meat-and-potatoes (or guts-and-eyeballs) scare machine, it has its
moments. Geoffrey Rush invites five strangers to spend the night in
a haunted house to win $1 million each. Then the gore begins. (SM)
1 hour, 55 minutes C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   More smoke than fire in this reality-based film about what
happened when former tobacco consultant Jeffrey Wigand (Russell
Crowe) agreed to tell his story on ``60 Minutes'' at the behest of
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Bergman gets the star
treatment (one senses a certain pandering to Pacino), but Wigand's
predicament is more riveting, with Crowe in an Oscar-worthy
performance. (ERG) 2 hours, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' R (sexuality, profanity and brief violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Oh,
</P>
<P>
   Don McKellar
</P>
<P>
   and Callum Keith Rennie.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely, offbeat look at the end of the world. Unlike
Hollywood's special-effects behemoths, Canadian
writer-director-actor Don McKellar treats the final apocalypse with
a dry wit and a sense of decorum that consciously tweaks that
nation's reputation for civility. A strong ensemble cast
(especially Sandra Oh) relate a variety of tales that are simple on
the surface, but cut deep. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Light It Up'' R (violent content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Usher Raymond,
</P>
<P>
   Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and Vanessa L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They should have burned the script. Atlanta's Usher Raymond
leads students from a horribly overcrowded high school in taking a
cop hostage and demanding a good education. Every moment of painful
injustice is rendered in slo-mo. Every cry of anguish
ever-so-slowly erupts from some kid's wrenched guts. It's about as
soapy a movie as you're likely to see. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 43
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger:
</P>
<P>
   The Story of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles, a rape,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Milla Jovovich
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
swordplay slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep
</P>
<P>
   and Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The Meryl Streep Show _ and what a show it is. Streep and
director Wes Craven (``Scream,'') have delivered a rarity: an
inspirational movie that is actually inspirational. The film
follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant kids,
confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in her
battle to teach violin to inner-city kids. It's a glorified TV
movie, but it's got Streep and that's all it needs. (ERG) 2 hours,
3 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and Redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+

   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. C

<P>
   Animated feature

<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino) 1

</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. Essentially,
it's a ``once upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature
and civilization. Boldly innovative (often savagely so) yet eerily
innocent, it's the sort of thing you simply have to see for
yourself. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-

   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:

   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher

<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women or children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+

<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his 1966 John Deere riding mower more than
300 miles to reconcile with his estranged brother (Harry Dean
Stanton). The movie is a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41

   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of

<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Train of Life'' R (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lionel Abelanski
</P>
<P>
   and Rufus.
</P>
<P>
   Another Holocaust wish-fulfillment comedy. In 1941, some Eastern
European Jews decide to beat the Nazis at their own game. They
stage their own deportation, fooling the Nazis into thinking
they're headed for a concentration camp. The cast overacts and the
plot is worthy of a ``Hogan's Heroes'' episode, but the premise is
inventive and a coda makes up for much that went before. In French
with subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 43 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' PG-13 (profanity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and a scene of domestic discord)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Janet McTeer
</P>
<P>
   and Kimberly J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely give this one a tumble. Janet McTeer and Kimberly J.
Brown are already generating Oscar buzz for their sensational
performances in this funny, heartfelt film. McTeer is a sassy
Southerner with a talent for finding the wrong men. Brown is her
savvy adolescent daughter who knows her mom's hit-and-run tactics
all too well. It sounds like ``Anywhere But Here,'' but it's a far
more real, more affecting work. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality and
innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan,
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th James Bond movie is more of the same old same old.
Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence.
It's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but
they were thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours,
8 minutes. C-

RICHTER PUNCHES HIS WAY OUT OF SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the season, Mike Richter, the Rangers' goalie,
predicted one negative effect of the new rule regarding the goal
crease. Goals would no longer be disallowed when video review
showed the skate of an attacker in the blue paint ahead of the
puck. This would mean trouble, Richter said then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be driving in and out of the crease and
actually hitting you,'' Richter said. ``There's going to be a lot
more disputes. You are vulnerable when you are looking at the puck
and you get blind-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, in a 2-1 Rangers victory in overtime over
Edmonton at Madison Square Garden, Richter and Aleksander Selivanov
of the Oilers presented Exhibit A of this theory. While driving to
the net late in the third period, Selivanov was cross-checked in
the head by Mathieu Schneider, a Rangers defenseman. As he tumbled
toward the net, Selivanov crashed into Richter, knocking the goalie
over before banging into a goal post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have lot of sympathy for him,'' Richter said of
Selivanov. ``He jumped right on top of me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Richter jumped up and began to throw punches at the body of
the prone Oiler, swinging his right arm covered with his big
blocking glove. Players for both sides entered the scrum, and
Richter finally emerged with his helmet and face mask off, his hair
mussed and the back of his shirt pulled up toward the top of his
suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   Richter got only a two-minute roughing penalty. The scene was
memorable for fans of the usually mild-mannered goalie, a senior
Ranger, who joined the team in 1989 and is now 33 years old.
Richter joked that he ``had a few wires crossed,'' but then turned
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when forwards take advantage of the goalie,''
Richter said. ``They head to the net, without any regard for the
goalie at all, in fact, trying to take him out. It's happened
enough. The refs can't always call it and certainly haven't been.
You're just vulnerable as a goalie. I think the goalie should have
the leeway to swing back.''
</P>
<P>
   This fracas overshadowed a splendid effort, Richter's best of
the season, the sort he presented in 1994, when he led the Rangers
to the Stanley Cup, and in 1996, when he led the United States to
the championship of the World Cup tournament. Richter made 37
saves, two of them on breakaways, several more on shots from
point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   He played patiently and alertly inside the crease, remaining
upright most of the time and moving quickly from post to post.
Richter has given up only six goals in the last four games and the
Rangers are 3-0-1, their best stretch of the season, with two of
those victories in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Their record of 10-14-4-1 still puts them in the bottom third of
the 28-team league, but their hope now is that the second quarter
of the schedule will be better than the first. The fans are
chanting Richter's name, which is better than some things they were
chanting earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's trying to kind of renew and start off on a
different foot and try to forget what just happened,'' Richter said
of the 2-9-2 slump that preceded the current streak. ``That's the
hard part. You can get negative. I think we all realized in the
last little while we had to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emotion is definitely more positive than it was. Our
discipline is much better. Our intensity doesn't seem to wane as
much as it did. We're not doing everything right. We can play
better. But we're giving ourselves a chance to win. It's a heck of
a lot more enjoyable to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   As for stopping breakaways against Todd Marchant and Doug
Weight, Richter praised his defensemen for chasing down the racing
forwards and forcing them to shoot quickly without many options.
Regarding his tussle with Selivanov, Richter said his last fight
was in the fourth grade. He threw a half-dozen punches Wednesday.
Did they connect?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Richter said, speculating that he probably hit
two teammates, the referee, the goal post and the ice.

 &HT;    A mother-daughter flick that goes the distance
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sensational independent film ``Tumble-
</P>
<P>
   weeds'' tumbles into theaters just in time to put a slight
Oscar-nomination pall on the superficially similar ``Anywhere But
Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the two movies have things in common. Both focus on a
mother-daughter relationship. Both offer powerhouse performances in
the leads. But, as good as Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman are
in the higher-profile, studio-backed ``Anywhere,'' Janet McTeer and
Kimberly J. Brown have them beat by a country mile. Their
rough-and-tumble, ties-that-bind relationship makes the
Sarandon-Portman version look, well, a little Hollywood glossy. A
little Hollywood hollow. A little Holly-
</P>
<P>
   wood, period.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer, a British actress best-known for her Tony-winning turn
in a 1997 revival of ``A Doll's House,'' plays Mary Jo Walker, a
sassy, vibrant Southerner with a Scud-missile radar for finding the
wrong men. But while Mary Jo _ a belle manque who could make
Blanche Dubois blush _ knows how to make an entrance, she's even
better at making exits. All that 12-year-old Ava (Brown) needs to
hear is some angry words between her mom and Husband No. 4 and she
starts packing her suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the two head for the sea and San Diego. Once there,
Ava settles in happily, making new friends and landing the lead in
the school's Shakespeare production. Mary Jo settles in, too.
Meaning, she finds a meaningless job (her boss is Michael J.
Pollard from ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' still crazy after all these
years) and a new guy. He's Jack (director and co-writer Gavin
O'Connor), a decent but short-fused trucker whom Ava refers to as
Mary Jo's ``future ex-husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it won the Filmmakers Trophy at the Sundance Film
Festival, ``Tumbleweeds'' has its problems. The script, co-written
by Angela Shelton (whose childhood memoirs provide the basis), is a
bit schematic. For instance, Jack's rapid descent into potential
brutishness seems designed to show Mary Jo's self-destructive
pattern more than anything else. And Jay O. Sanders' conveniently
available Nice Guy is just that: convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the film has a tendency to linger over scenes. This,
however, can be seen as a plus as well, because it gives the story
texture and the performances room to breathe. There are so many
wonderful touches _ a kissing lesson (the way McTeer handles an
apple is incredibly instructive) or some we're-so-foul fooling
around when Ava gets her first period.
</P>
<P>
   Young Brown isn't as polished as her ``competition'' (Portman),
but she's totally believable as a smart, funny, sometimes insecure,
sometimes a pain-in-the-butt adolescent. She never really hates her
mother _ she's too good a kid for that _ and she's too grounded to
be completely bamboozled by her. Their relationship is refreshingly
unneurotic. While you'll probably hear comparisons to Martin
Scorsese's 1975 movie ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' what's
shown here is far more compelling and emotionally real.
</P>
<P>
   As for McTeer, this is her U.S. film debut, and any filmmaker
with any sense should be knocking down her agent's door. She knows
how to be flirty without being obnoxious, how to be resilient
without being oblivious. Most of all, she knows how to center a
movie without being defensive or self-conscious about anchoring a
``chick flick.'' Whether she's picking her teeth with a fork,
swilling an RC Cola or swooping down on a prospective mate, she's
someone we haven't seen in a while: the sort of genuine
Southern-gal survivor who'd make Scarlett proud.
</P>
<P>
   And, when she and Brown sing an a cappella duet of ``Que Sera
Sera,'' it's one of the most magical movie moments of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown. Directed by Gavin
O'Connor. Rated PG-13 for profanity, sensuality and
</P>
<P>
   a scene of domestic discord. At Tara. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   Definitely give this one a tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects:
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer has a chance for best actress, and Kimberly J.
Brown should be considered for best supporting actress.

FRANCE REFUSES TO LIFT BRITISH BEEF BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain reacted with fury Thursday to France's surprise
announcement that because of continued fears over so-called mad-cow
disease, it would not, after all, lift its ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their action is completely and totally unjustified,'' Prime
Minister Tony Blair said, warning that he would raise the issue
when he meets the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, at a
European Union summit meeting Friday in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission, the union's governing body, said it had
no choice but to begin legal proceedings against France in an
effort to force it to lift the ban, as the commission has ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the circumstances, there seems to be no alternative but to
proceed with legal action against France in the European Court of
Justice as soon as possible,'' said David Byrne, the European
Union's food safety commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The commission gave notice last month that it intended to take
France to court if the ban was not lifted, and after weeks of talks
it appeared that France was ready to begin accepting British beef
again.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday the French food safety agency refused to
declare British beef safe from the risk of mad-cow disease, which
causes a wasting of the brain, and Jospin said he would maintain
the ban out of concern for the health of his country's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   France's decision, in defiance of a European Commission ruling
that British beef is safe, was seized by the British government's
political opponents as an embarrassing blow to Blair's efforts to
resolve the dispute through diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much longer must Britain tolerate the humiliating
spectacle of our prime minister dancing like a puppet to Mr.
Jospin's tune?'' asked Tim Yeo, the Conservative member of
Parliament who serves as his party's agriculture spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's position was not helped by the headlines in some
newspapers Thursday. ``Beef: Now It's Humiliation,'' the
influential Daily Mail, which blows hot and cold in its support of
the government, said on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   In a raucous scene in the House of Commons Thursday, Tory
members of Parliament all but drowned out the agriculture
commissioner, Nick Brown, with cries of ``Resign!'' as he rose to
give a statement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the government maintained that its ``softly, softly'' policy
had been the correct one, and that it should not be blamed for
France's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they do need to be reminded that the EU is not like
some sort of Woolworth's pick-and-mix counter where they can choose
some regulations that they agree with and others that they don't,''
Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, said of the
French.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, urged Britons
to boycott French goods in retaliation, a tactic Blair has opposed
to prevent the dispute from turning into a full-scale trade war
between two countries that rely heavily on trade with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would urge consumers to think very carefully when they go
shopping before they buy any French produce and to buy British
instead,'' Gill told reporters Thursday morning. ``We have to send
a very clear message to the French government about what the
British people think of their action.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous calls for a British boycott have not been particularly
successful, although Brown, the agriculture minister, has said he
will not buy French products until the ban is lifted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some supermarket chains have made cosmetic concessions to
anti-French sentiment by, for instance, more clearly marking what
country food comes from. One chain, Somerfield, has stopped selling
French apples. Another, Asda, announced Thursday it would stop
buying Charlotte potatoes from France, and buy British ones
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sainsbury's, one of the largest supermarket chains, said that it
had seen no decline in demand for French products and that it had
no plans to remove any. ``We feel it is up to the customer to
decide what they want to buy, and if they want to boycott French
products, that is their choice,'' a spokesman for Sainsbury's said.
</P>
<P>
   In France, officials defended the decision not to lift the ban,
saying consumer safety was their most important consideration. ``If
the British react badly to this, as we fear, then it will be very
damaging for Anglo-French relations and will prevent discussions on
the fundamental issues,'' said Jean Glavany, the agriculture
minister.

 &HT;    Hiking just one way to discover Bermuda's beauty
 &HT;    Eds: Emabargoed for Sunday, Dec. 12.
 &HT;    By James D. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAILEY'S BAY, Bermuda _ Thank goodness for government
boondoggles. Otherwise, Bermuda might not have one of its most
visitor-friendly attractions: the Railway Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one miles of scenic right-of-way is all that's left of
the Bermuda Railway, which operated for only 17 years after earning
the dubious distinction of being the most expensive railway, per
mile, ever built.
</P>
<P>
   After the government sold off the rolling stock and tracks, the
right-of-way property was turned into a series of scenic trails
that provide ideal paths for bicyclists and hikers. Though cars are
not allowed, motor bikes are permitted on portions.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is divided into seven sections. A handy walking guide,
available at most hotels and other tourist sites, provides detailed
maps and commentary on sights along the way.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I walked the 1.75-mile section from Somerset Bridge
to the bus station in Somerset, stopping off at Scaur Hill Fort
Park and enjoying the scenic panorama from its heights.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we were greeted by teenagers sneaking smokes on
the way home after school, and we stopped to chat with farm workers
harvesting potatoes in a field. We got to see where Bermudians work
and live, close up, which was a far cry from the confines of the
beach resort where we were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day we had taken a bus to the Bermuda Triangle
Brewery, where we sampled fresh beers direct from the tap, assisted
by a chatty local resident who filled in for the busy brewmeister.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the brewery, our plan had been to catch the ferry
at Somerset Bridge back to the capital city of Hamilton. But when
we missed the boat by a couple of minutes, we set our feet to the
Railway Trail and discovered the best way to take in this small
island nation, which consists of more than 180 named islands and
islets, only 20 of which are inhabited.
</P>
<P>
   Since rental cars are not allowed, it's good that the largest
island, Bermuda, which also gives its name to this tidy little
nation of small towns and parishes (local governmental divisions
similar to counties), measures about 22 miles east to west and is
rarely more than a mile wide. The public bus and ferry system
travels to all the main attractions. Bicycles, motor scooters,
taxis and walking are other popular ways to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Gert, which brushed Bermuda in September with 110-mph
winds, washed away three miles of its famed Pink Beach and damaged
the Natural Arches on the island's south shore. Otherwise, damage
was limited to downed trees, some localized flooding and power
outages _ nothing permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Other sights worth taking in include:
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda Arts Centre, Dockyard: Meet local artists who ply their
crafts while showcasing their work. Paintings, photographs and
sculpture, as well as jewelry, scarves and quilts are available.
The glass artists are fun to watch. 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. Free.
441-234-2809.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda Historical Society Museum, Hamilton: Par-la-Ville, a
house completed in 1814, abuts a beautiful downtown park of the
same name, originally laid out by the Perot family (apparently no
relation to America's Ross Perot) as its private garden. Cozy
exhibition rooms contain artifacts, including 18th-century Bermuda
cedar furniture that you can examine up close. The living room
retains the original pine flooring imported from the Carolinas.
9:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. weekdays. Free. 441-295-2487.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Caves: Caves are not the first things that come to mind
when you think of Bermuda, but there are several, concentrated in
the Bailey's Bay area of Hamilton Parish. Crystal Caves is a
commercial enterprise, complete with walkways, lighting and a
souvenir shop. Several smaller caves, including two at Grotto Bay
Beach Resort and others at Blue Hole Park, are free and open to the
public. 441-293-0640.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda Government Ferry Service: Boats depart several times
daily from the ferry terminal in Hamilton. We took the
Hamilton-Somerset-Dockyard route ($7.50 round trip, included in our
travel pass) for a waterfront view of the pastel cottages and
buildings that dot the islands like strands of colorful beads. On
the trip back to Hamilton, we learned that our captain was making
his last voyage before retirement. The boat rocked (and veered
slightly off course) as his retirement party took place in the
wheelhouse. 441-295-4506.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset Bridge: Billed as the world's smallest drawbridge, the
32-inch center plank is opened by hand _ just wide enough to allow
a sailboat's mast to pass through. You can see it from the ferry,
which docks nearby at a wharf on the southern end of Somerset
Island in Sandys Parish.
</P>
<P>
   Spittal Pond: Sixty-acre nature park with walking paths and
scenic views of rocky ocean coastline. Twenty-five species of
waterfowl reside here during the winter. Smith's Parish. Open
daily, dawn to dusk. Free.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's Church, St. George: A church has existed on this
site continuously since 1620, allowing it to make the claim of
being the oldest Protestant church in the New World. Sited
impressively on a rise above the town's harbor, the pastel gray
with white trim structure contains numerous items of historical
importance, including a complete William of Orange communion set
from 1697. Graveyards to the rear and sides of the church contain
the remains of some of the island's early prominent families as
well as their slaves. Also buried here, with little fanfare: island
governor Sir Richard Sharples and his top aide, Capt. Hugh Sayers,
both slain in 1973 in Bermuda's only notable case of civil unrest.
The killer, Buck Burrows, was hanged in 1977. 441-297-8359
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished church, St. George: A five-minute walk from St.
Peter's takes you to the skeletal stone and mortar remains of a
church begun in 1864 as a replacement for St. Peter's. But a schism
developed in the congregation and eventually the project was
abandoned. The Bermuda National Trust is working to preserve the
remains.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Fly to Bermuda on a sale fare of $269 round
trip with a 14-day advance purchase. Delta offers one daily
nonstop; connecting service is available on American, Continental,
Northwest and USAirways. Travel must be complete by Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Grotto Bay Beach Resort information: Off-season (Nov. 1-Dec.
26 and Jan. 4-April 12) rooms are $94-$99 per night. From April 13
to Oct. 31, $199-$240 per night. You can add breakfast for $15 per
person per day or breakfast and dinner for $48 per person per day.

passes, taxes, tips, etc., is $230-$240 per person per day during
peak season; $145 per person per day during the off season. Other

 &HT;    Ex-bodyguard goes distance for `Green Mile' role
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 12.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest new star in Hollywood got there the old-fashioned
way. No acting school. No waiting tables. Not one stage appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clarke Duncan, former ditch digger and bodyguard, stands
before you now, bigger than life, as Tom Hanks' co-star in ``The
Green Mile,'' and _ at 6-foot-5 and roughly 300 pounds _ this movie
season's Next Big Thing for one simple gonna-make-you-cry reason:
Mama told him to go do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother _ Jean Duncan _ taught me everything,'' Duncan, 36,
says, sitting in the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta during a recent visit
here. ``She loved movies. She had me reading at an actor's pace in
elementary school. I couldn't just read `See Tom run,' I had to
read it as `See! Tom! Run! Run, Tom! Run!' My mother said that's
called reading with feeling. She said, `When you get to Hollywood,
you're going to read scripts like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan earlier portrayed the leather-wearing, Harley-riding Bear
in ``Armageddon.'' In ``The Green Mile,'' which opened Friday, he
plays John Coffey, a mysterious 7-foot behemoth _ he's big but he's
also afraid of the dark _ sentenced to death row in 1935. Hanks
plays the prison guard who witnesses Coffey's mystical powers and
slowly begins to believe in his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of supporting role Oscar voters have a history of
lapping up. Harold Russell, a disabled World War II veteran who'd
never acted before, won an Academy Award for ``The Best Years of
Our Lives.'' So did the late Haing S. Ngor, a Cambodian who escaped
Pol Pot's regime and starred in ``The Killing Fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has already been nominated for an NAACP Image Award for
``The Green Mile.'' And some are predicting a supporting actor
Oscar showdown between the big, burly Duncan and wee Haley Joel
Osment, the kid who whispers, ``I see ghosts,'' in the box-office
hit ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan whispers, too. Like his character Coffey, the actor has a
bull's appearance, but often speaks with a kitten's mew.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid I related to John Coffey,'' Duncan says. ``I didn't
have a whole lot of friends growing up, and I was the big guy in
class. Kids picked on me a lot, and I was very sensitive. I was
always getting beat up so I stayed away from groups of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on Chicago's South Side, Duncan quit school but he
says he later earned a GED and attended Kankakee Community College
and Alcorn State University in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a ditch digger in Chicago for two years and took
various security jobs before becoming the bodyguard of the producer
of the traveling theatrical show ``Beauty Shop, Part 2.'' Later, he
went to Hollywood and was working as a bodyguard when Ice Cube
offered him a role as an extra in 1995's ``Friday.'' That led to
roles in ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' ``The Players Club,''
``Bullworth'' and, ultimately, ``Armageddon'' with Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing `Armageddon' and Bruce says to me, `Michael,
I've got the role of a lifetime for you.''' It was ``The Green
Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Go buy the novel and prepare,''' Duncan says. ```Get
inside this guy. You're going to audition. I know you can do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   After landing the part, one surprise was not getting to work
out. As a bodyguard, Duncan had amassed 22-inch arms but was still
considered too small for the role. ``Green Mile'' director Frank
Darabont ``wanted me to gain weight, but he wanted it to be a more
natural look.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan also had to learn to share screen time with the movie's
smallest character _ a remarkable little mouse named Mr. Jingles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved working with the little mouse,'' Duncan says. ``It was
so nice and sweet. He would come up your shoulder and he could run
from my hand to (co-star) Michael Jeter's hand. I let him go one
time and he went running and went halfway and turned around and
came back to me. And I'm like, `You don't want to be away from me,
do you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or Mr. Jingles knows where the spotlight's going to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan. Rated R for violence,
language and some sex-related material. 3 hours, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A manipulative but absorbing and deeply satisfying
adaptation of Stephen King's prison novel.

 &HT;    A wacky, eloquent apocalypse unfolds
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a young man says ``au revoir'' to his high school French
teacher (Genevieve Bujold), she corrects him with the more final
``adieu.'' That's because the first farewell implies that they'll
meet again sometime, which is simply not an option in the aptly
named drama ``Last Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the world has inspired Hollywood filmmakers to send
casts of thousands screaming through the streets and to flatten New
York and Paris with special effects. For our neighbors to the north
_ or at least Canadian writer-director-actor Don McKellar _ the
final apocalypse is treated with a dry wit and a sense of decorum
that consciously tweaks that nation's reputation for civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test of our values,'' says one older man, presiding
over a mock Christmas dinner on the eve of The End. His wife has
gift-wrapped childhood toys to redistribute to their grown
children, Jennifer (Sarah Polley) and Patrick (McKellar), and elder
relatives have joined them for a feast. But while the rest of his
family bonds over home movies, Patrick insists on going back to his
flat to be alone during the hours remaining till midnight, when
Earth goes bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   The root of Patrick's antisocial mood is one of several
mysteries gradually revealed in the movie, which interweaves the
stories of a handful of friends and strangers. They include
Patrick's pal Craig (Callum Keith Rennie), busy at his apartment
fulfilling his every sexual fantasy with a revolving roster of
women; Duncan (fellow Canadian director David Cronenberg), a gas
company executive who leaves messages for customers, assuring that
their service will be uninterrupted until the very end; and, most
memorably, Sandra (Sandra Oh), whose attempts to make it home to
her husband are constantly thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar has them crossing paths in an odd urban landscape. It's
a ghost-town Toronto full of memorably desolate images, such as a
girl and her mother (director Atom Egoyan's muse-wife, Arsinee
Khanjian) sitting dazed on an abandoned bus, or Sandra's car,
picked up by a mob and left leaning upright against a lamppost. The
look of the movie matches its tone: amusing but bittersweet. An
occasional mob appears, stirring up chaos, but even at their most
aggressive, they're less threatening than a bunch of Buckhead
partyers wheeling from a late-night binge.
</P>
<P>
   Co-writer with Francois Girard of ``Thirty-Two Short Films About
Glenn Gould'' and ``The Red Violin,'' McKellar's solo work here is
an accomplished balance between deadpan humor and repressed
emotion. It's typical of the movie's sideways approach that we
never learn the nature of the coming cataclysm, or the reason why
the sun never sets, even as the clock ticks close to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's antic but high-stakes tone is summed up in this
exchange: One character says to another, ``I want you to shoot
me.'' The flummoxed fellow replies, ``I hardly know you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the strong ensemble cast, McKellar uses his quietly comical
aloofness to good effect. But the film's standout is Oh, whose
urgent presence gives it its emotional core, providing the
unexpected wallop of the final scene. Simple on the surface, but
cutting deep, ``Last Night'' succeeds in making you wonder what
you'd do if you knew your remaining time could be measured on the
clock. For all its wry humor, it concludes as a heart-piercing
affirmation of life and love in the face of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Oh, Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie and Sarah
Polley. Rated R for sexuality, profanity and brief violence. At
Garden Hills.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A lovely, offbeat look at the end of the world.

 &HT;    `Train' a lively trip to muddled destination
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About the only things missing from ``Train of Life'' are Robin
Williams shouting ``All aboard!'' and Roberto Benigni going ``Toot!
Toot!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's a harsher take than intended, because this
movie is better, in its way, than either ``Jakob the Liar'' or
``Life Is Beautiful.'' Yes, it's another wish-fulfillment comedy
with a Holocaust theme, but it has two things going for it: an
inventive premise and a kick-in-the-gut coda that's straight out of
the Taviani brothers' sublime ``Night of the Shooting Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the audience award at last year's Sundance Film
Festival, ``Train of Life'' begins in 1941 in an isolated shtetl in
Eastern Europe. Rumors of Nazi deportation of Jews are confirmed by
Shlomo (Lionel Abelanski), the lowly village idiot who also, in
many ways, serves as the film's silent narrator. The rabbi and his
counselors are thrown into a panic, but Shlomo has an idea: Why not
create their own deportation train and fool the Nazis into thinking
they're headed for a concentration camp? Some villagers will be
instructed in German and play Nazis. The rest will play, well,
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually an ingenious idea for a picture, a kind of
variation on 1965's ``Von Ryan's Express,'' in which Frank Sinatra
led a group of escaping prisoners of war on much the same
adventure. But filmmaker Radu Mihaileanu too often opts for low
humor and who-cares politics. Sure enough, the villagers designated
to ``play'' Nazis start taking themselves a bit seriously, while
the deportees begin arguing among themselves. Most tediously, a
splinter Communist group emerges to make trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some sublime moments. A run-in with a truck
convoy of faux-Nazi Gypsies trying the same desperate gambit is
worthy of Emir Kusturica. And underneath the farcical shenanigans,
there's an aura of sadness and regret fathered by the film's
you-saw-it-coming-but-you-didn't framework. This is, after all, a
tale told by an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plot is straight out of a ``Hogan's Heroes''
episode, with easily duped real Nazis and clumsy ``Heil Hitler''
jokes. And most of the cast, alas, attack their roles as if they
were rejects from a road company of ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' There
are exceptions _ notably Abelanski, whose fool's dream offers
unexpected resonance, and Rufus as the pretend Nazi officer who
feels all too heavily his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Allegedly, ``Train of Life'' pre-dates ``Life Is Beautiful.'' If
so, Benigni owes Mihaileanu an apology, an Oscar or something. But
even without having its thunder stolen, the picture's embrace of
cuteness over cleverness, of stereotypes over challenges, weakens
it. Here, finally, is a subtitled (it's in French) movie that
Hollywood probably could do better. Maybe someone will try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Train of Life''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lionel Abelanski and Rufus. Directed by Radu
Mihaileanu. Rated R for brief nudity and sexuality. In French with
subtitles. At Tara. 1 hour, 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Often goes off track, but headed in the right
direction.

 &HT;    Tackling big questions in a heart-rending way, mystically
charged `Green Mile' walks the walk
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the makers of ``The Green Mile'' are doing something
right when you find yourself getting teary-eyed over the fate of an
injured mouse. At the same time, you can't quite ignore how
shamelessly, if skillfully, you're being suckered.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, writer-director Frank Darabont struck gold with
Stephen King in his adaptation of ``The Shawshank Redemption.'' Now
he returns to the same author and a similar prison setting,
inflating King's serialized novel into one of those achingly long
prestige films positioned to win end-of-the-year awards. Darabont
has Spielberg-ized the movie, giving it a bookend time frame, and
taffy-pulled its slim plot to run more than three hours. (Darabont
was an uncredited writer on ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which shares
this picture's length and wraparound structure.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package Oscar voters love: It
has period costumes, the kind of burnished cinematography that
screams ``quality,'' a script that flirts with big questions (race,
justice, morality and mortality), a hefty dose of late-1990s New
Age spirituality and, most importantly, Mr. Oscar Bait himself, Tom
Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   There's also this really cute mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, head guard on death row of a Southern
prison in 1935. His cellblock is called ``the Green Mile'' because
of the lime-colored floor the prisoners walk one last time on their
way to Old Sparky, the electric chair. The newest inmate is a pile
of muscle called John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan). Despite his
size, he's a tremulous, childlike thing, scared of the dark; it's
hard to see him as a man convicted of the brutal murder of two
little girls.
</P>
<P>
   The enigma of Coffey's identity is at the core of ``Mile,''
which gradually reveals his supernatural healing abilities. The
movie also spends time with other prisoners, including the
sociopathic Wild Bill (Sam Rockwell) and the calmer Eduard
Delacroix (Michael Jeter), who strikes up a friendship with a mouse
he calls Mr. Jingles.
</P>
<P>
   The real rodent of the movie is neither a mouse nor a prisoner.
It's Percy (Doug Hutchison), a sadistic, sniveling guard despised
by Paul and his colleagues, Brutus (David Morse) and Dean (Barry
Pepper). Percy's fascination with the executions makes Paul
surmise, ``He just wants to see one cook up-close.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly rotten, Percy is an example of the film's main
weakness: overdetermined characters. We spend three hours with
these people, but no one changes, develops, does something
surprising. They remain who they are from first appearance to last,
like characters in a puppet pageant. Coffey, in particular, is
rendered into a mythic emblem rather than a man. (In case you miss
the symbolism, take note of Coffey's initials.)
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, ``Green Mile'' verges on the touchy-feely
territory you get from Robin Williams dramedies. It's so determined
to make you cry that you pretty much have to submit. Otherwise, you
might realize that you've just paid for a manipulative blend of
aw-shucks mysticism, melodrama, socially conscious uplift and
jokes. As unalike as all these elements are, Darabont marshals them
with remarkable skill. The connecting tissue is the melancholy
shadow he casts over the whole movie, a hint of autumn and
inevitable decay that pays off at the end with a poignant
reinterpretation of what ``the green mile'' means. His work is like
a conjurer's trick. You know it's all fake, and it shouldn't work.
But while you're watching, you can't keep your eyes off of it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its mystic main plot, the movie offers ample comic
relief, such as that mouse, or in the discreet depiction of a
bedroom marathon between two spouses whose sexual problems have
been remedied by Coffey's magic hands. Darabont doesn't shy from
the horror, either. The movie's gross-out centerpiece is a
suspensefully built scene of an electrocution-gone-wrong that sends
witnesses scrambling in panic. (It may also make some viewers
reconsider their stand on the death penalty.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie's secret weapon is an impeccable cast. Hanks provides
his patented everyman charm, while Duncan, Jeter and Rockwell all
do sharp work. James Cromwell is touching as the warden, trying to
manage his jail while coping with personal tragedy. And Bonnie
Hunt, usually tapped as comic relief (``Jerry Maguire''), provides
a lived-in sexiness that elevates her small role as Paul's
supportive wife.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tiny roles are superbly cast. Gary Sinise turns up for
one scene as a lawyer. Graham Greene has a blink-or-miss-him part
as another prisoner, while Harry Dean Stanton steals scenes as a
crusty trusty. Patricia Clarkson appears as Cromwell's fading, ill
wife, a far cry from her standout turn as a German junkie in ``High
Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Is ``The Green Mile'' a work of art? Not really. But it's a
superior piece of manufacturing, meticulously crafted, absorbing
and beautifully acted. Folks are gonna love it. Like most of King's
books (even the ones that scare the trousers off you), it's
resolutely square at heart. And it's deeply satisfying, even when
you know it's all a bunch of hokum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt and Michael Clarke
Duncan. Rated R for violence, language and sex-related material. At
metro theaters. 3 hours, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A manipulative but deeply satisfying adaptation of
Stephen King's prison novel.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar potential: Beyond best picture, it could land nods for
director, actor (Tom Hanks), three of its supporting actors
(Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell), adapted
screenplay, score and costumes.

 &HT;    An independent traveler loose in the land of the all-inclusive
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 12.
 &HT;    By James D. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAILEY'S BAY, Bermuda _ The coral blue of the Atlantic sparkled
on the horizon, a perfect backdrop for my icy green margarita with
its bright red cherry. Beach music drifted in on the sea breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Spending a week at the Grotto Bay Beach Resort in this
picturesque British dependency was supposed to ensure I didn't have
to fret the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Everything _ airfare, airport transfers, room, meals, poolside
drinks, even those pesky gratuities _ had been rolled up into one
convenient all-inclusive tab. All I had to do was kick back and
relax.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been easy at this sprawling 21-acre hillside
resort of pastel lodges overlooking its own slice of beach. In
addition to offering afternoon tea, bingo, croquet, tennis,
boating, snorkeling and swimming, the resort even threw in its own
underground caverns for exploration or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Pat, thought this was a perfectly fine way to spend a
vacation _ languishing in the lap of luxury and not lifting a
finger. ``Every vacation doesn't have to be an adventure,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   So why wasn't I having fun?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, my usual style of travel is to jump on an airfare
bargain and make up an itinerary as it happens. That's how we wound
up exploring the ruins of Machu Picchu the previous summer: Cheap
seats to Lima and suddenly I was asking, ``What the heck is in
Peru?''
</P>
<P>
   So, being a frugal traveler, there was the nagging suspicion
that I had probably paid too much for the convenience of having
someone else put all the pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for time _ the usual demands of work, plus a house on
the market and a job change looming for Pat _ we went for a
vacation ``off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the horror stories we had heard about triple-digit
dinners for two at not-necessarily-special restaurants in Bermuda,
and the lure of locking in our costs became more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help matters much, therefore, when I later discovered
room rates on the Web that apparently beat those in our package.
And it added insult to injury when airfares to Bermuda went on sale
shortly before our departure.
</P>
<P>
   But we had opted for the security of knowing that everything was
taken care of and that we wouldn't be in for major financial
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem, however, was that after a couple of days at
poolside, I felt tied down.
</P>
<P>
   For me, going the all-inclusive route was like dining at an
all-you-can-eat buffet: To get your money's worth, you had to hang
out near the food tables and be ready to pounce when new items were
brought out. It's all about quantity, not necessarily quality.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking was the sense of accomplishment we had felt from
discovering a quiet neighborhood cafe on a snowy street in Vienna,
Austria, over Valentine's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Dining night after night in the same surroundings got old fast _
even though we didn't have to sit at the same table with the same
tablemates as you might do on a cruise. It didn't help that the
staff at Grotto Bay did a masterful job of varying the menu. It was
still the same setting, the same faces.
</P>
<P>
   Though our resort wasn't a gated compound, it was located far
enough from the towns of St. George and Hamilton that casual
contact with locals, other than resort staff, was unlikely. And,
from the mostly American channels on the room TVs to the absence of
local newspapers in the gift shop, the intent seemed to be more at
helping visiting Americans ``feel at home'' than giving us a feel
for Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it felt much more like being in Florida than in a
separate country with its own history and culture. I itched to get
out, to explore.
</P>
<P>
   By our third day, we were using our Bermuda bus passes (included
in the package) and venturing out on day trips. Although the
resort's luncheon fare was average at best (hot dogs, hamburgers,
chicken nuggets, fish sandwiches or tossed salads _ which Pat
thought were quite good), it irritated me that we were paying extra
whenever we ate meals elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   We also missed out on many of the ``free'' activities that were
part of resort life: nature walks, feeding the fish, volleyball and
shuffleboard competitions. But these were all items that we could
just as easily have done on our own at our own convenience.
</P>
<P>
   An added complication in Bermuda is that you can't rent a car,
which means you have to rely on public transit, taxis or motor
scooters for getting around. Since bus passes were included in our
package, I certainly wasn't about to pay extra for scooters (they
didn't seem a particularly safe mode of transit, either) or taxis.
</P>
<P>
   So, the next time I'm tempted by the lure of an
``all-inclusive'' resort, I'll explore other options. For example,
some resorts offer plans of one, two or three meals a day that
don't lock you into doing all your dining at one site.
</P>
<P>
   Another twist is a dinner plan that allows you to sample the
cuisine at other participating resorts. At least that way, you're
not looking at the same decor and dining companions for your entire
stay.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was one aspect of having spent a week at an
all-inclusive resort that I thoroughly enjoyed: checkout.
</P>
<P>
   There was no tab to tally, no scrutinizing the bill, no pulling
out a calculator to verify that everything added up just right.
</P>
<P>
   Just a smile and a ``hope you enjoyed your stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's something to write home about.

 &HT;    Georgia girl finds Ghana liberating
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMASI, Ghana _ Amid the jumble and clutter of Kumasi, Ghana's
second-largest city, and far, far from the trim lawns of Marietta,
Ga., Anna Mozley feels free.
</P>
<P>
   Anna is 10, the same age as my daughter Jennifer, and Jennie and
Anna used to be best friends. For five years Anna lived in
Marietta, three houses down the hill from us.
</P>
<P>
   Battleview is a clean and quiet neighborhood, orderly and
suburban, bordering the trails and fields of Kennesaw Mountain
National Battlefield Park. Anna and Jennie attended the same
school. Jennie played at Anna's house all the time, and Anna spent
a lot of time at our house, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in August, Anna's parents, Mike and Claire, moved to Ghana
to work as missionaries. They swept up Anna, her 6-year-old sister,
Maggie, and their year-old brother, Luke, and moved them off to the
dust and smell and bustle of this teeming African city of 2.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might wonder what kind of parents would yank their
daughter out of a good school, away from the whispering pines and
backyard pools, to sit at rude tables in small classrooms and walk
the rutted roads.
</P>
<P>
   Good ones. I hold different beliefs than do Mike and Claire, but
I know of no finer parents anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take my word for it, though. Walk with Anna, as I did,
down some of these roads. See the shine in her eyes. Hear the
excitement in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a person that wanted adventure, wanted
Africa, wanted forests, wanted monkeys,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has seen the forests and fed monkeys from her hand. She
lives in Africa. And she's happy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it has all been easy. There was a time, early on, when
she cried every night. She missed her family. Her grandmother, two
aunts and eight cousins all lived within 30 minutes of her home in
Marietta, and Anna had left that circle.
</P>
<P>
   The unfamiliar odors of Kumasi assaulted her _ the burning
rubbish, the body odor in the marketplace, the sewage that
sometimes runs down street gutters.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty shocked her. She wanted to give away everything she
owned. She did give one girl a special bracelet that a friend in
Georgia had given her as a going-away present.
</P>
<P>
   And she misses my Jennie. ``A lot,'' she said. ``A lot. That was
the hardest. That neighborhood had been home forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A RESPECT FOR CULTURES
</P>
<P>
   We turned a corner and walked up a dusty hill to a tiny shop.
</P>
<P>
   For all the difficulties, Anna has found rewards in Ghana,
deeper ones than patting monkeys on the head. She did that only
once, at a sanctuary in the northern part of the country, far from
Kumasi. The richer rewards are those of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at the shop but, to Anna's dismay, it was out of
FanIce. She had wanted me to taste her favorite treat, creamy ice
cream you suck out of a plastic packet.
</P>
<P>
   Stores here run out of things. And no one store has everything;
there's no Kroger where you can do all your food shopping and no
department store where you can find everything else. A long search
one day through the stalls of an outdoor market resulted in only
one purchase _ yes! _ plastic hangers! The family felt exhilarated.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping here is inconvenient. And it's one of the rewards, too.
</P>
<P>
   You get used to things and you discover the best places to shop.
There is a warren of roadside produce stands not far from the
Mozleys' house that they refer to as Harry's Farmers Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best thing is just being able to walk,'' Anna
said, ``and walking to the closest store. In America, I'd ask my
mother, `Can I walk down to the store and get a FanIce?' And she'd
say, `I can drive you to Kroger and get a popsicle.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, it would be paved roads and a supermarket. Here, I
feel more close to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun poured down. We walked up the street toward another
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months here have changed Anna. She no longer notices
the smells, no longer notices the goats that cross the road at
random or the chickens that crow about nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   She is doing well in school; her teacher told me so. There are
good schools, like the one in Marietta, and then there's education.
Anna is learning things in Kumasi she could never learn in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is respect for other cultures. Americans like to
think of themselves as among the most advanced people on earth, but
they can be among the least worldly. Someone who has lived overseas
as a child can never grow up thinking the only valid customs are
American ones.
</P>
<P>
   CHOICES AT EVERY TURN
</P>
<P>
   Anna has learned, too, that happiness does not depend on wealth.
People who live in huts laugh every bit as much as those in
mansions. One time she noticed a bunch of kids singing and dancing.
And it dawned on her: They didn't have nice clothes. They didn't
even have any music.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dancing,'' she said. ``They're singing. They're having
a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun sank low, chased away by the cool of evening. Anna and I
paused at an intersection, looked around to decide which way to go
and decided to amble home.
</P>
<P>
   On such a day, at such an intersection, a realization came over
Anna: She could take any road she chose. It was up to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm free,'' she thought.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Anna how she would look back on this experience 15 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years?'' she exclaimed. ``I want to be in Ghana for 30
years!''
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy Kumasi, Anna. It's a wonderful experience for a kid. But
come back after a few years. This country needs people like you.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, sweetheart, Jennie misses you, too. A lot.

   SCULPTURE-CITY (subslug) (In the Nevada Desert) _ Michael Heizer
doesn't want you to know where he lives, just that he's in the
middle of nowhere in the middle of Nevada. Heizer has just
completed the first phase of his sculpture ``City.'' The structures
_ which he calls ``complexes,'' using a term archaeologists use for
buildings at ancient sites _ are massive concrete and dirt
mastabas, rectangles with sloped sides. What now exists of ``City''
has got to be one of the most massive modern sculptures ever built.
After nearly 30 years, Heizer has passed the first stage toward
completing what is essentially his own Chichen Itza in the desert.
There are four stages more to go. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).

   GREEN-MILE-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``The Green Mile'' will open on
Friday in theaters across the country. Directed by Frank Darabont,
whose first film, ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' drew seven Academy
Award nominations in 1995, it is also based on a Stephen King story
and also set in a prison. In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a Death
Row prison guard in the 1930s who comes to believe that one of his
prisoners, a gentle and somewhat dim giant played by Michael Clarke
Duncan, has supernatural healing powers and may, in fact, be a kind
of angel. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).

   AMADEUS-THEATER (London) _ ``My tongue is stupid, but my heart
isn't,'' remarks the errant genius Mozart in ``Amadeus.'' And a
sprightly genius he proves to be, too, in Peter Shaffer's
metaphysical melodrama, which combines speculative historical
musings with a meditation on divine injustice. Shaffer's play, a
revival, will open Wednesday at the Music Box Theater on Broadway.

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN-OPERA (New York) _ Following the Metropolitan
Opera's ups and downs is a prime entertainment for any music-loving
city dweller. Though many call the house's vision dull, its
week-by-week operation offers plenty to chew on. Wagner's ``Tristan
und Isolde,'' now near the end of its limited run, has been a
considerable success. Assembled were Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner,
two principals who represent the present and the future of an opera
notoriously hard to cast. With them was one of the important Wagner
conductors of the century, James Levine, and a pit orchestra as
good as any in the world. Levine's ``Tristan,'' like much of his
Wagner, is very slow, but it was salutary to surrender to a
different point of view and follow it to a conclusion: a trip worth
taking. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   GRAMMOPHON-CENTENARY-MUSIC (Undated) _ For good reasons,
Deutsche Grammophon's Centenary Collection is heavily concentrated
in the decades after World War II, a period including the history
of the LP and the boom time of the CD. &UR;  &LR; In these years, recording
fidelity started from a high plateau and generally climbed, and
political and social side issues gradually fell by the wayside. The
performers are now better known if not necessarily more
distinguished. &UR;  &LR; Much of the material here will be familiar to
collectors of my postwar generation. By James R. Oestreich.

   LAS-VEGAS-OPERA (Las Vegas) _ What news on the Rialto?
</P>
<P>
   Since spring, they've finished construction on the bridge and
filled the Grand Canal; a few blocks down, a new Paris has its
Opera, Eiffel Tower and Hotel de Ville; and ``O'' has spoiled me
for ``The Ring.'' Greetings from Las Vegas, self-styled
Entertainment Capital of the World, where I have lately landed to
contemplate new frontiers for opera: opera, for the purposes of
this discussion, standing for something greater than itself.
Somewhat to the surprise of observers unattuned to the cyclical
rhythms of cultural history, an art form that within the lifetime
of composers now near their prime was being written off as a
moribund anachronism is experiencing something like a renaissance.

   SCYTHIANS-ART (San Antonio, Texas) _ The story of the Scythians,
how they lived, died and were buried with the things they coveted _
gold, jewels, armor and pottery _ is told in ``Gold of the Nomads:
Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine,'' an exhibition of 171
objects here at the San Antonio Museum of Art, through Jan. 30. The
show was organized by the museum and the Walters Art Gallery in
Baltimore, where it moves in March. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MORIYAMA-PHOTOS (New York) _ Daido Moriyama, 61, was everywhere
in New York this fall. The subject of exhibitions at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Japan Society and the Laurence Miller
Gallery; of a handsome catalog on his life and work (from the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and of essays in prominent art
magazines, he has enjoyed scholarly star treatment that no other
Japanese photographer has ever been given in this country. The
reviews were mainly raves. By Richard B. Woodward. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LOAMY-ART (New York) _ If outdoor earthworks are difficult to
preserve, an ``interior earth sculpture,'' which is how the
conceptual artist Walter De Maria described his 1977 installation
in a Manhattan building, has its own upkeep demands. Twenty-two
years ago, De Maria transformed a desirable 3,600-square-foot piece
of SoHo real estate into something useless. ``The New York Earth
Room'' is 250 cubic yards of earth, piled 22 inches deep. Today,
the work has art historical significance and also provides a
welcome respite from the shopaholics on SoHo's crowded streets.
Some 10,000 people visit the piece annually. One can't walk on it _
a glass barrier contains the earth and keeps people out _ but a
loamy smell definitely permeates the space. By William Harris.

   TV-BECKER (Undated) _ ``He's the most flawed character I've ever
written,'' says David Hackel, proudly, of Dr. John Becker, the
middle-aged lead character played by Ted Danson, the ex-``Cheers''
matinee idol sitcom star. Becker is a politically incorrect
malcontent with no real counterpart in today's youth-obsessed
sitcom world. Positioned neatly at 9:30 p.m. on Mondays on CBS
behind the hit ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker'' the show
regularly finishes in the Nielsen top 20 and has become what
Hackel, 51, a veteran sitcom writer and producer, a bit nervously
calls a ``stealth'' success. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-WB (Undated) _ For three years running, the WB television
network has been the favored child of Madison Avenue ad buyers,
media types and teenage-girl America. A trio of freshman shows are
doing well: ``Popular,'' ``Roswell'' and ``Angel,'' the last an
offshoot of WB's flagship, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Of course,
none of the new shows have gone above No. 107 in the ratings, but
by WB standards they're hits. Each of the three has growing buzz
and critical support. Each is set in the present day in one of
three WB preferred locations: high school, college or
flunky-job-early-stage adulthood. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).

SERBIAN COURT SENTENCES KOSOVAR ACTIVIST TO 12 YEARS IN PRISON  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A Serbian court sentenced Flora Brovina,
Kosovo's leading poet and a noted campaigner for women's rights,
Thursday to 12 years in prison on charges of terrorism committed
during the NATO air campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brovina, 50, a pediatrician, headed the Albanian League of
Women in Kosovo and ran a clinic for women and children. She was
arrested in April in the Kosovar capital, Pristina, at the height
of the NATO bombing and has been detained ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Accused of aiding the separatist guerrilla movement, the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which was fighting Serbian forces in the province,
she is the most prominent political prisoner among the nearly 2,000
Kosovar Albanians now in Serbian prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brovina made a moving appeal in her defense Thursday. ``As a
humanitarian and a poet, it was my duty to join in the emancipation
of Albanian women in Kosovo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a reference to the climate of revenge that is engulfing
Kosovo, she said: ``I dedicated all my life to children who do not
know they have a nationality until their parents tell them. I am
sorry I am in jail because I cannot help to have an influence or
help displaced people return to their homes and to influence Serbs
and Albanians towards reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights
representative in Serbia, who attended the trial in the Southern
Serbian town of Nis, described Ms. Brovina as dignified during the
reading of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her closing statement was very moving,'' Ms. Davis said. She
quoted Ms. Brovina as saying: ```I regret the prosecution has so
minimized the role of women in the world. I have been accused of
wanting to change borders and unite Kosovo and Albania. My poems
have been translated into Serbian, and many other languages and for
me my homeland is where my poetry is read.'''
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the sentence shocked lawyers and human rights
representatives attending the trial. They had hoped to see a much
more lenient sentence, and said that the prosecution had produced
little evidence to support the charges.
</P>
<P>
   At the first hearing last month, Ms. Brovina spoke in her own
defense and described her activities in Kosovo as purely
humanitarian, helping women and children and trying to raise health
standards. She also stressed her anti-war activities, such as
organizing peace marches.
</P>
<P>
   But at the trial Thursday the prosecution suddenly moved to
change the indictment and raise the severity of the charges, Ms.
Davis said. ``The new charge was based on her undertaking
activities for the Kosovo Liberation Army during the NATO
bombing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, Ms. Brovina said she had been sick with angina
at the time and semi-paralyzed and thus incapable of helping the
guerrilla movement. She pointed out that when she was arrested
outside her apartment in Pristina, the police allowed her to
retrieve her heart medicine from her home.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution then produced as testimony a 10-page statement
signed by Ms. Brovina while in police custody in Pristina. Ms.
Brovina said she had never been allowed to read the statement and
denied the contents.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been interrogated 18 times after her arrest,
usually from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., during which time she was neither
fed nor allowed to rest, and was moved from house to house during
the NATO bombing. ``I was completely exhausted and in such a
condition that I would have confessed to anything,'' she said in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her treatment by police, she said, ``I am grateful
that they only hit me once.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms Davis said that ``We worked out she underwent 226 hours of
interrogation, deprived of food and sleep.'' She added, ``I think I
would call that `under coercion,''' referring to Ms. Brovina's
statement made in custody.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic, of the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center,
said the evidence produced in court had not been enough to support
such a sentence. ``It was a political trial, she was punished as
revenge for being an activist during the NATO bombardment,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kandic called for an amnesty for all Albanians imprisoned in
Serbia, saying that the sentence Thursday was a step backwards for
the country and that the authorities were clinging to a pretense
that they still had jurisdiction over Kosovo.

THE GOOD LIFE OF COLONIAL PENNSYLVANIA ON EXHIBIT IN PHILADELPHIA
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa. , Britain)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Worldly Goods: The Arts of Early Pennsylvania, 1680-1758,'' a
path-breaking exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art through
Jan. 2, is an ambitious show, with more than 350 examples of
furniture, textiles, silver, metalwork, ceramics and paintings that
were either made in or imported to the colony.
</P>
<P>
   The diverse objects are arranged in handsome room settings, to
show how the furnishings would have been assembled at the time, as
well as in displays where similar products made in different places
can be compared.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the relationship between the decorative arts and
society is perhaps the best way to understand the significance of
these works of art, because they reveal the aspirations and habits
of the people who produced them.
</P>
<P>
   The show attempts to correct some misconceptions about the early
Philadelphia Quakers and how they lived. The Quaker leaders, at
least, did not live modestly but in splendor. If they wore gray, it
was gray silk. If they used porringers, they were often silver
instead of pewter.
</P>
<P>
   From 1681, when Charles II of England granted William Penn the
charter for Pennsylvania, to the mid-18th century, the region grew
from a sparsely populated Dutch and Swedish settlement into a
large, sophisticated mercantile community led by English Quakers.
Penn lured tens of thousands of English and European immigrants to
the colony with his promises of religious freedom and personal
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania was a very distinctive place, the scholar Richard
S. Dunn writes in the exhibition catalog, because it was the only
British colony in America founded on truly visionary principles. It
was the only pacifist colony, with no armed forces or military
defenses, and it was the only colony committed to peace with the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Lindsey, curator of American Decorative Arts at the
Philadelphia Museum, explained why he organized the ``Worldly
Goods'' show. ``Most of what has been written is about the 1760s,
the Revolutionary War period and after,'' he said. ``I wanted to
examine the tradition of early patronage in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey traces the development of the arts in Philadelphia and
the surrounding Colony of Pennsylvania (which included part of what
is today Delaware and New Jersey). First he tracked the colony's
phenomenal growth. In 1681 four ships arrived with 1,200 people. By
1690 there were 3,000 people. By 1705 the population was 8,000; by
1720, 45,000. By the 1720s Philadelphia was the second biggest city
in the colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Penn did not stay in the colony for long, but it thrived without
him. Philadelphia had everything it needed to be a mercantile
community, Lindsey said: good land, a tidal river and a deep port.
It had oak to build ships, excess wheat and livestock, and an
industrious populace. The Quakers were conservative, savvy business
people who saw the colony as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's first major wharf, which was 300 feet long, was
built in 1681. By 1690 there were 30 such wharves, Lindsey noted.
The city's merchants would go to Jamaica and Barbados and sell
grain, flour and preserved pork. There they bought rum, sugar and
mahogany and sailed to England, where they bought textiles, fine
furniture, silver and porcelains to sell in the colonies.
</P>
<P>
   It was an enormously lucrative system. Ships could sell their
contents and realize a seven-to-one profit, Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Many objects in the show _ embroidered textiles, silver
services, fancy case goods _ are from private collections and have
never been exhibited before. Other objects have been borrowed from
local house museums, each of which has been making a special effort
on its tours to point out what has been has lent to the museum and
why it is important.
</P>
<P>
   These house museums include Wyck, which is considered
Philadelphia's oldest standing house (from 1690); Cliveden, the
Chew family's stone summer retreat and the site of the
Revolutionary War Battle of Germantown in 1777; and Stenton, an
early Georgian brick house built in 1723 by James Logan, William
Penn's personal secretary in 1699. All are just a short drive north
of the museum, in the Germantown section of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog says that by 1690 Philadelphia already had a
reputation as a good place for artisans to find work. Most
emigrated from Europe, some from colonial ports like Boston or New
York. Lindsey found records of 172 woodworkers active between 1730
and 1761. He said there were 60 silversmiths there by 1740.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania was the fastest growing colony in 18th-century
North America, Dunn writes. The Scotch-Irish came from northern
Ireland, the Catholic Irish from southern Ireland and the Germans
from the Rhine region. More than 40,000 Germans and 30,000 Irish
sailed to Philadelphia between 1726 and 1755.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be plenty of work. All the immigrant groups
farmed and worked in shipbuilding. The Germans wove linen and wool
and became ironsmiths. The highly trained French Huguenots, who
fled France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685,
fashioned Baroque-inspired silver services.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity and expansion set the stage for widespread support of
the arts at almost every level of society, Lindsey writes in the
catalog. The desire for stylish luxuries fueled the demand for
imported goods and inspired both urban and rural artisans to
develop the skills to rival foreign craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers' ingenuity was impressive. Caspar Wister, a German
immigrant who was friendly with Benjamin Franklin, opened a brass
button factory in 1717, then created a glassworks in 1739. In 1730
William Branson established a furnace to make cast-iron stoves and
firebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture makers apprenticed with English-trained cabinetmakers
from Boston or London. They learned how to combine fancy mahogany
from the West Indies with local, humbler woods like poplar, cedar
or pine. They made document boxes, spice boxes, chests for
textiles, high chests, dressing tables, tea tables and, eventually,
tall case clocks.
</P>
<P>
   There were few makers of ceramics. Potters made red ware for
cooking and storage vessels, as well as some stoneware; but as
Lindsey put it, ``None of the local productions threatened
England's supremacy in the American market.'' He added that Dutch,
English and Chinese ceramics ``probably made up the majority of the
early imports.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition shows how families combined homemade goods with
prized imports, like books, globes, charts and measuring
instruments. An even better way to appreciate the complexity of
their lifestyle is to see the exhibition in the morning, then visit
Wyck, Cliveden and Stenton in the afternoon. Then you, too, will be
tempted to say, ``On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.''

MANY ISSUES ON THE AGENDA AT EUROPEAN UNION CONFERENCE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ European Union leaders gathered here
Thursday for a summit conference aimed at reforming and reshaping
their organization, but the start of the two-day meeting was
distracted by alarm over the Russian assault on Chechnya and a
sudden outbreak of quarrels among member nations.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is a significant one for the 15-nation bloc, with
the agenda including the likely creation of a European defense
force, agreement on expansion to as many as 28 members and clearing
the path for Turkey to realize its deeply felt ambitions to join.
</P>
<P>
   The Helsinki gathering was also once envisioned as a way of
improving the European Union's relations with Russia by
capitalizing on Finland's role as a bridge between Moscow and the
West. But that objective has been overtaken by recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the eve of the conference were anxiety over the
continuing Russian offensive in Chechnya, anger by Britain at the
refusal of France to accept British beef, and a dispute between
Germany, France, Britain and Luxembourg over a plan to withhold a
20 percent tax on savings and investments.
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said he would seek
to move the Russian attack on Chechnya to the top of the agenda,
saying, ``We cannot discuss the other issues _ which are very
important, but mainly in the long term _ without dealing with this
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Lipponen, the prime minister of Finland, the current
president of the European Union, said the conference should decide
to apply financial as well as political pressure on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The withholding tax proposals, championed by Germany and France,
were aimed at clamping down on tax dodgers and tax havens within
the 15-nation union. But Britain complained that the taxes would
trigger an exodus of money and jobs from the huge London-based
Eurobond industry. Luxembourg, where many nonresidents invest their
savings tax-free, said it was firmly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission and Finland presented a compromise that
would allow Britain to avoid imposing the tax as long as it
notified home countries of their citizens' investments, but the
British withheld official comment on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair was not reluctant to comment on
learning Wednesday night that France was continuing to refuse
British beef in defiance of the European Commission's decision in
August to lift its ban. It was imposed three years ago after the
outbreak of mad cow disease in British herds. Blair telephoned his
French counterpart, Lionel Jospin, to tell him he had delivered a
``totally wrong'' verdict.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether the dispute can be moved onto the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of increasing membership in the union, Latvia,
Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Malta are slated to
join Estonia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia and
Cyprus, which are countries already accepted for membership. It
will take at least three years for the first fully approved nations
to become formal members, and more years than that for Turkey, even
if it succeeds in adding its name to the list this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a strategically placed country and a member of NATO,
but it will have to improve its human rights record and accept
political and economic reforms if it is to join the rich Western
club. A vote on Turkey's aspirations must be unanimous, and Greece,
the sole opponent, has signaled willingness to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, was an early arrival
in Helsinki, seeking the agreement of Finnish officials to link
acceptance of Turkey with an agreement by the Turks to solve their
territorial disputes with Greece through the International Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   For Finland, this meeting completes its first tenure as European
Union president _ the final step in its march to acceptance by the
nations at the continent's core after decades of Cold War
marginalization at Europe's fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Finland joined the European Union only five years ago, after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 liberated it from the
diplomatic tightrope it was obliged to walk in its dealings with
its northern neighbor and former ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish president, used his country's
linkage to Russia to become a key mediator in the dispute between
Russia and the West over the bombing of Yugoslavia. Lipponen tried
to carry that mission forward with a project called the Northern
Dimension, but it has died under the weight of the Russian
offensive in Chechnya.

WISE GUY'S BLUES IN `WITNESS PROTECTION'
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Embargoed until Saturday, Dec. 11. Fact box at bottom.) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dramatically speaking, ``Witness Protection'' is an odd bird.
It's most fascinating in its procedural, by-the-books depiction of
the process through which families who deliver state's evidence are
transformed into completely different entities and shipped off to
completely different environs. But the film also feels the
obligation of providing a semblance of human drama, as well, and
that's where it feels indistinct and formulaic.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by feature filmmaker Richard Pearce (``The Long Walk
Home,'' ``No Mercy''), the movie wastes little time taking off _
mobster Bobby Batton (Tom Sizemore, who plays seedy tough guys as
well as anybody) is almost iced in his home. Once he gets wise to
the fact that it's his own side trying to do him in, he has little
recourse but to turn himself in to the Feds and give up his boss
for a murder. ``I'm not a snitch,'' he insists, but when the choice
is snitch or get snuffed, well, turns out he's a snitch after all.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby and his family _ wife Cindy (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)
and two kids _ throw their lives into seven suitcases and are
transported to a high-security flophouse. There, they are given a
mere five days to assimilate reams of information that will help
them assume new, blander identities in a new, safer town (Forest
Whitaker gives a nicely understated, subtly eccentric performance
as the U.S. Marshal who preps them for their new lives). That means
Bobby's going to have to get a real job for the first time since
high school, and it won't pay squat. That means his wife isn't
going to be getting those manicures she likes so much anymore. That
means his son's stellar high school record is for naught _ he won't
be getting into Harvard under his new moniker.
</P>
<P>
   The set-up is endlessly more fascinating than the pay-off. The
requisite conflicts fill the air _ Bobby's wife and son virulently
square off against the family's resident provider and snitch. While
in real life, tensions in such families simmer before exploing, the
confrontations here feel manufactured, and what's supposed to pass
for a hopeful conclusion is simply limp. Sizemore and Whitaker keep
things interesting, but one can't quite shake the feeling that a
more compelling approach to such inherently interesting material
could've been found. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``Witness Protection.''  &QL; 
What: Drama about the government's transition of a mob family
turning state's evidence into anonymous pillars of some other
society. &QL; 
The stars: Tom Sizemore, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Forest
Whitaker. &QL; 
Where: HBO. &QL; 
When: 8 p.m. Saturday; also Tuesday, Thursday, Dec. 19 and 24 and
Jan. 3 and 11 &QL;

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Multiple Mysteries
</P>
<P>
   A Cezanne still life with an unusual past sold for $29.3 million
on Tuesday night at Sotheby's in London. ``Pewter Pitcher and
Fruit'' (1888-90) was stolen 21 years ago from Dr. Harry Bakwin, a
child psychologist in New York who was a major Cezanne collector.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was recovered recently after Lloyd's, the London
insurance exchange, approached the Art Loss Register, an
international database for stolen and missing art and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lloyd's got a vague inquiry from someone who wanted
information about the cost of insurance for shipping the painting
from one country to another,'' said Julian Radcliffe, chairman of
the Art Loss Register in London. He said he did not know who made
the initial inquiry or who stole the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the police or the FBI know,'' he said. ``Even if
they had found out, they couldn't make an arrest,'' because the
seven-year statute of limitations for such thefts had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is saying exactly how the painting was recovered, but
once it ended up with members of the Bakwin family, they decided to
sell it. Sotheby's did not identify the buyer, who bid by telephone
through Tobias Meyer, the auction house's director of contemporary
art worldwide. The estimate was $14.8 million to $19.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the painting one of the artist's finest still
lifes, but Bakwin's collection was also well known, and that
provenance probably helped drive up the price. Another Cezanne from
the collection, ``Young Italian Woman Leaning on Her Elbow''
(1895-1900), was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles
last week for a reported $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also sold on Tuesday at Sotheby's in London was a group of 25
Picassos _ five oil paintings and 20 works on paper _ that had
belonged to Gianni Versace, the Italian fashion designer, who was
fatally shot in Miami Beach in 1997. Like the clothes he designed,
the paintings are all decorative and brightly colored.
</P>
<P>
   The top seller was ``Young Girl With Boat (Maya),'' a 1938
rendering of Picasso's elder daughter, Maya, dressed in a sailor
suit. An unidentified European collector bought it for $6 million,
far above its estimate of $3.3 million to $5 million. A
three-quarter-length 1938 portrait of Dora Maar, one of Picasso's
mistresses, sold for $5.3 million; its estimate was $6.5 million to
$9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission: 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale was a continuation of what we saw in New York last
month,'' said Melanie Clore, deputy director of Sotheby's in Europe
and head of its Impressionist and modern department in London.
``Many of these works, like the Cezanne, had not been seen for 20
years. It's a discriminating group of buyers. They know what
they're buying, and they don't go crazy.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asia in Midtown &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Christie's moved into its new Rockefeller Center
headquarters in May, its old home at 502 Park Avenue, at 59th
Street, has seemed eerily empty. But in January that will change,
at least for 18 months. The Asia Society is renting the building
while its headquarters at 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street,
undergoes a major renovation and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Calling its 59th Street quarters Asia Society Midtown, the
institution plans a Feb. 1 opening for its first exhibition there,
``Spiritual Perfection: Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Sculpture of South
and Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Platt, president of the society, said it had done
minimal work on the old Christie's space, which came with
ready-made galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the society's uptown home, however, are extensive,
involving a $30 million expansion designed by the New York
architect Edward Larabee Barnes. To oversee the project, the
Society chose Bartholomew Voorsanger, the Manhattan architect who
built the garden court for the Pierpont Morgan Library in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a competition but rather brought in a group of
architects to consult,'' Platt said. ``We began with a list of 30
architects, which we narrowed down to 7, then to 3.'' Voorsanger
was chosen because of his experience with the Morgan, Platt said.
</P>
<P>
   Voorsanger's design will double the public and exhibition space
and create galleries on the second and third floors. With its
expansion the society will be able to put its prized Rockefeller
Collection of Asian Art on permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   The first floor will have a redesigned entrance along with a new
glass-enclosed garden court with skylight, sculpture, plantings and
a cafe. The garden court will also be used for special events.
</P>
<P>
   At first plans called for the atrium to be 40 feet high, with an
additional entrance on 70th Street and banners there along with a
glass canopy. But residents on the quiet block of 70th Street
between Park and Lexington objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This block has often been referred to as `block beautiful,'''
said Barry Schneider, chairman of Community Board 8, which oversees
the neighborhood. ``The major thing was the atrium, which residents
felt was obtrusive. But this has turned out to be community
interaction at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was changed after Asia Society officials met with their
neighbors. The atrium height was lowered to 24 feet, and plans for
an entrance on 70th Street were dropped, along with the banners and
the canopy. ``The interaction yielded a better project,'' Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is to begin on Jan. 3 and to be completed by the
fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Frick, to Go &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Frick Collection who don't have time to take its
entire three-hour Acoustiguide can now buy a guidebook based on it.
Available in English, French and German, the book costs $19.95 at
the museum shop.

JAPAN DROPS ROCKET PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the latest setback for the Japanese space program,
the space agency said Thursday that it would abandon its troubled
H-II rocket project, the cornerstone of the program, after a series
of costly failures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will delay the launchings of almost all Japanese
satellites for about a year and follows the failed launching last
month of the No. 8 H-II rocket, which plunged into the Pacific
shortly after takeoff because of engine trouble. In developing the
rocket, Japan sought to free itself from the restrictions that came
with relying on the United States for rocket technology, and to
compete in the commercial satellite-launching market.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Space Development Agency said it would
immediately halt production of the No. 7 H-II rocket, which is 90
percent complete at a cost of $160 million. The No. 7 rocket, which
despite its designation was the last in the H-II series, had been
scheduled for launching with a communications satellite next year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it would focus on the next generation of rocket,
H-IIA, which it said would build on past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has invested $4.14 billion in the H-II program, which
began in 1986, including $2.7 billion for development and $180
million for each launching.
</P>
<P>
   An aerospace analyst, Fujio Nakano, said the decision to shift
focus to the H-IIA was a good idea. ``With the past H-II
launches,'' Nakano said, ``we have already accumulated much
valuable information that can be used in designing the new rocket
model. Considering that this is an investment toward the
next-generation rocket technology, 16 billion yen is a small
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   That total equals $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of the space effort was severely damaged on Nov.
15, when the No. 8 H-II rocket, carrying a government satellite,
plunged into the ocean after the first-stage engine stopped firing.
That was the second H-II rocket failure in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The lost rocket and satellite were valued at $340 million. The
agency has not determined the cause of the failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are still investigating the accident, we decided,
considering the cost involved, that we should cancel the No. 7 H-II
and apply the savings and what we learn from the investigation to
ensuring a successful launching of the H-IIA,'' said a spokesman
for the agency, Yasukuki Fukumuro.
</P>
<P>
   Fukumuro said the agency would save $30 million by devoting its
efforts solely to developing the H-IIA, which he said has a more
advanced engine and more power than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had planned the initial H-IIA launching for early
next year. But its debut will be delayed for a year to conduct
additional ground tests, the agency said. The postponement, along
with the cancellation of the No. 7 H-II, will push back the
launching of almost every satellite for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it planned to launch the first and second H-IIA
rockets, which are scheduled to carry a European Space Agency
communications satellite and Japanese military satellite, in the
summer and winter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Fukumuro said if the initial H-IIA launchings were successful,
the agency hoped to transfer the technology to the private sector
to fulfill the long-term goal of launching commercial satellites.
To be competitive, the Japanese plan to offer customers steep
discounts on launchings and build a reputation for reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The highly competitive launching industry is dominated by three
major players, Boeing's Delta rockets and Lockheed Martin's Atlas
rockets, both from the United States, and Ariane rockets made by
Arianespace, the European consortium. Russia and China have small
parts of the market.

 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
wont be doing much New Years Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed Y2K-compliant, other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Thats why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold Wars superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isnt to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles arent attacking Russia _ if thats what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscows computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   We will prevent that from occurring, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jon
Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and theyll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russias
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that its important for the U.S and Russia to
show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team, said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians wont be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain, the
heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russias potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russias missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his nuclear briefcase in the first stages
of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the Russian
armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
hotline communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,'' Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K is
going to manifest itself on New Years Day, said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are extremely remote that there could be
an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,'' it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.''Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called mission critical systems _ those considered essential for
waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be Y2K compliant by the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air Forces
Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Weve checked them, weve rechecked them. Theyre ready, Warren
said.

AN OLD ISSUE THAT'S STILL A FAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 20 years ago, Ronald Reagan tried to
rescue his failing first presidential bid by stirring up passions
over a pending agreement endorsed by three previous presidents that
would hand control of the Panama Canal to the country through which
the canal runs.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan criss-crossed the land thundering, ``We bought it, we
paid for it, it's ours, and we're going to keep it.'' This
irrational jingoistic message gave conservatives a rallying cry in
the 1976 primaries and President Gerald Ford political heartburn.
Although Ford survived the Reagan challenge, he was so damaged by
the canal issue (and his pardon of Richard Nixon) that he was
defeated in the general election by Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter signed two treaties turning the operation of the canal
over to Panama in 1977, and the Senate ratified them by one vote
following an emotional, ideological debate in 1978. President
Lyndon Johnson had agreed to negotiate the transfer in the late
1960s after a bloody rampage indicated anti-U.S. violence might
shut down the waterway; Presidents Nixon and Ford reaffirmed that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a weary treaty supporter, Senate Minority Leader
Howard Baker, who was soundly trashed by conservatives, sighed, ``I
am tired of behaving responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Having caused much of the domestic political fuss, Reagan had no
more use for the issue. Polls showed that most voters who were not
right-wing fanatics accepted the deal as diplomatically necessary
to smooth out relations with Central America and represented no
danger to the principle of U.S. sovereignty. And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan dropped the subject in his 1980 campaign, and when he
became president, it never reappeared. So much for the dire
long-term consequences that he predicted would result after the
proposed ``give-away.''
</P>
<P>
   Alleged fear of the transfer was always a cynical political
ploy. The action itself was not a genuine national security threat.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is back, in the glorified memory of Reagan.
Today's conservatives hope that what almost worked for him in 1976
will work for them today. You'd think they'd move on to something
more currently relevant, but no. That's why they are conservatives
_ they like the old thinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, former President Carter and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will attend ceremonies in Panama marking the
official transfer of the canal to Panama. The event is providing
conservative groups with an irresistible publicity opportunity that
they are already trying to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, (R-Calif.), predicted ominously that a
``communist Chinese regime that hates democracy ... will dominate
the tiny country of Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't this sound familiar? Didn't we hear this apocalyptic
rhetoric about a communist takeover in Nicaragua not so long ago
that led to secret, illegal White House funding of uncontrolled
guerrillas, a huge death toll and an awkward accommodation for
peace when the U.S. stopped funding the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, dear. Let us not do that again.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the perils inherent in this changeover is
even more gruesome than Reagan's. Witnesses, all selected by
Republican critics of the transfer, testified this week before a
House subcommittee that Panama does not have enough military or
police forces to control the territory. They also charged that the
canal will be vulnerable to outside military pressure as well as
criminal activity and that Chinese plotters will keep our ships
from freely passing through.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong company with Chinese connections, Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., has been granted a long-term lease to run the cargo ports at
both ends of the canal. Actually, the company, which also runs
Britain's three largest ports, has already been running Panama's
ports under contract for two years, with no apparent political
impact.
</P>
<P>
   But in some conservative circles the Chinese have replaced the
Soviets as the new communist menace that we must rail against, no
matter what the facts. It is also a way of continuing to pound
Clinton over alleged Chinese spying activities and illegal campaign
contributions and for backing China's membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But this is murky stuff, based on dark suspicions rather than
evidence or even common sense. Many experts say that if China
wanted to sabotage or spy on us, it would not need port facilities
to do so. Nor would it be in China's interest to interfere with use
of the canal since Beijing is its third-biggest user.
</P>
<P>
   Personal connections between the company's leaders and Chinese
investment entities don't prove much of anything either. Former
Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger regularly
advise Chinese clients. There happens to be a business dialogue
going on here, no matter the status of WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Are we scared that Chinese terrorists will plant missiles beside
the waterway or learn our deepest national secrets by bugging us
from a Panama base? Get serious here. Collapse of the Social
Security and Medicare systems _ now that would be a real threat to
the American way of life.

FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH PLAYING ROLE IN 2000 ELECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ Former President Bush is playing a major role
in his son's bid for the Republican presidential nomination, but he
is rarely seen in the campaign and is almost never discussed on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush went on a hand-shaking tour of New
Hampshire cafes Thursday, potential Republican voters such as
William Hunter of Bedford instantly connected with the candidate by
praising his father or his father's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' Bush told Hunter. ``I'm lucky to have him
as a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   But later, at a Goffstown news conference, another man shouted
to ask Bush what he thought of his father's appointment of David
Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Souter's moderate views have been
a disappointment to many staunch conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about my father,'' Bush snapped, but then
attempted to describe for the man how he will pick Supreme Court
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The man repeated his question. ``I'm not going to talk about
David Souter,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While his father's 1989-1993 presidential tenure is an immediate
point of reference for voters across the country, Texas Gov. Bush
never introduces the subject of his father on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush often mentions his mother, Barbara Bush, frequently, making
positive comparisons between her and his own wife, Laura. Barbara
Bush also has made several public campaign appearances for the
governor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the former president has been noticeably invisible. Early
this year, President Bush hosted a low-profile fund-raiser for his
son in Arizona, and he has made some calls to his old supporters on
his son's behalf. But otherwise he has stayed out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Bush made his first presidential debate appearance
Dec. 2 in Manchester, N.H., Barbara Bush made a highly publicized
visit to the presidential campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas.
Former President Bush was fishing in Argentina, but the Texas
governor was overheard saying, ``OK, `bye, Dad,'' into his cellular
phone. A spokeswoman confirmed that the former president had called
his son to see how the debate had gone.
</P>
<P>
   The only oblique reference to his father, however, comes in his
stump speech when he says it is a big step between being governor
of Texas and president, ``but I've had some pretty good training.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience always laughs and applauds at the unspoken
connection to this father. But instead of then mentioning his
father, Bush goes on to recite his record as Texas governor as the
basis of his training and qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep,'' Gov. Bush reprints a
letter his father wrote last year to him and his brother, Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush. The former president in that letter tells his sons
never to fear politically disagreeing with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that the new breed of journalists will have
to find a hook in stories, will have to write not only on your
plans and your dreams but will have to compare those with what, in
their view, I failed to accomplish,'' President Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be hurtful to a family that loves each other. But the
advice is don't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point both of you may want to say, 'Well, I don't
agree with Dad on that point,' or, 'Frankly, I think Dad was wrong
on that.' Do it. Chart your own course, not just on the issues but
on defining yourselves,'' the former president said. ``Read my
lips, no more worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush so far has avoided criticism of his father. After
being heckled Thursday, said he is keeping his father out of his
race because he wants to be judged on his own by voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't I talk about my father? Because I'm (the one)
running for president,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proudly his son. I love him dearly. I'm lucky I have him
as a father,'' the governor said. ``I inherited half his friends
and all his enemies. It hasn't changed for six years.''

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

used, nearly eight years ago. The new one was Volvo's beautiful new
V40, as stylish and handsome as the 240 is dated and homely. The
V40, and its sedan counterpart, the S40, are Volvo's bid to bring
its cars' prices back down to the entry level.

 &HT;    Oil firm reps blast Clinton's price caps
 &HT;    By Mike Elswick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Representatives of the East Texas oil
business, who have been through the worst of times in the past 18
months, took exception to President Bill Clinton's plans to cap
rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration warned Thursday that ``dangerously
high'' oil prices could affect economic growth and said it was
prepared to intervene if costs continue to soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some real concerns about him wanting to intervene in
trying to control prices,'' said Denny Bowles Jr. of Longview,
whose family has oil interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been the last three to four months that we've gotten
to the point where we're gaining back some of what we lost last
year when prices were low.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Backwell, co-owner and president of Mas-Tech Inc. in
Kilgore, said Thursday that current oil prices are a product of
world supply, demand and actions of governments far outside the
control of Clinton and the United States government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When prices were down they threw us to the wolves and blamed
it on supply and demand,'' he said. Blackwell said industry
requests for a national oil policy to help bring stability to the
industry have been ignored for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of you reap what you sow,'' Blackwell said.
``The administration thought as long as we continued to import oil
the price would stay low.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said the American oil market is ``being manipulated by
things we have no control over.'' These include actions by OPEC and
individual countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the oil industry are victims just as much as the layman
consumer. It just happens this time, for once, we have a little bit
more to gain from it,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost 40,000 people out of oil field jobs in the last year,
and I've heard numbers of as many as 120,000, but 40,000 is
probably a good, conservative number.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said the economics of oil staying below $15 a barrel
as it did for much of last year and into early this year were
devastating to the American oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need what's going on now with prices just to get healed up
from what's happened the last 16-18 months,'' he said. ``All we
want is a healthy, steady market _ with an emphasis on steady _ I
don't think there's anyone in the business who's been around very
long who wants to see prices go much higher. But steady would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said the industry lost many oil service companies,
along with oil companies, to the last bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hit the service side of the business hard,'' he
said. Blackwell said the oil industry has not asked for aid like
farmers in order to survive and remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've asked for for the past 10 years is a national oil
policy and no one will listen,'' Blackwell said. Instead, he said,
the government seems to be ``proud'' of the country's rising
dependence on foreign oil.

 &HT;    Another actor turn to politics
 &HT;    By Glenn Evans
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _Television actor Noble Willingham quit his day
job Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced he has laid out the $2,500 filing fee to enter
the race for the District 1 congressional seat from Texas.
Willingham will run as a Republican for the seat held by Democrat
Max Sandlin of Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   No one has filed to challenge Willingham in the March 14
primary. Last May, Longview attorney Brian Hoyle filed as a
Republican with the Federal Elections Commission to run for the
office, but said last week he will not seek the post.
</P>
<P>
   The general election will be held on Nov. 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham, who portrays C.D. Parker on the television show
``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' told supporters at Republican
headquarters in Longview Wednesday that his final episode is the
Christmas show. Writers tentatively plan to have his character win
the lottery and take off to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad idea,'' he said before describing his
departure from the show after seven years. ``We had a mutual deal.
They wanted to know what I thought they should do about it. They
were amenable to me leaving, and they wanted me to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get to what's really important, and that's this.
I wouldn't want to stretch myself too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Willingham contrasted himself with Sandlin as, `` ...about like
daylight and dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin, he said, has veered too far onto the liberal side of
the political spectrum by tying his wagon to that of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Mr. Sandlin get too close to Mr. Clinton?'' Willingham
asked. ``I don't know that. I'd rather be in my position than his.
... I'm on the right side of the continuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the gentleman who is in there right now _ I don't know
where he falls on the left side.''
</P>
<P>
   Willingham said he would return to his California residence this
week, planning to catch the annual dog show in Indio, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the first of the year we're going to hit it running,'' he
said. ``And we're going to hit it hard, and we're going to have
blood in our eyes.''

BUSH CRITICAL OF GORE, CLINTON ON TRADE, GUN ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H _ Presidential hopeful George W. Bush took on the
Clinton administration Thursday, accusing Vice President Al Gore of
ducking the free trade issue during last week's meeting of the
World Trade Organization in Seattle and Clinton of loosely
enforcing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's criticisms on the gun-law enforcement issue were
blunted by Democratic reaction to a Houston Chronicle report that
the Texas Department of Public Safety has for almost four years sat
on information that several hundred felons may be illegally
carrying guns in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate said he believes Gore, a
Democratic candidate, may be avoiding the trade issue because of
his support from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore has been amazingly silent on the issue,
starring in a new movie called `Silence in Seattle,''' Bush said.
``I think he's worried about the political ramifications, but you
need to ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said President Clinton did not do enough to promote free
trade during his visit to the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disappointed by the administration's reluctance to
promote free trade,'' Bush said. ``They weren't forceful as free
traders.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said, ``Al Gore's view on trade has
been widely known. He has always been a proponent of free and fair
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore supports trade agreements that include labor
and environmental protections as part of main trade provisions, not
as side agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to agree with one argument made by protests at
last week's meeting, saying his ``worry is the WTO conducts itself
in too clandestine a manner. It ought to be more open.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent protests broke out in Seattle at the WTO meeting, as
protesters complained about its secret meetings and its emphasis on
trade ahead of worker and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintains that improved economies in Third World countries
will improve workers' lives and pay for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning Thursday in New Hampshire, said Democrats have
tried to take the law enforcement issue away from Republicans and
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as he has done before, accused the Clinton administration
of being lax in enforcing existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to arrest people who illegally carry guns, arrest
people who illegally sell guns. ...This administration has been lax
in enforcing laws, laws on the books,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep the guns out of the hands of people who
shouldn't have them. But one way to make society safer is to
enforce gun laws on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said that prosecutions of
criminal use of firearms had dropped by 46 percent under the
Clinton-Gore administration, according to a report by the U.S.
Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore spokesman responded by taking a jab at Bush over the
Texas guns issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Bush ``ought to spend more time worrying about
felons who are carrying firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said Bush was
hypocritical on the gun issue, following the Chronicle story
Thursday about the DPS's lax enforcement of felons illegally
carrying guns in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hypocrisy reveals the hollowness of his own commitment to
gun safety,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party chief said Bush simply ``parroted'' the
position of the National Rifle Association, which opposes more gun
control laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported Thursday that the DPS obtained the
information about felons and firearms while screening applicants
for concealed handgun licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although felons were denied handgun permits, they could have
broken the law merely by getting gun-safety training at a firing
range. Federal law prohibits felons from ever again possessing
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS didn't refer their cases to federal authorities for
possible prosecution, even though the felons submitted certificates
with their unsuccessful handgun applications showing that they had
completed a gun-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said Bush, who appoints the commission
that oversees the DPS, learned only this fall that the felons'
cases were not forwarded to prosecutors. The information will now
go to officials working on a new state program, Texas Exile,
created by Bush and Texas Attorney General John Cornyn to crack
down on gun-law violators.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Andrew was ``distorting Governor Bush's proven
leadership of strictly enforcing the tough (gun) laws we already
have on the books in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Bush also had signed laws creating weapons-free
zones around schools, holding parents accountable if their children
gain access to firearms and providing automatic detention for
juveniles who illegally carry guns or use firearms to commit a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also signed the concealed handgun law in 1995, his first
year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opened a meeting with law enforcement officers at AnnaDel's
Restaurant by asking for a moment of silence for six Worcester,
Mass., firemen who died in a warehouse fire last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad story that people who put their lives on the line
sometimes lose it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was endorsed by 80 New Hampshire law enforcement officers.
Retired Goffstown Police Chief Stephen Monier said the decision to
back Bush was based on his record of reducing crime, especially
juvenile crime, as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of results that we in the law enforcement
community respect,'' Monier said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to review whether
confessions should always be excluded from trial if a defendant has
not been given a Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact a voluntary confession has been made, the courts
ought to take a good hard look at if that should be admissible,''
Bush said.

   MILWAUKEE _ Many people consider themselves experts on this
city's war on welfare, but few have ridden its highs and lows as
intensely as Michael Steinborn.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he became a caseworker last year, he ran four
blocks through the snow to buy a coat for a freezing client. She
sold it to buy crack. He worked past 1 a.m. to polish another
client's resume. She skipped her job interview. He listened to one
woman reject a work assignment with an indignant explanation: ``I
don't do mornings.'' He listened to another explain how she had
coped with the loss of her welfare check _ by selling her body to
an old man for $50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, once in a while, he sees something that really
surprises him: Clients he thought would never work have gone out
and gotten jobs. ``All the sudden, the little light in their head
goes on,'' he said. ``It almost makes it worthwhile, at least for
that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, Steinborn was an unemployed jack of the
building trades, down on his luck and in need of a job himself.
Improbably enough, he is now one of the system's most popular
caseworkers _ ``my guardian angel,'' a client said _ and a de facto
authority on the nation's most famous welfare experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, personalized casework was supposed to be a hallmark
of Wisconsin's welfare-to-work program, called Wisconsin Works, or
W-2. In practice, most poor people see their W-2 caseworkers as
distant, or even antagonistic, enforcers of unpopular new work
rules. Yet with little formal preparation outside his own
street-smart past, Steinborn, a white man whose clients are mostly
black women, has shown an uncanny knack for earning their trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a brother,'' said Dinah Doty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend,'' said Shelley Block.
</P>
<P>
   ``A blessing,'' said Angiwetta Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A self-deprecating man who can talk at length about his sense of
failure and futility, Steinborn, 31, is not one to see himself
starring in a sunny story of social progress. He took the job in
skepticism (``I thought there was going to be an in-the-streets
revolution.''), graduated to despair (``I thought, I'm not going to
last a week.''), and found himself steeped in resentment (``You're
lied to on a constant basis.'').
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to see Wisconsin Works as Steinborn does _ case by
painful case, 10 hours a day _ is to grow wary of simplistic
efforts to reduce its impact to slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it working?'' he said, repeating the obvious question,
after multiple attempts to deflect it. ``The honest answer is I
don't think we can judge by the people who are in the program now.
We'll know when their kids are working age.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steinborn's experience offers a candid look at the
struggles inside W-2, it is also revealing in a more personal way.
Across the country, the new welfare laws are reshaping not only the
poor, but also society's perceptions of the poor. Steinborn, a man
who has been mulling inner-city poverty virtually all his life, is
an intriguing case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a central-city landlord, he was raised in the same
neighborhood as most of his clients, among them yet apart. He began
chasing tenants for his father's rent when he was 10. He took pride
in never backing down from a neighborhood fight and had his nose
broken three times. The last thing he brought to his new occupation
was a sentimental view of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be a sucker for a sob story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinborn said casework has taught him something he missed
in street fights and lease disputes: the hurt that most of his
clients feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of sadness and a lot of depression in the people
I deal with,'' he said. ``They don't want to be perceived as
vulnerable. But when you cut away the exterior, they're sad _ sad
for themselves, sad for their children, sad that they haven't done
more with their lives. And they're just aching for you to listen _
not necessarily to solve their problem, just to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if I knew this before and chose to forget it, or
if I'm learning it for the first time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   THE COG: FROM COMPUTER LITERATE TO WORLD WISE
</P>
<P>
   Caseworkers were supposed to be the stars of the new system.
``More of the success of Wisconsin Works will ride on the talents,
training and strategic deployment of the new group'' of caseworkers
than on any other aspect of W-2, its designers wrote in their
initial proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned caseworker was seen as a combination teacher,
preacher, friend and cop _ an all-purpose partner to guide poor
parents into jobs. To attract new talent, the state put the program
up for bid, with five private agencies (two commercial and three
nonprofit) winning the contracts in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The vision was more exceptional than it might sound.
Personalized casework all but disappeared from the welfare system
two generations ago, derided by welfare rights advocates as
paternalistic (the poor need money, not advice, they said) and
shunned by budget offices as frightfully expensive. By the late
1960s, the typical caseworker was a clerk, churning out checks to
hundreds of families while knowing almost nothing about them.
</P>
<P>
   W-2 sought to get personal, specifying that each worker serve no
more than 55 families at a time. Yet the role of the caseworkers is
different from that of traditional social workers who stress
education or counseling to their clients. With a focus on immediate
employment, caseworkers try to push as many clients as possible
into regular wage-paying jobs, while assigning others to a workfare
program in exchange for their monthly checks of $673. (Those who do
not attend are supposed to be penalized $5.15 an hour.) To stress
the new get-a-job ethos, the caseworkers have a new name: financial
and employment planners, or Feps.
</P>
<P>
   While W-2 is more personal than the system it replaced, most
caseworkers still function more like clerks than confidants. In
part, that is because most clients are reluctant to disclose
personal problems (like drug abuse or depression), especially to an
authority figure who controls their monthly checks.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this is because relationships are often short-lived.
Cases are assigned geographically, so a client who moves, as the
poor often do, typically gets a new caseworker. And much of the
caseworker's job still involves managing data, not people; they are
largely judged on how well they keep records in a complicated state
computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the Fep was fantastic,'' said Keith Garland, a
manager at Maximus, one of the two commercial companies that run
the program in Milwaukee. ``But I don't know that overall the
system has had the type of people who have fit the bill.''

 MILWAUKEE: the bill.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Garland set out to find a different kind
of caseworker, someone less computer-literate than world-wise,
someone like Steinborn.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Steinborn needed employment planning himself. He
was a 30-year-old, jobless, blue-collar guy with an ex-wife, a
4-year-old son and a pregnant girlfriend. He had dropped out of
college, driven a cab, hung sheet rock, started a business mowing
abandoned city lots and lost it in a fight with his partner. Then
he had sat at home and brooded.
</P>
<P>
   A high school test had predicted he would make a good social
worker, but Steinborn had scoffed. ``I said, `You think I'm going
to be some underpaid, overworked social worker?''' he said. But
over a beer one night, a friend told him that Maximus was hiring,
with annual salaries at nearly $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed five dress shirts from his father and swallowed his
pride in his prior avoidance of desk jobs. ``I needed the money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   THE SUPER WORKER: FROM WALL KICKING TO GLIMMER OF LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   For months, Steinborn had one thought: ``What have I gotten
myself into?'' He had no problem talking across racial or economic
lines. (Both his ex-wife and his girlfriend are black.) But the
policy manual was inches thick, and entering the wrong computer
code could mean a family would not get a check.
</P>
<P>
   He winced at his mistakes and laid awake at night. He dreaded
coming to work so much he kicked a hole in his bedroom wall.
Meanwhile, the caseworker assigned to train him was arrested for
asking clients for kickbacks. (That caseworker was acquitted by a
jury in October.) Steinborn's supervisor caught him filling out an
application for a job cutting plate glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like putting up dry wall,'' he said. ``You're
messing with people's live.''
</P>
<P>
   Then something strange happened. He entered what he now
self-mockingly calls his ``super Fep'' stage. ``I began to think I
could solve everyone's problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When a client dragged her feet in applying for a job, Steinborn
drove her to an interview. (She did not get hired.) When a client
needed child care, Steinborn arranged to meet her son at school and
drive him to a day-care center. (She skipped her training program
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   One day, the mother of a child with cerebral palsy arrived in
his office. By the book, Steinborn was merely supposed to offer her
a list of specialized child-care centers. Instead, he spent three
hours placing calls, until he found a promising lead.
</P>
<P>
   His client never visited the child-care center. But she did
visit a legal aid office, to file a complaint that Steinborn had
failed to appreciate the needs of her child. She dropped it at the
ensuing hearing, saying she had gotten confused. (``I felt sorry
for Michael _ he really did try to help me,'' she said in a recent
interview.)
</P>
<P>
   The planning manual said to teach the poor to solve their own
problems _ to ``empower'' rather than ``enable'' them. Then again,
the theorists had never met the Woman Without a Coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mi-ii-ke!'' she yelled across the office, introducing herself
on the coldest day of the year. ``Mi-ii-ke, I need a coat!''
</P>
<P>
   She stood too close. She talked too loud. He thought she might
be mentally retarded. When a check of clothing programs turned up
nothing, he ran four blocks through the snow and returned from a
thrift store with a $9 coat.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong size, she complained.
</P>
<P>
   He went back and bought another.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong color, she complained.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, coatless again, she told his supervisor that
no one would help her.
</P>
<P>
   Less offended than intrigued, Steinborn spent months listening
to her rambling monologues _ about God, poetry, the Y2K problem _
until he assembled the outlines of her story. She said she had been
reared by a respected church-going family and lowered to
prostitution by drugs. She said she had been sober, though still
poor and addled, nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   When she was faced with eviction, Steinborn arranged a special
grant and found a housing counselor to help her. She cursed out the
counselor and told Steinborn's supervisor she had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Steinborn lost it.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked if she was still smoking crack, she said she had
been clean for three days. ``You told me you hadn't used in two
years,'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   He urged her to seek treatment, and she angrily refused.
Instead, she and her 8-year-old son moved to a homeless shelter,
and her case was transferred to another agency. He saw her once
more, wandering through the office without her front teeth,
pleading with him for a bus pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small part of me knew it the whole time, but my whole heart
really sank into my stomach,'' Steinborn said. ``I felt really
stupid and useless. I felt betrayed, even though it wasn't about
me. I was almost as addicted to helping her as she was to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to go back to dry wall.

 MILWAUKEE: to dry wall.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE SURPRISES: FROM DOWN AND OUT TO WALKING TALL
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to lower his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   With the welfare rolls in Milwaukee down 85 percent, most of the
remaining cases are hard ones. Among his clients, about one in
eight get jobs each month, and most quickly lose them. Success _ at
least the kind of life-transforming success he once hoped to see _
is rare. ``Sometimes I just have to be happy that someone showed
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Steinborn gets discouraged about the game players and
the lies, his girlfriend is even more pessimistic about his
clients. ``For the majority of them, it is a game _ they just don't
want to do anything,'' said Jai Marin, a black woman from a
working-class family who was once briefly on welfare. ``I'd tell
them their sorry selves were always going to be in the gutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Steinborn keeps tacked to his wall a copy of a certificate from
a woman he barely knows, Angiwetta Hills. He spent hours fixing the
computer transfer of her case from another agency, allowing her to
receive her first check in months. Ms. Hills, 23, who was living in
a homeless shelter with two children and a single change of
clothes, surprised him with perfect attendance in a motivation
class, an achievement that is not quite a new life (or even a new
job), but still a morsel of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often that you see someone as down and out as
Angiwetta pull that off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise ran in both directions. Having spent months in
limbo between two agencies, Ms. Hills had not expected to find a
caseworker willing to help. ``He said, `Everything's gonna be all
right, Angiwetta _ you put in your half, and I'll put in mine,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now out of the shelter and at yet another agency, Ms. Hills
dramatized her view of business-as-usual by dialing her new
caseworker's number and handing the phone to a reporter. The
worker's voice mail said, ``Try to call only once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Steinborn had few expectations of Dinah Doty, 23, who
appeared in his office with a scant work history, no high-school
degree, on the verge of having her fourth child. In Ms. Doty's
three-month exemption from the work program after the baby was
born, she often dropped by just to talk. Then one day she walked in
and said she was employed, as a clerk in a homeless shelter. In
this case, Ms. Doty did seem transformed, as few of his clients
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her chin was up, her chest was out _ she was almost glowing,''
Steinborn said.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he contributed nothing _ ``she just did it'' _ but
Ms. Doty disagrees. ``Michael gave me that motivation to get up and
basically open my eyes,'' she said. ``Michael understands where I'm
coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   In that, she may be more right than she knows. After a decade of
mourning his own failures _ in college, marriage and business _
what most surprises Steinborn about his unlikely foray into social
reform is how deeply he identifies with many of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to the desperate part of them, the part that
doesn't even know how you're going to make it to the next day,'' he
said. ``Because I've felt that more than once in my life, and it's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the case he calls his proudest success may
not seem like much. Shelley Block, the woman who did not ``do
mornings,'' is now a part-time bus driver at an after-school
program. Without Steinborn's help, she said, she would not be
working at all.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in his office last January, he encountered a
300-pound woman with a pierced tongue, a tattooed arm and what she
herself calls a ``really bad attitude.'' He took to her right away.
``Everything she says is funny to me,'' he said.``Shelley makes me
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   He coaxed her into a work assignment inside the Maximus office.
Then they talked, all the time: about her daughter and his sons;
her boyfriend and his girlfriend; her past as a gang member and his
as a thwarted entrepreneur. ``I would say, `Michael, I can't
believe I'm telling you this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called him last summer to say her boyfriend had beaten her
and she was too bruised to show her face. Steinborn insisted on
seeing her, and when he did, he delivered the finest
you-are-somebody lecture Ms. Block had ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I can see you behind a desk some day, making sound
money,''' she said. ``He said, `Don't ever let anybody put you
down.' He gave me so much confidence I cried _ I did _ when I
walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Steinborn was in another trough,
experiencing his clients' failures as his own. When he told Ms.
Block he wanted to quit, the pep talk this time was hers. ``I told
him people were depending on him, that he was very good at his
job,'' she said. ``I told him, `Don't quit!'''
</P>
<P>
   Steinborn, the bruised idealist who sometimes thinks he is a
cynic, listened, at least for now. ``I still go back and forth
between, `I can help them change their lives' and `Who am I
kidding?''' he said. ``There's no happy-ever-after as a
caseworker.''

VOLVO V40 WAGON COMBINES VALUE, GOOD LOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Two Volvo wagons shared my driveway recently, about
three feet and 15 years apart. One was considerably shinier than
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The old one _ a silver-gray 240 DL, circa 1986 _ belongs to my
wife. Boxy and funky, reeking of reverse snobbery, her Volvo has
been a loyal and reliable creature since the day we bought it,
used, nearly eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her Volvo has been driven mainly as a local runner, transporting
a pair of boys, countless loads of groceries, bricks, Christmas
trees, shrubbery, a lawn mower, lumber, bicycles, etc. It's been
used as a moving van, pickup truck and dirt-road denizen. It's been
to San Diego twice.
</P>
<P>
   A repaint only partially hides the scars.
</P>
<P>
   The new one was Volvo's beautiful new V40, as stylish and
handsome as the 240 is dated and homely. The V40, and its sedan
counterpart, the S40, are Volvo's bid to bring its cars' prices
back down to the entry level. Starting in the low 20s, they still
offer a high level of sophistication and good driving
characteristics, as befitting a Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   They also bear Volvo's newfound emphasis on distinctive styling.
In recent years, those who once mocked Volvo designers' dependence
on the basic box have been turned around by some of the fine,
streamlined bodies coming from the Swedish stalwart, especially the
lovely C70 coupe and convertible.
</P>
<P>
   The S40 and V40 (S for sedan, V for vagon, I mean, wagon) are
the result of a joint venture between Volvo and Mitsubishi, which
resulted in a shared chassis, some suspension components and a
Mitsubishi automatic transmission. The relationship was cemented
before Ford Motor Co. acquired Volvo last year. Mitsubishi sells
its own version of the 40, though not in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi influence apparently was required to help Volvo
keep its costs down. The completely loaded-up V40 I drove came to
just over $30,000, a decent price for a small luxury car that
competes nicely against similar products from Audi, Saab and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Volvo slips from their lofty ranks is in handling and
road manners, not quite managing the crisp, taut immediacy of the
Germans or the calm competence of Saab. Although the Volvo's
cornering is balanced, it is accompanied by significant body roll
and, if the pavement turns uneven, some unwanted bobbing and
weaving.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall ride is befitting a midlevel craft that melds
luxury with performance, maybe a bit firm for some, quiet on the
highway, unflustered and able to turn a back road into an enjoyable
romp. Definitely improved over the chunky ride of the 240.
</P>
<P>
   Power is provided by a small four-cylinder engine lightly
boosted with a turbocharger, providing decent performance though
accompanied by some turbo lag at low speeds. The test car was
equipped with the Mitsubishi automatic, which did a fine job of
keeping on top of the torque curve. Stick shift also is available.
</P>
<P>
   There is some four-cylinder vibration at idle, but acceleration
is smooth and quiet. Overall, the V40's handling, ride, power
delivery and refinement are light years ahead of the 240.
</P>
<P>
   But the V40 is smaller than the 240 wagon, and that is readily
apparent in the cabin space. Headroom and legroom are good up
front, though the V40 is narrow, more like a compact than a midsize
car. Rear-seat legroom is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Even more apparent is the space behind the back seat, where the
240 wagon has a broad, deep box that can accommodate a truckload of
stuff. The V40 has noticeably less cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is exceptionally well-finished with the kind of
solid bits and pieces that we've come to expect from Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   The main gripe about the interior is the same gripe I've had
about most recent Volvos: the buttons and controls seem haphazardly
arranged. Everything works fine, but it's hard to develop a feel
for where things are located.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought the stereo was subpar, despite being upgraded with
premium speakers. Some of the other options on the test car include
a sunroof and leather package that included genuine artificial wood
trim for $2,300. The sunroof is big and well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a weather package that included electronic stability
control, headlight washers and heated seats for $850; a sport
package, including fog lights, sport steering wheel, power driver
seat, CD player, trip computer and those premium speakers, for
$1,900; metallic paint for $400; and roof rails for $310.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those expensive add-ons, the V40 is a well-priced
wagon. Though the Mitsubishi influence is a sticking point for
some, as well as the car being built in Holland rather than Sweden,
I don't see any problem.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo quality shines through in every aspect of this attractive,
sporty wagon, which seems to be carving out its own place in the
market. And like that old 240, Volvo's vaunted emphasis on safety
and crash worthiness is still a strong selling point. &QL;

`DANGER RUN': AN ABSTRACT PROTEST FROM THE OLD SCHOOL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ The choreographer Donald McKayle is of the old school,
which happens to be a valid school. Mainstream modern dance's idea
that movement should go beyond design to express emotions and an
inner reality is still visible in ``Danger Run,'' his latest work
for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at its premiere on Wednesday night at City Center, ``Danger
Run'' had a strong contemporary sensibility. If not cutting edge,
it is the most abstract of McKayle's social-protest works since the
1950s. There is a complex piano score by the American composer
Frederic Rzweski, called ``Four North American Ballads,'' and the
choreography, although sometimes diffuse, stays resolutely away
from the literal.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligently and cleverly, ``Danger Run'' emerges as a protest
work that also comments on protest art of the past. Kenneth John
Verdugo has designed a wonderful backcloth-scroll evoking a WPA
mural.
</P>
<P>
   As the scroll, spread across the rear of the stage, moves
upward, the journey from African village to American South and
northern metropolis is revealed in new images that correspond to
phases in the choreography's structure. The African diaspora,
slavery, the civil rights struggle and more come alive in this
assemblage of painted villages, skyscrapers, leg irons, cotton
bales and pickets.
</P>
<P>
   Old union songs and spirituals are likewise embedded in the
richly layered score, played by a brilliant pianist in the pit,
Alan Terricciano.
</P>
<P>
   Rzweski's treatment of folk material, jumbled from the start
with assorted levels of bangs and dissonance, is never without
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A protest piece that is also a gloss on a protest piece does not
suggest the struggle (for equality, in this case) is over. It
suggests only that new ways of expression must be found.
 &UR;  &LR; Whether McKayle has totally succeeded is debatable. His vocabulary
loses a sharp definition as the piece progresses and its repetition
makes for a certain sameness in the ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Danger Run,'' enhanced by the lighting of William
H. Grant III, has the quality of a tone poem. McKayle's titles for
each section elaborate on the musical subtitles. Rzweski's
``Dreadful Memories'' becomes ``Many Thousand Gone'' and ``Which
Side Are You On?'' is called ``Run Brother Run'' in the second
section.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Renee Robinson, costumed in a silver bodice on a
brown leotard with a white ruffled skirt by the Nigerian-born
designer Omatayo Wunmi Olaiya, seems to be a Mother Africa spirit.
She weeps and guides. Bahiyah Sayyed, Mucuy Bolles, Linda Caceres,
Briana Reed, Dwana Adiaha Smallwood and Venus Hall pick up her
movement motifs: fluttering hands and crossed wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Their images of captivity are echoed by the men's ensemble,
which enters with a stamping warrior dance. Uri Sands leads Matthew
Rushing, Benoit-Swan Pouffer, Vernard J. Gilmore, Jeffrey Gerodias,
Kevin E. Boseman, Clifton Brown and Guillermo Asca in a dance that
draws partly on Martha Graham's technique. Hence, the love affair
with the ground. For all the leaps and turns, the choreography is
not aerial but weighted, with dancers often dropping to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   McKayle does not draw from African movement but speaks of Africa
in his own idiom. The third section, ``Some Through the Water,''
set to ``Down by the Riverside,'' follows the men's rage with a
duet for two of the company's finest dancers, Ms. Robinson and
Sands. The ruling image, ornamented by lifts, is of the man
enclosing the woman, even by wrapping his leg around her.
</P>
<P>
   The music in the last section, ``Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues,''
buries its melody in machinelike repetition and is retitled ``They
Keep Coming.'' Sands and Ms. Robinson lead the ensemble, whose
movements are choppier than before and accelerated. Hands are
splayed, and exciting leaps by the men lead up to an enigmatic
image that echoes one from the central duet. Ms. Robinson holds
Sands' foot in her palm.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its weak spots, ``Danger Run'' has a humanity that the
program's opening work lacks. ``Lettres d'Amour,'' by the
French-born choreographer Redha, looks as insufferable as it did
last year. Hell is dancers in an S-and-M battle of the sexes here.
The dancers yank and grovel admirably and the men wear one kneepad
in the interests of self-preservation.

   CHINA-YELTSIN (Beijing) _ President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who
is visiting China, responded sharply Thursday to President
Clinton's criticism of Russia's military assault on Chechnya,
reminding the United States that the Kremlin still has nuclear
weapons and warning that Clinton cannot ``dictate how the world
should live, work and play.'' By Erik Eckholm.

<P>
   MIDEAST-ASSESS (Jerusalem) _ A feeling that change was imminent
swept through Israel Thursday after President Clinton's surprise
announcement on Wednesday that Israeli-Syrian talks would be
resumed after nearly four years. Almost palpably, the national
pulse seemed to quicken _ for some with elation, for others with
anxiety. Even the Israeli right-wing, so uninspired these last few
months, girded up for a real opportunity. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-WORKERS (Milwaukee) _ Lots of people consider themselves
experts on this city's war on welfare, but few have ridden its
highs and lows as intensely as Michael Steinborn. Eighteen months
ago, Steinborn was an unemployed jack of the building trades, down
on his luck and in need of a job. Improbably enough, he is now one
of the system's most popular caseworkers _ and a de facto authority
on the nation's most famous welfare experiment. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   KING-TRIAL-ASSESS (Atlanta) _ With key players long dead, with
confessions recanted and altered, and with a vast conspiracy
alleged but not proven, Wednesday's verdict in the civil trial
connected to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. may
ultimately do little to demystify the tangle of fact and theory
surrounding one of the century's most traumatic events. By Kevin

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you remember what a two-liter bottle of Coke cost five or 10
years ago? Have prices gone up?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to those questions go a long way toward explaining
why M. Douglas Ivester is leaving his job after little more than
two years as Coca-Cola's &UR;  &LR; chief executive. It's hard to sustain the
stock price of a growth company when the company can't raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that in the last decade the price of soft
drinks has risen at a rate of less than 0.9 percent a year. You're
paying less now than you paid back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to the wizardry of Coke's management _ not least
the financial management that Ivester personified _ that Coke has
been viewed as a growth company. It persuaded investors to focus on
volume growth, and it emphasized international expansion. But at
bottom it was in an industry with no pricing power.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how Coca-Cola makes its money. It sells concentrate to
bottlers, which add other ingredients, and then package and sell it
to stores and restaurants. Every year, Coke raises the price of
concentrate, usually about 3 percent. But the bottlers have not
been able to pass the costs on to consumers, so their profit
margins have been squeezed. They tried to cut costs and become more
efficient, but there are limits to that, and by the time Ivester
became chief executive in 1997, the limits were being reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester tried a strategy of raising the concentrate price and
then funneling more and more money back to the bottlers that needed
it _ as marketing support. That helped the bottlers to report
better earnings, and Coke found a way to minimize the immediate
impact of those payments on its own profits.
</P>
<P>
   The move bought time, but by this year something more was
needed. The bottlers tried to charge more to consumers, only to see
sales fall. Then Coke, trying to bolster its own profits, raised
the concentrate price by far more than it normally does. The
bottlers were not happy.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, the longtime Coke watcher who now is at Merrill
Lynch, says he suspects that bottler anger may have prompted
Ivester's sudden decision to retire at the age of 52. But since
neither Ivester nor members of Coke's board are talking, there is
no way to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Coke's lagging stock price played a role. It is down 30
percent from the high it reached in the summer of 1998 and 7
percent since the end of last year. Not since 1979 has Coke's share
price had a down year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the inability to raise prices was not the only
problem Ivester confronted. Asian sales suffered when that region's
economies imploded. A strategy of growth through acquisitions ran
afoul of European antitrust regulators. The brand's image was
harmed by recalls in Europe. Perhaps a different boss would have
done better, particularly in assuaging Europeans' anger.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's still has a great brand names, but its product has
commoditylike characteristics that keep the company from raising
prices too far above those of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas N. Daft, Ivester's successor, thinks that can change.
``We believe people will pay more for more,'' he said in a
telephone interview Thursday. ``We build a complex imagery around
our product.''
</P>
<P>
   That image used to drive up the price of Coke stock. But it
hasn't worked as well in persuading consumers to pay more for
Cokes. Changing that reality is Daft's greatest challenge.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Use names for tracking AIDS virus, CDC urges
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Using names _ not numbers or other identifying codes _
at the time people are diagnosed with the AIDS virus is the best
way for states to track the epidemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention here says.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC made the recommendation for HIV tracking Thursday in its
weekly report. But it gave states a loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is one of 11 states that have no HIV tracking system. To
date, 34 states have developed an HIV surveillance system, while
four others use some combination of numbers, such as Social
Security numbers and birth dates, as identifiers. Washington state
uses a combination of names and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recommendation allows for states to use ``unique
identifiers'' instead of names as long as the system meets all its
accuracy and security parameters. It also calls for states to
continue anonymous HIV testing for people who refuse to be part of
the tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials have held hearings over the past year to
receive comments on which system to use, and the Georgia Task Force
on AIDS has recommended that some type of codes, not names, be used
when submitting HIV data to the Division of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Thursday that they are still researching
the best system to use and that ``security is of paramount
importance.'' It's still too early to say when a decision will be
reached on which system Georgia will implement, said Dr. John
Beltrami, director of AIDS surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   States now track people with AIDS, recording how many are living
with full-blown cases of the disease and how many deaths are
attributed to it. But the federal government needs a better system
of tracking people at the time they are diagnosed with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, because better drugs are forestalling the
time when the infection produces the disease.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 297,000 people in the United States have AIDS, and
300,000 to 600,000 are estimated to be HIV-infected, the CDC says.
Since 1981, 21,364 AIDS cases have been reported in Georgia, and
about half of those patients have died.
</P>
<P>
   A national HIV surveillance system will provide a better
understanding of the prevalence of the virus and much-needed data
for public health officials, such as which populations are most at
risk, where they live, at what age people are being infected and
the time elapsed before the disease progresses.
</P>
<P>
   While most agree about the need to track HIV cases, controversy
has swirled around the best way to do so. Many AIDS activists fear
that a name system will lead to breaches of confidentiality and
deter people from getting tested.

SWISS VIDEO LINKUP MARKS NEW ERA FOR IOC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Mitt Romney's favorite cartoon is the one from
the Deseret News that shows him on a billboard hyping
`MittFrugal's', his discount Winter Olympics outlet. ``We're
cheap,'' Romney is proclaiming.
</P>
<P>
   How cheap? The Salt Lake Organizing Committee board members now
pay for their own coffee and doughnuts at meetings. Brochures and
newsletters are printed in two colors, not four.
</P>
<P>
   And when Romney, president of the SLOC, makes his required
status report to the International Olympic Committee's executive
board in Switzerland Friday, he'll do it by video teleconference
instead of in person. ``We'll save $10,000,'' Romney said. ``But as
important is the time savings _ three days going over and back.
Time is of the essence now.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the scandal that gave Salt Lake City a black eye
and turned the Olympic movement inside out, organizers are
scrambling to make up time and money.
</P>
<P>
   With the 19th Winter Games less than two years away, the SLOC
still has a $148 million budget gap to close, sponsors to sign,
sports venues to complete and test, and volunteers to find and
train _ not to mention millions of still-skeptical Utahns to win
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still an ingrained concern that the Games are very
expensive, and we have a big hole to climb out of,'' conceded
Romney. ``Utah isn't the show-me state, but it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   So Romney, the Boston venture capitalist who was hailed as a
white knight when he arrived here in February, has spent much of
his time selling the Olympics at town meetings, schools, and on a
monthly radio show.
</P>
<P>
   His frankness, energy and optimism are paying off. Recent polls
in the Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News, the city's two daily
newspapers, found that more than 80 percent of Utahns were
confident that the SLOC would pull off a successful Olympics. But
most of them still expect that the Games will lose money and that
they will get stuck with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   `` `How do you feel about the Games?' is a complicated question
in Utah,'' said Romney, who graduated from nearby Brigham Young
University and whose parents were born here. ``Are you asking: `How
do I feel about how we got the Games and how they were managed
before?' Or are you asking: `How do I feel about them now and
whether they'll be a success?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The joy and pride Utahns felt when Salt Lake City finally won
the Games after five failed attempts turned to anger and shame in
November 1998 when a local TV station revealed that the bid
committee had paid to send the daughter of the IOC member from
Cameroon to college in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The bidders had done considerably more than that. Over seven
years they had secretly spent more than $1 million in payoffs,
scholarships, medical care, lavish vacations, shopping sprees and
an endless cornucopia of gifts ranging from ski parkas to crystal
globes.
</P>
<P>
   When longtime IOC member Marc Hodler of Switzerland said that
bribery and vote-peddling were standard practice in selecting host
cities, it touched off the worst scandal in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC expelled six members, pushed four more to resign and
issued warnings to 10 others. This weekend in Lausanne, the ``Lords
of the Rings'' are expected to reform everything from how they
choose members to how they choose Olympic cities.
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee, which was supposed to oversee the Salt
Lake City bid, was chastised for its laxity by a special
investigative committee headed by former US Sen. George Mitchell
and is undergoing a dramatic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the scandal, SLOC president Frank Joklik and
others stepped down. And when Romney arrived, two days after the
whole mess was detailed in a 300-page ethics report, he was greeted
as a savior and given a standing ovation by the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Romney had been told that the situation was a nightmare (``Are
you sure you want this?'' Joklik asked him). It was, he soon found,
even worse. ``When I came in, my guess was that it was an 80
percent public relations problem and a 20 percent fundamental
management problem,'' he said. ``Three weeks later, I realized it
was 20 percent public relations and 80 percent management.''
</P>
<P>
   What he had here, Romney concluded, was the kind of troubled
company he and his colleagues at Bain used to take over and turn
around. ``There are a few basic rules in a turnaround,'' he said.
``Find out how bad things are. Admit it to yourself and everybody
else. Fix the team. And focus, focus, focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the scandal, the SLOC would have been foundering.
Its revenue projections, which counted on nearly twice as much
sponsorship money ($800 million) than Atlanta had gotten for the
1996 Summer Games, were cockeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six months they had only signed one sponsor for $13 million
and every company from Atlanta but one was already in the bag,''
Romney said. ``They gave me a list of 12 they were `close' to
signing. We still haven't signed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser Bullock, the former Bain colleague whom Romney brought in
as chief operating and financial officer, went through the budget
line by line. ``And there were hundreds of thousands of lines,''
Bullock said. When he punched in the bottom line, he found a gap of
nearly $400 million on a $1.5 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't make the public feel good, but they appreciated
the honesty,'' Romney said. ``They said, at least we're being told
the truth. When things aren't going well, people fear what they
don't know more than the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney put on his marketing hat soon after he arrived, visiting
every potential sponsor and hiring five full-time salespeople
(OPUS, the joint USOC/SLOC marketing entity, has signed on IMG to
drum up even more sponsors). Ten new firms are now on board for
$100 million and the SLOC says more are in the queue.
</P>
<P>
   Then Romney and Bullock sliced more than $200 million from the
expense side. Since they've never been to an Olympics, they had the
luxury of asking naive questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been stupid like foxes,'' said Romney. ``A lot of things
didn't make sense to us. When we inquired, we found they didn't
make sense at all. Like the IOC says we're supposed to put out a
daily newspaper during the Olympics. We said, we have two
newspapers here in town. Can't we use them?''
</P>
<P>
   Then isn't now, the SLOC people say. The scandal has changed the
Olympics forever. The way it was is not how it will _ or should _
be. ``We say, tradition isn't necessarily necessity,'' Bullock
said. ``We have three categories in our budget now: must-haves,
nice-to-haves and not-needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The must-haves are written in indelible ink. The nice-to-haves
will happen only if the SLOC can find more revenue. The not-neededs
have already been disregarded. Many of the changes, like the board
members paying for their breakfasts, are symbolic. ``But it
communicates to people, `Hey, we're serious about this,' '' said
Romney. ``Small things multiplied by large numbers become large
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers no longer take an entourage to IOC meetings.
Romney and Bullock go by themselves and return the next day. And
when the ``Lords of the Rings'' come for the Games, they'll be
treated like VIPs, not royalty. ``No limos,'' said Bullock. ``It'll
be Blazers and Tahoes and Suburbans.''
</P>
<P>
   The members will stay in the original Little America hotel
downtown, not the $500-a-night ``Grand'' version going up next
door. The IOC president will have a suite, but it won't be lavish.
``It'll be what you'd find at a Marriott or a Hyatt,'' Romney said.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be no lavish reception before the IOC session just
prior to the Games. No floral bouquets. No 24-hour secretary for
each IOC member. And no blocks of prime seats sitting empty just in
case a member decides to show up unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, eager to change its image as a club of high-livin'
freeloaders, isn't arguing. ``Mr. Samaranch has been extremely open
to any suggestion we have made,'' said Romney. ``He said, anything
you need to cut that doesn't hurt the Games, go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has enabled, if not forced, everyone involved to get
back to basics. ``It's made us stop and rethink,'' admitted Romney.
``What is essential for the Games? What are the Games really
about?''
</P>
<P>
   The Games will be great for the athletes and spectators, Romney
promises, and they will break even. The Utah taxpayers will get
back the $59 million they spent on venues and the state will get
the $40 million sports endowment it's been promised. If they don't,
Romney won't take the $285,000 annual salary he's already
deferring.
</P>
<P>
   There's no free lunch _ or breakfast _ at MittFrugal's. No
embarrassing headlines, either. ``We're making progress,'' Romney
said. ``We're getting more boring. The problem with the Olympics
over the past year is that it was more about bureaucrats than
athletes. If we do our jobs right, we're invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(sidebar) &QL; 
VISITS TO BID CITIES STILL AN ISSUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While International Olympic Committee members are expected to
approve nearly all of the 50 proposed reforms when they meet at
their Swiss headquarters, they're divided on the one issue that
created the scandal in the first place _ visits to Olympic bid
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Though IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch wants to ban all
trips except for a small site evaluation group, some members insist
that they can't make an informed vote without them. ``If there are
visits in the future,'' said vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, ``my guess is that they'll be extremely tightly
controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, the IOC could organize trips at its own
expense. ``It's what Henry Kissinger calls the `big bus
alternative','' said US Olympic Committee president William Hybl,
who served with Kissinger on the IOC 2000 reform commission. ``Put
'em all on a bus and take them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everything else in the reform package _ from age
limits to term limits to a nominating and screening process for new
members _ should pass. That would allow Samaranch, who will step
down when his term ends in 2001, to claim that the embattled IOC
has remade itself when he testifies Wednesday before a
Congressional subcommittee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot more movement than anyone expected a year
ago,'' concedes John Hancock president David D'Alessandro, the
IOC's most outspoken critic. ``I think Samaranch has gotten the
most he's ever going to get out of these characters.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said it's too soon, though, to decide whether
Hancock will return as a top Olympic sponsor for the next
quadrennium. ``We will probably await the new leadership,'' he
said. ``The key is, can the new leader use these reforms to really
implement change?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies. (STAR) denotes a highly recommended film
or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa
Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro
Almodovar (R, 101 minutes). A whole new order of Almodovar
extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of this
filmmaker's earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated
style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly
dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves
its own soap opera around ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of
splendidly resilient women; the filmmaker has aptly described his
material as ``screwball drama.'' Rich and entertaining, this story
celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend
ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub
performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's
biggest treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette
Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan
Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly
finesse, Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who
flips his lid for a teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back
on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director
Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this
barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert
timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife.
Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the
film coalesces for a devastating finale. (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ANYWHERE BUT HERE,'' starring Susan Sarandon and
Natalie Portman. Directed by Wayne Wang (PG-13, 113 minutes). In a
knowing film adaptation of Mona Simpson's widely praised, if not
often wildly eventful, first novel, Ms. Sarandon is show-stopping
as the 14-year-old heroine's mother and main nemesis. And Ms.
Portman, who proves her mettle in a fully formed dramatic role,
does a terrific job of holding her own in the film's battle of
wills. Even when the material meanders, Wang supplies insightful,
affectionate direction, just as he did for ``The Joy Luck Club.'' A
picture made with feeling and acted with great flair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,'' starring John Cusack, Catherine
Keener, Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by
Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes).
Welcome to the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first
feature by a stellar video director, the reigning fears and
obsessions of a technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an
even wilder workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.'' Cusack
plays a discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into
Malkovich's mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go
downhill after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness
goes on and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This
stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of
Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to
create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately
wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into
Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it
hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing
acting needed to make it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``DOGMA,'' starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda
Fiorentino and Chris Rock. Directed by Kevin Smith (R, 130
minutes). Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two
cool dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman
Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all
existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout
comedy is any less outrageous than that. Smith again shows off a
rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious
debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms.
Fiorentino's performance, Rock's and semi-repartee from Jay and
Silent Bob) work better than others (an excrement monster). Making
a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Smith miraculously emerges with
his humor intact and his wings unsinged (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE END OF THE AFFAIR,'' starring Ralph Fiennes,
Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan
(R, 105 minutes). Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's
1951 novel, in which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble
than either lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic
filmmaker, this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a
secret twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story
with a dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the
film's underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the
setting is London in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by
the inspired costume designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in
Love'') (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``END OF DAYS,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney,
Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118
minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who
may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years.
And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty
would-be thriller. The material is so derivative that it amounts to
a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic films, with
special credit owed to ``The Exorcist'' for grisly sacrilegious
tricks. Hyams favors a jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock
value. The star dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic
forces. But Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and
has the better role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``FELICIA'S JOURNEY,'' starring Elaine Cassidy and Bob
Hoskins. Directed by Atom Egoyan (PG-13, 116 minutes). In the
brilliantly realized surreal thriller, adapted from William
Trevor's popular novel, Felicia (Ms. Cassidy), a pregnant Irish
girl searching for her boyfriend in the English midlands, is
befriended by Joseph Hilditch ( Hoskins), a catering manager who
also happens to be a serial killer. Egoyan, Canada's most gifted
filmmaker, elevates this cat-and-mouse game into a film that
transcends genre by entering the characters' consciousness and
implying a world of half-discernible connections in which the
weather, the landscape and the chance encounters of strangers
suggest the sense of a grand design (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``FLAWLESS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour
Hoffman. Written and directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 110 minutes).
De Niro is a retired New York City policeman recovering from a
stroke and Hoffman the drag queen upstairs who gives him speech
therapy in the form of singing lessons in this stridently campy
comedy. Their flashy performances can't add dimension to a movie
that is a message-laden duet for two caricatures, a homophobe and
the angry, self-loathing drag queen who gets him out of his
depression (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE INSIDER,'' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and
Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes).
Mann directs this taut thriller about the tobacco industry
whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he
illustrates why, in the corporate climate of the '90s,
truth-telling is a riskier business than it was circa ``All the
President's Men.'' While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage
as a producer for ``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike
Wallace, Crowe movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's
situation. Shaky docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60
Minutes.'' But this is an inordinately well-played thriller, with
Mann's stylistic brio at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LIBERTY HEIGHTS,'' starring Adrien Brody, Joe Mantegna
and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134
minutes). This semi-autobiographical comedy-drama remembering
teen-age life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950s Baltimore is
the fourth movie by Levinson to be set in his native city. A deeply
felt nostalgia trip, the movie adroitly captures the look and
social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the screenplay and
performances are too muted for the movie to come to terms with
growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``MANSFIELD PARK,'' starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny
Lee Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105
minutes). In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane
Austen's third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor)
has been sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over
the materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives
through a combination of wit, beauty and daring. Without bearing
down too heavily, the screenplay (which incorporates fragments of
Austen's letters and diaries) equates early 19th-century slave
trading with the oppression of women. The message is leavened with
smart humor and warm three-dimensional performances (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``SLEEPY HOLLOW,'' starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci,
Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough
and Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed
by Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy,
artfully concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter,
has little to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to
do with Burton's macabre vision. Depp makes a dashing hero as the
film's shy detective, but the story (by the writer of ``Seven'' and
``Fight Club'') is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A
first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are
attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic
beheadings. It's possible to admire Burton immensely, for the
secret tenderness and rich imagination of his work, without wanting
to peer at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SWEET AND LOWDOWN,'' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and
Uma Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage
to the kind of jaunty 1930s jazz that has been heard on many of his
other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a consummate jazz
character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn), who can play the
guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain
interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing
attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into
another cad-genius of Allen's and gives him a long-suffering mute
laundress as a sweetheart (Ms. Morton works miracles in her
wordless role). But on the storytelling level, the film remains
flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly
presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TOY STORY 2,'' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim
Allen. Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G,
98 minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first
film's wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to
computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that
Hollywood can still make movies to please audiences of any age or
persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars''
parody) to its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with
more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy
bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance
the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy
dealer, experiences newfound celebrity and needs to be rescued by
his old friends (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TUMBLEWEEDS,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J.
Brown. Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes). An
astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer
makes this small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana
a must-see film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy,
free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels
across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown).
Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving
(though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child
without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker
boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of her romantic
disasters (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is
much admired for his ``Up'' series chronicling the lives of former
schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James
Bond grow up a little, too. Brosnan has grown much more comfortable
with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters are also
more interesting than might have been expected. Ms. Marceau slinks
memorably through the role of a treacherous oil heiress. Ms.
Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school vixens than she
does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary roams from
Scotland to Central Asia. And Apted handles the action as well as
he does the talk (Maslin).

BRIDGING THE `DIGITAL DIVIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, executives of technology
companies and representatives of minorities and civil rights groups
announced a series of partnerships and initiatives Thursday to help
bridge the ``digital divide'' between technology haves and
have-nots, so that access to computers and the Internet would
become as common as that for the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The programs and commitments were announced as Commerce
Secretary William Daley opened his department's first meeting to
address the problem of the widening gap in computer access. About
800 people attended the conference, which was intended to push
government agencies and private companies to do more to narrow the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the meeting, Clinton said he had directed
Cabinet members to take specific actions, like expanding community
technology centers in low-income neighborhoods and helping
low-income workers gain the skills they needed to compete for
higher paying jobs in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we should set a national goal of making
computers and Internet access available for every American,'' the
president said in a memorandum to cabinet members. He directed
Daley to devise a national strategy to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would use his next ``new markets'' tour of
disadvantaged communities in the spring to highlight the problem
and would then issue several directives intended to increase
government efforts in this area.
</P>
<P>
   During the discussion Thursday, participants noted that efforts
needed to focus beyond getting homes and schools connected to the
Web. Internet content, they said, needed to be developed to serve
the needs and interests of minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting was planned after the Commerce Department in
July released its second report on the issue, which showed a
growing disparity between those who have access to the Internet and
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that 47 percent of whites own computers,
compared with 19 percent of blacks. It also said that a child in a
low-income white family was three times as likely to have Internet
access as a child in a comparable black family and four times as
likely as a Hispanic child.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said after the conference that he would work with Congress
to develop programs to address the problem, which could include
increased federal money for specific projects or special incentives
to encourage more private sector involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also allowed companies to showcase programs and
partnerships they were already planning.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&AMP;T, said his company would
donate $1 million to help train workers in technology. AT&AMP;T has
already given $1.4 million to community technology centers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it would provide online assistance to the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. The partnership would
provide technical assistance and training seminars and would
establish a group of ``circuit riders,'' teachers committed to
promoting Internet use among their students.

WITHOUT BARKLEY, OLAJUWON, ROCKETS LESS OF A CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics will be guarding against a letdown when
they face the Charles Barkley- and Hakeem Olajuwon-less Houston
Rockets Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed,'' coach Rick Pitino said Thursday of the
absence of Barkley, whose career ended early when he ruptured a
knee tendon Wednesday night. ``We all wanted to say goodbye to
Charles in the proper way. He has been a great ambassador for the
NBA and we are going to miss his glib way of talking. I think we
would all like to be Charles for a day and be able to say whatever
we feel like saying, without any repercussions, except maybe a fine
from the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard he might go into politics. I'm sure he will stay
around basketball but he is not going to be a coach. He is the
opposite of a coach. We have to say a lot of things that are
politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino is wary of the Rockets. And he is keeping the
Celtics' position in perspective after a 115-90 victory over Denver
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Philadelphia without Iverson,'' Pitino said. ``When
a team loses its bespyer they can be like a wounded tiger and we
are aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are good enough to beat Miami but not strong enough to beat
the Bulls, who only have one victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has used the Celtics' failures to impart lessons and
provide motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime against the Nuggets we used the Milwaukee game as
an example of how a team can come back,'' Pitino said. ``We wanted
to make sure that didn't happen, because the Nuggets are a great
comeback team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics lost a close one at Philadelphia Saturday night but
have won two of their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still a great team without Barkley,'' center Tony
Battie said of the Rockets. ``You have to prepare for them like
they have Charles. If not, you open yourself up to some surprises.
They will pick it up in his absence. It's the NBA and everyone can
play. Steve Francis is capable of a 35-point game and they are
stacked down low.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie has 40 points, 39 rebounds and 8 blocked shots in the
last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for consistency from Tony and it's been there
the last three games,'' Pitino said. ``But sometimes he gets into
foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie, 23, has brought aggressiveness and dynamism to the
center position as a complement for starter Vitaly Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   I expect to play as hard as I can, bring to the team what I can
bring and help get a win,'' Battie said. ``Lately, I've been doing
some good things. I've been having some good practices and the team
has been having good practices and we've been able to take that
into games.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie leads the team with 60 personal fouls, and he committed
five fouls without blocking a shot or making a steal against
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to pick and choose when to be aggressive,'' Battie
said. ``Sometimes if the team is scoring I want to hawk the ball a
little bit, get some deflections and sometimes that can be costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have six fouls to play with and that should be more
than enough. If I don't have three before halftime I'm fine.''

HUGE COMPANIES COLLABORATE WITH U.N. TO GAIN GLOBAL MARKETING EDGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   When Amoco started drilling for oil in Angola a few years ago,
Exxon and Chevron had already landed some of the richest oil fields
and could easily outbid their smaller rival for others. Lately,
though, Amoco has been the successful bidder on several oil tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The company, which is now BP Amoco, realized that the
Angolan government, torn by civil war, was ready to favor any
company that was also willing to assist with social projects. So in
1997 Amoco offered to spend $800,000 to help local fishermen revive
an abandoned fishing port _ and asked the local office of the U.N.
Development Program to manage the project.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Amoco and the development program have
helped repair or replace about a dozen boats, equipped them with a
variety of gear, and recruited a local bank to set up a loan
program for the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anything about fishing, or managing social
projects,'' said Finda Koroma, then Amoco's director for commercial
development and now a consultant in Houston. ``Companies don't
always understand what the U.N.'s development arms can do for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   They are understanding it more and more. Across the world, huge
companies that once shrugged off the United Nations as a worthy, if
often ineffectually bureaucratic, do-good agency are now viewing it
as a valuable partner. And the United Nations, for a change, is not
only welcoming their help but seeking it out.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations agencies rarely troll for money alone. ``We are
not interested in donations, but in relationships that let us tap
into their expertise,'' said John G. Ruggie, assistant secretary
general for strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, companies know that if they help the United
Nations with its pet projects, it will open doors and act as a
valuable buffer between them and the governments of countries in
which they wish to operate. For computer and health care companies,
which along with the oil companies are leading the new trend toward
collaboration, it is also a chance to introduce their brands to
growing markets, while playing up to agencies that routinely buy
their products.
</P>
<P>
   All this a huge change for the United Nations, which a few years
ago was so terrified of losing its patina of impartiality that it
turned down an offer from Coca-Cola to help would-be entrepreneurs
in poor countries sell beverages at sporting events, lest it seem
to be favoring Coke over Pepsi. The United Nations still carefully
guards its neutral image; it does not promote specific companies.
But now it does not turn its back, either. Instead, it solicits
help from all of an industry's players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can set up a nonexclusive arrangement with a company to
co-finance a project, why not?'' said Mark Malloch Brown, a former
World Bank vice president who has run the development program since
July. ``It's not like we're saying Microsoft gets Botswana, Corel
gets Ghana; we're stimulating competition.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to link the new corporate camaraderie to the
United Nations' much-publicized financing crunch, but it would
probably have come about anyway. What had been a trickle of
private-sector investment in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin
America and other developing economies has become a flood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, private sources invested just $43.6 billion in the
developing world. In 1997, some $252 billion of private-sector
money flowed into developing countries, compared with $77 billion
from the World Bank and other public sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N.'s member countries hadn't gotten past their
distaste for foreign investment, we could never have done our own
outreach,'' said Henry Jackelen, director of the development
program's private-sector operation. ``They realize that the
companies are sources of expertise and resources they can't get
elsewhere.''

LLOYD RODWIN, AT 80; PIONEER IN URBAN STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lloyd Rodwin, a pioneer in the multidisciplinary
approach to the field of urban studies, died of congestive heart
failure Tuesday in Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rodwin was a retired professor of urban studies at the
Massachusetts Institute Technology and co-founder of the
MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies. He was renowned for his
analyses of urban and regional problems in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   He oversaw the organization of one of the most extensive efforts
to design a new city _ Ciudad Guayana _ at the confluence of the
Orinoco and Careen rivers in Venezuela. To plan the city, Mr.
Rodwin led an interdisciplinary team from the MIT-Harvard Joint
Center, which he co-founded with Martin Meyerson in 1959. The
combined efforts of economists, anthropologists, sociologists, and
other social scientists, as well as land-use planners, became a
model for a new kind of integrated planning. Following his 1969
book on this project, ``Planning Urban Growth and Regional
Development,'' his colleagues published seven others that analyzed
the Ciudad Guayana project from diverse disciplinary perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, MIT professor Bernard Frieden, a student of Mr. Rodwin
and one of his successors as head of the Center for Urban Studies,
said, ``Lloyd really changed the field from city planning to urban
studies. He emphasized research on how cities work and worked with
people outside of planning like Pat Moynihan ( US Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York), James Q. Wilson, Oscar Handlin, Alan
Altshuler, and Martin Meyerson. Lloyd made the field much broader,
and extended it to the Third World.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rodwin was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. He attended City College
in New York City, where he studied with and was deeply influenced
by philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen. He then studied at New School
for Social Research before earning a master's degree in land
economics at the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in
regional planning at Harvard University in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   His view that social science should complement physical planning
helped change planning education in the United States. While
chairman of the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning from
1969-1973, he oversaw a tripling of the faculty. He transformed the
department by introducing new social science faculty and course
work as well as a focus on international comparative studies,
housing policy, environmental policy, and economic development. The
MIT program served as a model for others around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author or editor of 11 books, including a forthcoming
edited volume, with Bishwapriya Sanyal, titled ``The Profession of
City Planning: Changes, Images and Challenges, 1950-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher, he trained generations of planners around the
world. He was known for his use of Socratic questioning, a
technique he drew from his studies in philosophy and applied to the
study of complex and controversial issues in planning. In the
classroom, Mr. Rodwin would typically get students to state their
position and then argue the opposite side. When asked what they
learned years later, students often said, ``He taught us how to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Nadine Posniak Rodwin of Cambridge; two
sons, Victor G. of New York and Marc A. of Bloomington, Ind.; a
daughter, Julie A. of Groton; a brother, Ted Rosenbaum, and a
sister, Claire Levy of Laguna Hills, Calif.; and six grandchildren.

 UNDATED: get elsewhere.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate largess to the United Nations is not entirely new, of
course. Ted Turner made headlines when he donated $1 billion of
stock in 1997. And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has
earmarked $26 million to help UNICEF wipe out tetanus in infants.
</P>
<P>
   But these were philanthropic gifts spearheaded by individuals
whose money was derived from their industrial activities. The new
trend is for companies themselves to use U.N. collaboration as a
marketing tool, not just a philanthropic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we want to help eradicate neonatal tetanus, but we
also want to stimulate the use of nonreusable injection devices,
and to build relationships with ministries of health that might buy
other products from us as their economies develop,'' said Gary M.
Cohen, president of the medical systems unit of Becton Dickinson &AMP;
Co. He is working with UNICEF _ one of its biggest customers for
syringes and other medical devices _ to distribute the company's
patented disposable syringes for the same anti-tetanus program the
Gates Foundation is supporting.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the companies confining their giving to their own
products and expertise. Many, particularly oil companies, are
contributing to U. N. programs on entrepreneurship and human
rights, in hopes of promoting stability in countries with civil
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Chevron, which had been drilling oil in
Kazakhstan for five years, contributed $500,000 toward a business
center, run by the U.N. Development Program, that helps
Kazakhstanis set up new businesses. Citigroup's Citibank is in on
the project, too, helping to run an operation that gives
entrepreneurs small loans.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which operates in the same building in the city of
Atyrau as Chevron, has already yielded 19 businesses. It helped a
local doctor set up a private ambulance service, and a
businesswoman rent refrigerators to stock and sell ice cream. Now,
it is helping locals set up a bowling alley in the region, as well
as Atyrau's first supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to our desire to have a stable economic and
political environment in which to operate, and to stimulate the
local economy,'' said Philip L. Meek, president of Chevron
Munaigas, Chevron's Kazakhstan operation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, companies could donate products or services without
using the United Nations as a go-between. But in many parts of the
world, the concept of free enterprise is so new that they do not
know where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bridge to the community was essential in a country that had
no real grass-roots civil society before 1989,'' said Zoltan
Valcsicsak, who handles community affairs for Levi Strauss in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Levi Strauss recently funneled
$40,000 to the development program to help combat AIDS in Poland,
where it has a plant.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives note that U.N. officials understand the
sensitivities of governments that do not want to think of
themselves as backwards. ``The U.N. has been in Russia a lot longer
than we have,'' said John McKeegan, a spokesman for Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, which recently elicited the development program's help in
setting up an educational program for cardiologists in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Reza Ghaffari, who runs Citibank's offices in
Kazakhstan, notes that the development program encouraged local
entrepreneurs to take group loans, on the theory that peer pressure
would go far in encouraging all members to repay their shares. ``We
could have just donated the money without bothering to insist on a
sustainable initiative,'' Ghaffari said, ``but this approach will
have a greater impact on the community.''
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps the United Nations' most powerful lure of all is
that it provides an administrative backbone for projects that
companies would just as soon not undertake alone. ``Private
industry really doesn't have the expertise to run community
programs,'' said Anne Krisitin Sydnes, a vice president of Statoil,
the big Norwegian oil company, which hooked up with the development
program and Amnesty International last year for a project to train
Venezuelan judges on how to deal with human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the United Nations rarely has the expertise to pull
nascent economies into the Internet age. Take the development
program's NetAid project, which was kicked off with benefit
concerts in New Jersey, London and Geneva on Oct. 9. Unlike Farm
Aid and similar fund-raising concerts, NetAid was not a one-shot
deal; the development program persuaded numerous Internet-related
companies that it was to their benefit to help it use the concerts
to publicize www.netaid.org, a Web site the development program
hopes to parlay into a matchmaking tool for corporations and
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, a major provider of the routers, switchers and
other equipment that powers the Internet, provided much of the
marketing, as well as the technology to enable millions of people
to tap into the concerts online. Cisco, in turn, persuaded the
accounting and consulting firm KPMG, which it partly owns, to
design the Web page. And it persuaded Akamai, a year-old technology
firm, to contribute its expertise in easing Internet logjams. ``It
seemed a terrific way to showcase our technology,'' said an
executive at Akamai, which recently went public.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, high-technology involvement is not ending with NetAid.
Orientation.com, a New York-based company that runs an
advertising-supported network of Internet portals in 20 countries,
is providing material for portals that the development program
wants to run in an additional 31 countries. ``The UNDP gives us
contact with their partners in new countries, and with information
that we can use on our other portals,'' said Tamara Bekefi, a
project manager at Orientation.com.
</P>
<P>
   Corel, a software company based in Ottawa, is contributing a
suite of business-oriented software for the development program to
use in its effort to set up Internet systems in developing
countries. Corel's software runs on the Linux operating system,
which can be downloaded free from the Internet, and it figures that
if Web novices get used to Linux now, they are less likely to flock
to Windows later. Indeed, Corel has thrown Netscape Navigator, a
prime competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, into its
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is still the clear No. 1, and if we can foster brand
loyalty early on, maybe we can level the playing field,'' said
Michael Cowpland, Corel's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer companies have similar aims. Rebel.com, a
Canadian hardware company that Corel partly owns, figures that
computers operated by a free system like Linux are likely to sell
well in poorer countries. ``Our investment is not under the veil of
philanthropy,'' said Michael Mansfield, president of Rebel.com,
which is contributing about $250,000 worth of computers. ``It is
coming out of our marketing budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strategic thinking is starting to pervade some U.N.
agencies themselves. Its Population Fund, which distributes
contraceptives in developing countries, is setting up meetings
between drug executives and officials in Egypt and India, in hopes
of helping the companies overcome high tariffs and other barriers
to selling contraceptives there. And the fund expects to set up a
Web-based system eventually, one in which governments can buy
contraceptives at prices the fund has negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't even asking for product donations,'' said Corrie
Shanahan, a spokeswoman for the fund. So why bother? ``If the
companies sell contraceptives to the middle classes in those
countries, it will free up our supply for poor people.''

MURRAY B. LEVIN, 72; AUTHOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Murray Burton Levin of Newton, a retired professor of
political science at Boston University who published volumes on
America's alienated voters and the political discourse on radio
talk shows, died Wednesday in Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   In Mr. Levin's first book, ``The Alienated Voter,'' published in
1960, he explored what he called ``the widespread belief that
voters feel impotent, believe that all politicians are crooks and
assume that the outcome of elections is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   In his follow-up, ``The Compleat Politician,'' in 1962, he
studied how candidates court these alienated voters. In ``Kennedy
Campaigning'' in 1966, he examined the power of big money and the
appeal of what he called ``beautiful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Levin explored the McCarthyism of the 1950s in ``Political
Hysteria in America'' (1971) and the dynamics of talk radio and the
emergence of what he called ``peean conservatism in ``Talk Radio
and the American Dream'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Levin estimated he taught more than 18,000 students during
his 30 years at Boston University. He also taught at Stonehill
College and Harvard University Extension School and appeared many
times as a political analyst on the CBS, NBC, and PBS television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Brookline. He graduated from Harvard College and
earned a doctorate in political science at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from full-time teaching at Boston
University in 1990, he taught urban politics to high-risk
adolescents for Action for Boston Community Development.
</P>
<P>
   This led to his 1998 book,``Teach Me: Kids Will Learn When
Oppression is the Lesson'' , about what he learned teaching at the
Greater Egleston Community High School, an alternative school in
Jamaica Plain with a student body of youths who had failed to learn
at mainstream schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death he was writing a book with the working
title ``Political Consultants in the Age of Illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Helen Jacobson; three sons, Joshua C. of
Newton, Jacob P. Goldstein of Cambridge and Seth Goldstein of
Boston; and a daughter, Jessica Goldstein of Stoughton.

 &HT;    BellSouth to join Dutch bid for firm
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth today will announce a $9 billion partnership
with a Dutch phone company to bid for E-Plus, a German wireless
provider, setting the stage for the Atlanta-based company to make
still more inroads in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the move, BellSouth is demonstrating a renewed
international interest. The deal pits it against the two biggest
phone companies in Europe, both of which have been mentioned as
possible partners for BellSouth: France Telecom, which had a bid on
the table to buy E-Plus, and Deutsche Telekom, on whose turf E-Plus
competes.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth already owns 22.5 percent of E-Plus Mobilfunk,
Germany's third-largest wireless carrier, and had a right of first
refusal on the rest. The company could have forsworn that right and
forged a pact that permitted France Telecom to take control.
BellSouth also could have blocked France Telecom as part of an
embrace with its archrival Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it chose a third way, jockeying to block France Telecom
while partnering with an aggressive, but smaller player: KPN
Telecom NV. That company is, in some ways, in a similar position to
that of BellSouth: large enough to be ambitious, but perhaps not
big enough to fend off a takeover. Unlike BellSouth, KPN Telecom
has been separating itself into units that might let it find
partners who wouldn't be interested in working with the whole
company.
</P>
<P>
   The complex deal with BellSouth would make E-Plus a joint
venture between the two companies. On Thursday, BellSouth officials
did not specify how big its portion of the $9 billion partnership
would be.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of partnership with KPN Telecom opens the door to the
kind of ties that any U.S. company needs to compete in Europe _ and
vice versa. KPN has a range of businesses, including operations in
Belgium, Holland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   One ambitious option bandied about as part of the E-Plus deal
was the merger of KPN's wireless properties with E-Plus and
BellSouth's wireless unit in Denmark and perhaps its mobile data
investments in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium.
However, it appears that the companies will not go that far _ at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But just bidding for E-Plus is bold for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is a fair chunk of change. France Telecom has offered
$9 billion for the 77.5 percent of E-Plus that BellSouth does not
own. Current stake owners Vodafone AirTouch and two German
utilities are selling their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The largest deal BellSouth has made in the recent past was last
year's $3.5 billion investment in Qwest Communications. That bought
10 percent of Qwest, a stake cut in half by Qwest's merger with US
West.
</P>
<P>
   But the most money BellSouth ever dropped on the table was the
failed $100 billion bid to outgun MCI WorldCom at the 11th hour for
Sprint in October. MCI WorldCom came back with a dramatically
higher offer and BellSouth withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth was seen by some as having missed its last opportunity
to find the muscle and reach it needs to compete in what
increasingly is a global market. Analysts whispered of BellSouth's
vulnerabilities, its tacit admission that it needed to make a big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sprint bid also proved that BellSouth was willing to
move, and the purchase of E-Plus would show that BellSouth has not
been paralyzed by the failed effort to buy Sprint. It also may show
that BellSouth is not afraid of the ever more raucous competition
in a deregulated European market that seems ripe for consolidation,
acquisitions and rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it signals that BellSouth wants to be considered a
global player _ despite the vastly greater size amassed by
companies like AT&AMP;T, British Telecom, MCI WorldCom, SBC and Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth for some time boasted of its three-legged strategy,
splitting its hopes on its Southeast franchise in local service,
its wireless business and its international investments. But it has
been some time since BellSouth added to its presence in Europe, the
most lucrative market outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is the largest outside investor in Latin America but
has been marginal elsewhere. BellSouth has a wireless unit in
Israel and two operations on the Continent: Denmark, where it owns
46.5 percent of a wireless system, and Germany, the region's
largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   E-Plus has 3.1 million customers, 16 percent of the German
wireless business. The company has revenue of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's current interest is worth about $3 billion, based on
the France Telecom bid. Yet KPN Telecom has made arrangements for a
loan of about $13.3 billion, apparently preparing for still more
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, whose telecommunications sectors are currently in the
throes of deregulation, is expected to see rapid growth in
services. Moreover, the region will likely see a slew of
consolidations as national companies are privatized to face
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible partners is Qwest, which is building a
high-speed network in Europe. As part of that effort, Qwest already
has a joint venture with KPN Telecom.

RIVERS URGES BLACK LEADERS TO CONFRONT SEX ISSUE IN AIDS CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Eugene Rivers brought his Boston-based
urban ministry to the nation's capital Thursday and unspooled an
evangelical salvo against black church and political leaders, in
his effort to bring attention to the plight of AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the crisis _ which has already claimed 12 million
lives in sub-SaharaAica _ to be directly linkedto ``sexual
promiscuity,'' Rivers charged that black American leaders, in and
out of the pulpit, have been reluctant to discuss the role of
sexual behavior in the crisis because of what he called
``hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's flush it all out of the bushes, all of this nonsense
about irresponsible sexual behavior being OK,'' Rivers said in a
60-minute address at the National Press Club. He was flanked by a
dozen ministers and activists he has recruited from around the
country for his effort. ``We must get the ministers themselves
right on this issue also. They can't preach one thing on Sunday
then go out abusing women the rest of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers said he has no doubts that he can connect black America
to the AIDS crisis in Africa. ``Everybody is talking about
globalization, why shouldn't American blacks?'' he said. ``What
happens to the little black girl in Harare is the same as what
happems to the little black girl in Harlem. The little black girl
in Harare listens to hip-hop music produced in Harlem and uses it
as an introduction into a life of sexual decadence and
degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Rivers's 21st Century Group _ the intellectual
arm of his 10-point Coalition, which focuses on urban woes _ also
attended.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers released an ``open letter'' Thursday, outlining the AIDS
crisis and calling upon black American leaders to become engaged in
efforts to bring international attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers is also calling on each black American church to identify
an AIDS sufferer in either America or Africa, and support that
person ``materially or financially.'' He announced a national
summit on AID to be held in Los Angeles in early 2000 at the West
Los Angeles Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers also announced plans to apply diplomatic pressure to
retrieve some of the ``billions'' of dollars corrupt African
leaders have siphoned from their governments and have that money
deposited in a special fund for AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   At times in his address, Rivers, dressed in full ministerial
garb, thundered like a Sunday morning preacher who has been absent
from his pulpit too long. He thundered when he announced that he
has every intention to turn the African AIDS crisis into an
election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Vice President Al) Gore does th right thing, he should be
blessed,'' Rivers said. ``If he doesn't, he should be held
accountable for his sins. The same goes for (Texas Governor) George
W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ronald Clifton Potter of Jackson, Miss., was one of the
ministers who spoke with Rivers at the Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take this challenge of promiscuity seriously,'' Potter
said, ``we take the old prophecy of `can these bones be saved?' The
question comes back, `Lord, only you know.' Well, let us be part of
that answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' came the loud chorus led by Rivers.

TEXAS WINS LEGAL BATTLE OVER PRISON FOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Montreal) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state has won a legal battle that could save
taxpayers more than $30 million in a prolonged contractual fight
over an unpopular prison food.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the prison system's
massive purchase of VitaPro, a soy-based product that was dished
out as a cost-saving meat substitute from 1994-96, was illegal
because competitive bids weren't sought.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling stands, Texas won't have to pay the Canadian
company that provided the food in a controversial arrangement that
led to the indictment of the company's owner and a top prison
official.
</P>
<P>
   After inmates and guards claimed that the food _ served in main
dishes such as casseroles, enchiladas and meatless loafs _ made
them ill, prison officials stopped serving VitaPro in mid-1996 and
began feeding it to livestock.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200,000 pounds of the food pellets were delivered to
the prison system under long-term contracts that initially called
for delivery of up to 39 metric tons a month, with a projected
total cost between $33 million and $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ruling was based on a finding that the food pellets,
made from processed soybeans, dehydrated vegetables and flavoring,
were not an ``agricultural commodity'' or raw material that might
have been exempt from bidding requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase orders for VitaPro that were construed as contracts are
not binding, the state's highest civil court determined in its
unanimous opinion. It reversed a 1998 decision by a Texarkana
appellate court, which said a trial was warranted to further
scrutinize the contracts, and it upheld a 1996 ruling in the
state's favor by a Huntsville district court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed in the decision. We thought the Texarkana
court of appeals had it right when they said there were issues for
a jury to resolve,'' said VitaPro attorney P. Michael Jung of
Dallas. ``We're still evaluating our options'' regarding appeals,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 decision, state District Judge Bill McAdams decided
that the state was not obligated to pay the full amount of the
purchase orders because the official who issued them was not
authorized to do so without approval of the Texas Board of Criminal
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Although purchase orders totaled more than $33 million, only
$3.3 million was paid to the producer, VitaPro Foods Inc. of
Montreal. No refund is being sought on the amount already paid.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal investigators subsequently said the official
who ramrodded the five-year deal, former prisons director James A.
``Andy'' Collins, was on VitaPro's payroll _ before and after he
left the top job at the Institution Division of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said records indicated Collins agreed to accept
$20,000 from VitaPro a month before he resigned under fire on Dec.
31, 1995. The money was transferred to Collins after he left the
state job, when he became a $1,000-a-day consultant to VitaPro for
a short time, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Collins and VitaPro president Yank Barry were
indicted by a federal grand jury in Houston on multiple counts of
conspiracy, bribery, money laundering and other charges. Collins is
scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 25 before U.S. District Judge Lynn
N. Hughes. Barry's trial is set for February.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at Brown University said Thursday that they had found
tantalizing evidence that the northern lowlands of Mars once bore a
wide ocean that, until it dried up, had waves, hidden depths and
long beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported the Friday issue of the journal Science,
were hailed for making the best case yet for the existence of a sea
on primordial Mars. Although the findings bore no direct evidence
of alien life on the planet, the large amounts of water would
indicate that life might once have thrived on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it proved in the way we understand that dinosaurs
once walked on the Earth,'' said Victor Baker, a planetary
scientist at the University of Arizona, who has long looked for
signs of a vanished Martian sea that may have existed more than a
billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were made by a six-person team at Brown led by
James Head III, a planetary geologist. The team examined six
categories of evidence, all of which turned out to support the
ocean hypothesis. The data are from the Mars Global Surveyor, which
has been orbiting Mars for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The findings include hints of ancient shorelines and, parallel
to them, curved terraces suggesting the leveling action of waves
and other ocean processes as the Martian sea retreated. Another
clue is that the area's central basin is unusually flat and smooth,
implying these features were made of thick accumulations of bottom
muds and sediments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's compelling,'' Head said, adding that he was initially
skeptical of the sea hypothesis. ``It makes me want to look at the
issue a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of water on Mars, he added, ``is linked to questions
about the possibility of life there and changes in climate and
things on Earth,'' like long-term shifts in the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Parker, a planetary geologist at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, who was an early Mars ocean theorizer, said
the new evidence, already widely discussed among scientists, was
proving to be widely persuasive. ``There's always going to be
skeptics,'' he said. ``But most of the community is accepting this
as almost smoking-gun proof that there were oceans on Mars.
Ultimately, I think we're going to have to dig holes in the
shoreline and look for sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The new findings underscored the magnitude of the recent loss of
the $165 million Mars Polar Lander, which disappeared Dec. 3 while
attempting to land near the Martian south pole to search for water.
Editors at Science said the loss of the spacecraft had no impact on
the timing of the ancient-ocean paper. In September yet another
Mars craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, vanished as it approached the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Mars today is an icy desert with dust storms and reddish dunes.
While it also bears thin, tattered clouds, the only place the red
planet shows evidence of water in any quantity is at its north and
south poles, where there seems to be a mix of carbon dioxide and
water, like frozen seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that Mars in its early days was much warmer and
wetter and they have even found channels in the planet's surface
that once apparently carried rushing water into the northern
lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Parker in 1989 and Baker in 1991 went further. They proposed
that the flowing water collected in large standing bodies or seas.
At the time, their ideas were considered wild.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown study has given that hypothesis its most rigorous
test. The main tools of the investigation were thousands of
photographs and altitude measurements made by the Mars Global
Surveyor, a $150 million craft that went into orbit around Mars in
1997 and began its prime mission in 1998. In May, based on surveyor
data, scientists unveiled the first three-dimensional map of the
red planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown team extended the surveyor work. Among other things,
it analyzed height measurements made with great precision as a
surveyor laser bounced beams off the planet's surface, allowing
land elevations to be learned by measuring the time of the round
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Among the important findings, based on altimetry and photos
were:
</P>
<P>
   _The border between two geologically dissimilar areas in the
northern lowlands is nearly level in elevation, suggesting an
ancient coastline.
</P>
<P>
   _The topography below this possible shoreline is much smoother
than that of the region above at higher altitudes, which is
consistent with smoothing by sedimentation.
</P>
<P>
   _The volume of the possible sea is within the range of previous
estimates of water on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   _A series of terraces runs parallel to the apparent shoreline,
bolstering the idea of receding waters.
</P>
<P>
   _Low areas bear what appear to be mud cracks, like those in dry
terrestrial lake beds.
</P>
<P>
   _Scars from impact craters suggest that ground water or ice in
the northern lowlands lies close to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Head said that the possible sea would have covered about
one-sixth of Mars and ranged up to a mile deep. By terrestrial
measure, he said, it would have been bigger than the Mediterranean
Sea and Arctic Ocean combined.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Head, the authors of the Science paper are Harald
Hiesinger, Mikhail Ivanov, Mikhail Kreslavsky, Stephen Pratt and
Bradley Thomson. Ivanov and Kreslavsky also have posts at,
respectively, the Vernadsky Institute of the Russian Academy of
Sciences and the Kharkov Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, while praising the new findings, said further
evidence was needed. Michael Carr, a planetary geologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey and author of ``Water on Mars'' (Oxford,
1996), said he particularly admired the evidence of wave-pounded
terraces, which he called very convincing. But he questioned some
of the team's imagery interpretations, like their conclusions about
the depth of ground ice or water, and the proposed edges of the
putative sea.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that further searches for ocean terraces, based on
the surveyor's altimetry data, could prove conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Head suggested that further research might also include an
analysis of meteorites from Mars and samples from landing sites on
the red planet, which could be checked for the presence of salts
that might be related to an ancient ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy,'' he said, ``is that something this important
is worth a lot of my research time.''  &QL;

ISRAELIS DEBATE PROSPECT OF PEACE WITH SYRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Israelis woke up Thursday to the prospect of peace
with Syria, perhaps their most bitter enemy, and quickly began
debating the price they are willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafes and crowded streets of downtown Tel Aviv, people
read morning papers headlined with Wednesday night's announcement
that Israel and Syria would reopen talks for the first time in
three years by holding unprecedented high-level, face-to-face talks
in Washington next week aimed at clinching a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an insane risk. It's not worth it,'' said Shai Krel, 28,
who during his three years in the Israeli Defense Forces was
stationed along the border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping espresso outside the tobacco store he owns on Ibn Givrol
Street, he added, ``Peace is not in the land, it is in the mind. .
. . I've never been convinced that Syria really wants peace with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Odelia Arad, a 28-year-old law student, pulling hard on a
Marlboro Light before taking a set of final exams, was thrilled
about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be having humus in Damascus,'' she said, adding that
she trusted Barak to ensure Israel's safety in any possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel feels safe in his hands,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   How Israelis feel about Wednesday's stunning diplomatic
breakthrough is more than just an excercise in gauging public
opinion. The whole process could hinge on a unique voter referendum
in Israel which will be held in the aftermath of any agreement that
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to an agreement will not be easy. Even if all the
generals and all the heads of state work out every technical aspect
of security and demilitarization of the border. Even if Israel
gives up the strategic Golan Heights which it captured from Syria
in 1967 and held onto in bloody fighting in 1973. It will still all
come down to a vote in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected in part on the
promise that he would bring to a vote any final agreements on the
Syrian track and on the for-now bogged down Palestinian track, and
he says he is going to stick by it.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, quoted Thursday in Israel's mass-market daily Yediot
Ahronot, said a ``decisive and sweeping'' majority of Israelis
would back him up in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum would be the first of its kind in Israel's 50
years, and is an experimental form of of diplomacy by consensus
that has only rarely been tested before in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the architects of the
original peace process begun six years ago with the Palestinians
and five years ago with Syria, said at a meeting with reporters
Thursday, ``We will have to deal now very intensively with
preparations for a referendum. Without a referendum there won't be
any implementation of an agreement between Syiria and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yehuda Ben Meir, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center and an expert on public opinion and the peace
process, said the result of the referendum would depend on more
than just the final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to technical security measures, the Israeli people
will be looking for gestures from Syria that convince them there is
a genuine change. When (slain Egyptian President Anwar) Sadat came
to Ben Gurion Ariport and then the Knessett, Israelis saw that he
was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a dramatic gesture like this,'' said Ben Meir,
referring to Sadat's historic visit which paved the way for the
historic 1979 Camp David agreement between Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin said that if an agreement is reached, ``This will be the
end of slogans. We have to give up something and they have to give
up something. And that is our test. This is again subject to the
referendum, with both the Syrians and the Palestinians, we will
have to go back to the people and get them to allow us to sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Syrian President Hafez Assad has long insisted
that any agreement is impossible without Israel's return of the
Golan Heights to borders that existed before the 1967 war when
Israel seized the military high ground that looms over much of
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18,000 Israelis live in the Golan, where wineries and
cattle ranches dot the countryside. The heights are a crucial water
resource in a region where water is as precious as life. It is the
main source of the Jordan River and borders the Sea of Galilee, two
sources which provide more than one-third of Israel's drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said since he was elected five months ago that he was
willing to consider returning Golan territory, but with strict
security conditions, a dismantling of Syria's massive military
presence along the border, and control over water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Already the political lobbying for the referendum has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary hawk and opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon
scoffed at Barak's assertion that he is going into the talks
without any agreements on what it would give up to Syria, saying
the talks were a ``total surrender'' to Syrian demands.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Heitner, a spokesman for the Golan Residents Committee, said
giving back the heights would be bowing to the ``the dictates of a
Syrian tyrant'' and said the right-leaning members of Barak's
coalition government would battle him tooth and nail on any
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At the talks in Washington Assad will be represented by his
foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, and Barak will himself attend.
The meeting between a prime minister and foreign minister would
seem diplomatically awkward, but Israeli and US officials Thursday
insisted that Sharaa was handling the talks because of the
practical concerns over the health of the ailing 69-year-old Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's regime was busy doing its own shoring up of public
opinion Thursday. Syrian newspapers carried banner headlines and
large photographs of Assad and Clinton, with Barak noticeably not
featured. A commentary in the official Tishrin daily said Syria
would not give up ``one iota'' of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   How the reopening of the Syrian track of negotiations could
affect the stalled talks between Palestinians and Israelis was an
issue of concern on the streets of Palestinian areas in East
Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made public pronouncements of
his pleasure at the opening of the talks with Syria. But privately
Palestinian officials confirmed that the bad blood between Arafat
and Assad, which dates back to Lebanon's long civil war, is no
secret. And one Palestinian official said that there are private
concerns that Barak will ignore the more difficult stages of the
Palestinian talks, which are stalled on the issue of settlement
expansion, to focus on Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former military chief of staff and
current tourism minister in Barak's cabinet, has played key roles
in earlier negotiations on both the Palestinian and Syrian tracks.
He dismissed the notion that the two tracks could not progress in
unison and offered the negotiations with neighboring Jordan which
were clinched in 1996 while the Palestinian peace process also
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it then and we can do it now,'' he said.

NASA NEEDS PUBLIC'S SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX A $165 million loss is hard to swallow. But the gag
reflex over what happened to the Mars Polar Lander shouldn't choke
off funding or support for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency's gee-whiz days of taking men to the moon may
seem as far away as the Red Planet. But the potential for great
accomplishments remains, and the importance of a healthy space
exploration program is as real as the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
   NASA taught us more than the average person can comprehend about
outer space. But that knowledge did not come without failure.
Today's failure can lead to tomorrow's insights and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA can't do great things as the timid, angst-ridden
whipping boy of a disenchanted public. It needs the brash, can-do
attitude of its glorious past to overcome today's setbacks. Public
support can help it re-create that powerful Big Man on Campus
mind-set. The loss of public support can lead to NASA's complete
failure and enduring defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's room for soul-searching, and there's plenty of
reason to demand explanations. It's not just the Mars missions that
are troubled. The space shuttle Discovery's journey to rescue the
Hubble Space Telescope has been delayed as NASA ponders what to do
about a badly dented fuel line.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's ``faster, cheaper, better'' approach may need
rethinking, as Fred DeJarnette, founding director of the Mars
Mission Research Center at North Carolina State University, said.
</P>
<P>
   But the source of that strategy is likely the budget cuts that
NASA has suffered in Congress. In an opinion piece in today's
``Republic,'' physics professor and author Robert L. Park points
out that those cuts fall disproportionately on NASA's science
program because Congress is pushing the $100 billion International
Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that NASA's three Mars mission failures are due to
mismanagement or incompetence should not be dismissed. But it's
worth asking whether the mismanagement is at the agency or
congressional level.

 &HT;    Daft's priority: Long-term growth
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Douglas Daft, the new president of Coca-Cola, said
Thursday that his greatest challenge will be to leave an indelible
mark on the company like his predecessors did _ and enjoy himself
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But first, ``I have to get through the next couple of days,''
Daft joked during his first round of media interviews since
becoming president and chief operating officer earlier this week.
The promotion was prompted by Chairman M. Douglas Ivester's
decision to retire in April, when Daft will take over that job.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, 56, reassured investors that the Atlanta-based beverage
giant is committed to building shareholder value over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't concentrate on the short-term swings in the (stock)
market,'' said the former head of Coca-Cola's Middle East, Far East
and Africa operations. ``The company is committed to its long-term
growth goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have questioned those goals, saying they are
overly ambitious and cannot be sustained. The goals include annual
average increases in global case sales of 7 percent to 8 percent,
as well as earnings-per-share growth of between 15 percent and 20
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Coca-Cola has been able to meet those goals
fairly consistently, propelling huge profits for its long-term
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the company has failed to hit those targets _
depressing its stock _ largely because of troubled economies in
parts of Asia, Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those economies have improved, Daft said, they
still have not fully gotten back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, he is convinced the good ol' days for Coke
shareholders will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities haven't changed,'' he said. ``We are
perfectly positioned to benefit'' from economic rebounds around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Daft said he will follow the advice of the
company's late chairman, Roberto C. Goizueta, who stressed the
value of focusing on a ``short and critical agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be developing that agenda after discussing key issues
with other senior executives, as well as by remembering a central
lesson he learned during his three decades with the company:
``Don't lose your intuition.''
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized the importance of building relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have criticized Ivester for not doing enough of
that, saying that may have aggravated some of the company's recent
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a high value on people and relationships,'' Daft said.
``People are critical to my success. ... the consumer is king.''
</P>
<P>
   He said building stronger ties with bottlers and retailers will
be an essential part of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Daft said he doesn't plan any changes in the company's recent
decision to raise the price of concentrate it sells to bottlers to
make soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   That decision caused bottlers to raise prices, especially in
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose $1.62 1/2 Thursday, closing at $62.12
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The shares got a boost from analyst David Goldman of Banc of
America Securities, who raised his rating of the stock to ``buy''
from ``market perform.'' He predicted the shares will reach $75
within 12 months.

ARIZONA DEMOCRATS OK'D FOR INTERNET PRIMARY BALLOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arizona Democrats for the first time can cast their
ballots over the Internet during the party's presidential primary
in March.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 50,000 Democrats will be able to vote online from
their homes and offices, as long as they registered with the party
in advance and received a special digital code to verify their
identity. They will also be able to vote at ``online booths'' set
up in at least one voting centr in each community in the state,
according to Cortland Coleman, the Arizona Democratic Party's
political director.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the state party had wanted to hold its primary Feb.
22, the same day Arizona Republicans are having theirs. But when
the Democratic National Committee objected, because of an already
hectic voting calendar, the Arizona Democrats decided to keep their
primary on March 11 and drum up interest in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are holding theirs three weeks earlier, and we
wanted to get some publicity,'' Coleman said. ``We were looking at
different ways we could increase participation, increase
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Several states and counties have experimented with online
voting, and others have said they hope to open online polls in
future elections. But none has held an Internet election that
really counts. In mosces, the votes have simply been to see whether
the online systems work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns from political scientists, many companies
developing the software and technology for online elections say
they are confident of the security and accuracy. There are other
worries, too. Arizona election director Jessica Funkhouser said
``several things would have to happen'' before Internet voting
takes root beyond the state Democratic Party, including somehow
ensuring that minorities and voters in poor areas have equal access
to the polls even if they don't have computers or access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, all eyes will be on the state's
Democratic primary this spring. ``We're interested in looking at
it,'' she said. ``We'll do anything that wil help people who want
to participate.''

&HT;        OIL PRICES TOO HIGH, ENERGY SECRETARY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 - Department of Energy Sec. Bill Richardson
said oil prices are ``dangerously'' high and said he would consider
contingency options to stabilize prices if they continue to climb
in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As any secretary of energy I am prepared to recommend to the
president any steps are necessary to protect the American consumer
and the American economy,'' Richardson told reporters after
speaking at an energy security conference. ``I want to see what
happens in the next few weeks to determine what further action we
might take.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to explain what action this would be and refused to
name specific price levels that would trigger a move. But the
secretary said that $27 per barrel, the nine-year-high for crude
reached last month when Iraq cut off shipments in disagreement with
a United Nations plan -- was ``a little high.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil analysts dismissed the likelihood that the United States
would cut prices by taking oil from the country's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, a crude oil stockpile reserved only for
emergency domestic shortages. The Energy Department has opposed
tapping the 572 million barrels of oil reserves to ease prices in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for delivery in January fell 64 cents, or 2.4 percent,
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after Richardson's comments
this afternoon, Bloomberg reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although Richardson affirmed that markets should dictate energy
prices, he said the administration should be ready to take some
sort of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is to let the market correct these disruptions and
that is my hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Saucer, an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in
Houston, said to be wary of reading too much into Richardson's
comments. He said the secretary's comments were ``mostly
political'' responses to concerns from congressmen from the
northeast who are worried about their constituents paying a lot for
heating oil this winter. Compared to 1986, when the price was also
$27 per barrel, Saucer said current prices aren't dangerous and
markets would eventually bring them down. The national economy is
stronger now, he said, and can weather high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Government intervention to dampen prices would be bad for
domestic producers struggling to attract investment, said Scott
Espenshade, vice president of economics at the Independent
Petroleum Association of America, a trade association representing
independent oil and gas producers. He cautioned against a use of
the strategic oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was set up for extreme supply problems, not price
fluctuations,'' Espenshade said. ``Prices were at 25 or 26 dollars
in 1996, and it didn't hinder economic expansion then.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that although the American economy is strong,
the department would be ``extremely concerned'' if oil prices rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets have corrected many of these problems in the past,
they are cyclical, but it's reaching the point because of several
geopolitical factors that I think we need to be prepared,''
Richardson said, likely referring to concerns over Iraq's
withholding of oil in a dispute with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson this afternoon met with Saudi Arabian oil minister
Ali I. Al-Naimi to discuss oil prices and U.S. plans to ready extra
reserves for the year 2000 turnover. A Department of Energy
spokesman said to his knowledge the two did not discuss the
American strategic oil reserves in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Sharief, director of energy research at Hornsby &AMP; Co. in
Houston, said he predicts prices will go higher - perhaps up to $30
a barrel - due to worsening shortages. At a point where producers
hit minimum operating level, Sharief said, OPEC would probably
produce more, making any U.S. government action unnecessary.

OPPONENTS OF BEN &AMP; JERRY'S TAKEOVER TAKE TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using the slogan ``multiflavors NOT multinationals,'' a local
opponent of the rumored sale of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. has
turned to the Internet to launch a grassroots campaign to keep the
premium ice cream giant from being scooped up by a large
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   From his Web site savebenjerry.com, launched earlier this week,
Garret LoPorto, 23, of Maynard, Mass., is asking people who want
the company to retain its independence to sign a petition against
what he calls ``the liquidation'' of the 21-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   Since its formation by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in 1978,
the company has been an activist for social causes, such as
recycling and international peace organizations, and a major
benefactor to environmental and community organizations, donating
7.5 percent of its pretax profits to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's ``is like a living, breathing organism that is
continually benefiting our planet and our communities through
social activism and humane business practices every day that it
survives,'' wrote LoPorto, whose company Quantumlight.com has
developed Web sites for the social causes Cohen has supported.
</P>
<P>
   LoPorto writes on his Web site, ``Unfortunately, today gigantic
multinational companies are trying to take advantage of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's undervalued stock price. They want to skin the company
alive and use its gentle lambskin brand identity to fool
unsuspecting consumers into purchasing their soulless profit-driven
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock rose more than 8 points on
reports that two companies _ rumored to be Unilever NV, the world's
biggest ice cream maker, and one of its two distributors, Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream _ each made offers to buy the South Burlington, Vt.
maker of ice cream and frozen yogurt, the nation's second largest.
Dreyers tried unsuccessfully to acquire Ben &AMP; Jerry's 22 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A third company, Italian ice cream maker Roncadin SpA, has also
bid, according to the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   LoPorto, who said he bought his first share of Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Homemade Thursday, has also listed the company on eBay, the large
on-line auction site, to grab publicity for his efforts to keep the
company independent. According to his eBay listing, buyers seeking
a controlling interest must be willing to pay $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``But hurry, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield can't hold out much
longer or they might get sued by their shareholders for trying to
protect the environment and the community with their company
instead of making a quick buck,'' noted LoPorto. So far no bidders
have responded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered the listing illegal, LaPorto said, ``I'm
not worried. I did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrystie Heimert, public relations manager at Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
said the company was aware of the Web site but had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The first demonstration to show support for keeping the company
independent is set for noon on Monday, according to David M.
Rapaport, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest
Research Group, whose members will picket in front of the Ben &AMP;
Jerry's shop in South Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking Ben &AMP; Jerry's not to sell out,'' said Rapaport.
``We think a potential sale of the company to a multinational
corporation will hit a nerve with Vermonters. If it is acquired, it
would mean a loss of local control, a loss to our economy,
particularly Vermont farmers. As for the demonstration, this is
Vermont and the tone will be friendly and festive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade closed down 5/16 at 26 1/4.

JESUS, SUPERSTAR OF ITALY'S JUBILEE, SHARES SPOTLIGHT WITH PINUPS
AND SITCOMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italy, the country that perfected housewife striptease
quiz shows, is better known for pizazz than for piety on
television.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 25, a Roman Catholic Holy Year, or Jubilee, begins,
one that coincides with what most Christians view as the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 20 million pilgrims expected to flood into Italy
to visit St. Peter's and other shrines, millions of Italians, and
especially tourist-phobic, traffic-fearing Romans, are planning to
stay indoors. But even on television, there will be little respite
from the Jubilee celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Turn-of-the-millennium specials, Holy Year documentaries, lives
of the saints, Bible stories and even sitcoms promoting spiritual
values are programmed on almost every channel. A foretaste, a
two-part mini-series entitled ``Jesus,'' ended on Monday on RAI,
the state-controlled network.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily promoted international production, which starred
Jacqueline Bisset as Mary and the American actor Robert Sisto as a
sunny, laid-back Jesus, drew 33.9 percent of viewers Sunday night.
The film won generally good reviews, but some critics complained
that the bloody crucifixion scene was too violent for younger
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other New Testament shows are planned. They come on
top of the special programming of RAI, the official Holy Year
broadcaster, which is committed to 200 hours of live Jubilee
programming, including live coverage of 80 events _ everything from
the opening of the Holy Door of St. Peter's on Christmas Eve, to a
papal Mass in May dedicated to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mediaset, a private network owned by Silvio Berlusconi, who
was prime minister of Italy in 1994, has joined in. Mediaset is the
company that in the 1980s introduced Colpo Grosso, ``The Big
Coup,'' a game show that had contestants stripping off their
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, Mediaset has commissioned its own life of Jesus,
starring yet another foreign actor, an Australian, Nicholas Rogers.
The two main networks also have dueling versions of the life of
Padre Pio, a mystic friar who was beatified this year and who has a
large following in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Mediaset is putting its own inimitable stamp on religious
programming with a series called ``Friends of Jesus'' concentrating
on the more sensational followers of Christ _ Mary Magdalen, played
by Maria Grazia Cuchinotta, a buxom brunette who played a Bond girl
in the latest 007 movie; St. Thomas, the doubting apostle, and
Judas, the betrayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the more conflicted characters; they lend themselves
better to drama,'' Francesco Nardella, head of dramatic production
for Mediaset, explained.
</P>
<P>
   But there are people who find the sheer number of Jubilee
specials excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a massive overdose _ Rome is turning into Tehran,''
complained Giovanni Negri, a member of the Lay Observatory of the
Jubilee, a watchdog group of lay citizens that monitors the
planning. ``It could have a boomerang effect. The Holy Year could
give rise to a new wave of anticlericalism among the young.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the staggering amount of Jubilee programming on
Italian TV is simple proximity to the Vatican. Jubilees, or Holy
Years, were introduced in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII, borrowing an
ancient Hebrew tradition of forgiving debts every 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Catholic Church called a Jubilee every 25 years, and
in Rome they are 12-month extravaganzas that involve not just the
church, but the state, city officials, museums, concert halls,
hotels, restaurants and souvenir vendors. In Rome, everything from
Vatican ashtrays to parchment papal blessings are for sale. (It is
a sin to sell papal blessings, and the Vatican fine print explains
that the fee, between $14 and $39, goes for covering the printing
and dealers' selling costs. The blessing itself is offered for
free.)
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to spare the sensibilities of religious pilgrims, the
city government has shut down sex shops and banned prurient
advertising near the Vatican. The Castello, an X-rated movie house
close to St. Peter's, has been turned into a Jubilee media center
by the government agency organizing the Year 2000 events.
</P>
<P>
   Television is not immune to the zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent panel discussion on RaiUno, RAI's first channel,
about whether there is too much sex on television, Carlo Rossella,
head of a Mediaset television news program ``Verissimo,'' proposed
a moratorium on racy shows during the Holy Year. But he may have
forgotten to inform his own network. Silvia Levato, a producer of
``In Bocca al Lupo'' _ a top-rated Mediaset evening game show,
whose name is an expression for ``Lotsa Luck'' and that is best
known for its scantily clad dancing girls _ grew indignant at the
suggestion that the program should clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the show _ how could we possibly change it?'' she
said. ``We are already a serious show. The dancers aren't naked,
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion has even sneaked into Italy's highly competitive sexy
calendar competition. For the first time, priests in Macerata, in
central Italy, introduced their own calendar: entitled ``Priests,''
each month features a different priest. All are fully dressed, but
Father February plays volleyball, and Father December playfully
straddles a playground rocking horse.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Bova, the handsome young actor Mediaset chose to play St.
Francis of Assisi, brought out his own cheesecake calendar this
month, but said he rejected full frontal nudity and also tried to
convey his innermost thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see my body, sure,'' he told the newspaper La Stampa.
``But I hope one can also see my point that we have to free
ourselves of the ties imposed by society.''
</P>
<P>
   Major Vatican events, like the Christmas Midnight Mass at St.
Peter's, have been broadcast live worldwide by satellite since
1974. There was live coverage of the last Jubilee, an extraordinary
one called by John Paul II in 1983. But the year 2,000 has a far
greater resonance, and technology allows for saturation coverage.
</P>
<P>
   RAI will broadcast the main events. SAT 2,000, a new satellite
TV network run by the Italian Bishops' Conference, will also
broadcast them in their entirety, as well as all Jubilee events,
even ones where the pope does not intend to appear. The network
also offers religious talk shows, news bulletins, a serial drama,
``Ciao Domani,'' that follows the tribulations of young women in a
boarding house in Rome. SAT 2000 will keep a camera on 24 hours a
day outside St. Peter's, interviewing pilgrims on the air.
</P>
<P>
   All the networks seem to be searching for a new sense of
propriety in the year 2000. But old habits die hard. Last week,
viewers of RaiUno were startled one morning by an R-rated Western,
``Hard Bounty,'' featuring a topless Kelly Le Brock, at 10:00 a.m.
Once alerted to the mistake, RAI hurriedly pulled the film off the
air and apologized to its viewers.

RUSSIANS ATTEMPT TO RESTORE NORMALCY TO CONQUERED CHECHEN AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZNAMENSKAYA, Russia _ Khava Kumarova still cries whenever she
hears the thunder of outgoing artillery, which unfortunately
happens very often.
</P>
<P>
   Kumarova, 8, is one of more than 100 refugee children from the
Chechen capital of Grozny who have been integrated into the classes
in the school in Znamenskaya. As the smiling pupils pose for
visitors outside the newly repaired school building, Major General
Vladimir Kovrov, the Russian military commander of northwestern
Chechnya, smiles back and hands out treats.
</P>
<P>
   But the school in this northwestern town in Chechnya is so close
to a Russian firing range, that every time the heavy guns let loose
with a new salvo, Kumarova shudders and begins to weep.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia presses ahead with its effort to reimpose its rule
over Chechnya, the army has embarked on a parallel campaign to show
how it is restoring life to normal in parts of the breakaway
Caucasus republic it has brought under its cotrol.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the veneer of friendly gestures, the Russian effort seems
more than a bit contrived, especially in contrast to the army's
darkly worded ultimatum to civilians trapped in Grozny, 30 miles to
the west.
</P>
<P>
   The school is part of Kovrov's guided tour of Znamenskaya,
intended to show visitors how well he has prepared for the influx
of refugees expected to arrive from Grozny before the military's
deadline for civilians to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the tour is an orphanage and a tent camp built
to accommodate new arrivals from the beseiged Chechen capital. The
facilities are clean and equipped with gas stoves, large washing
areas, and even a sauna. Built in 10 days, the tent city provides
stark contrast to the miserable conditions endured for the past two
months by tens of thousands of refugees from the fighting in the
neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   The camp in Znamenskaya is still empty _ even though the
military, in leaflets dropped on the city, warned civilians to
leave the capital by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kovrov, whose command includes the escape route for Grozny,
bristles at the idea that the lack of refugees so far is in any way
connected with the actions of Russian troops, who have not let up
in their bombardment of an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 separatist
militants holed up in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to leave can leave,'' Kovrov said. ``There is
no ultimatum. We are providing a corridior for safe passage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovrov's theory is that most civilians have left Grozny. Other
Russian officials, however, say that as many as 45,000 people, many
of them aged, ill, or with small children, could still be hiding in
the capital's basements.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Russian officials, Kovrov predicted a quick end to
the conflict in Chechnya, and said Chechen citizens will get help
from Moscow to rebuild their war-shattered homes and lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to work,'' Kovrov said. ``They are tired of war,
and that's why federal forces will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the strategic hamlets along the route leading from
Znamenskaya toward Grozny, a muddy road dotted with checkpoints
manned by heavily armed troops, found some Chechens who shared
Kovrov'sew.
</P>
<P>
   Many expressed disappointment that the de-facto independence won
after a 1994-1996 war with Russia did not turn into a better life.
Some blamed the separatist government of President Aslan Maskhadov
for its inability to restore Chechnya's economy, but many more
fingered rival gangs whose kidnapping and banditry paralyzed the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Chechens had high hopes, but they disappeared in a wave of
lawlessness,'' said Aisha, a vendor at a food market in the village
of Lakha-Nevre. Wary of two Russian policemen nearby, she asked not
to give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   Others quietly expressed anger at Russia for again bringing war
into their homeland. Moscow invaded the region in response to a
wave of apartment bombings and attacks on neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blame the Chechens for banditry, but the biggest bandits
are the Russians,'' said a man who gave his first name, Musa.
``They can occupy us, but they cannot defeat the Chechen spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time to visit the next stop on Kovrov's tour: a burning
oil well that he said fleeing Chechen rebels set ablaze, even
though early in the conflict, Russian commanders said their
warplanes had specifically targeted oil wells and refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Kovrov said it will take three months to cap the blaze, which is
wasting 1,400 barrels of oil a day and ruining the local
environment. As he spoke, two Russian Su-24 jets streaked overhead
on their way to bomb Grozny. A helicopter gunship prowled a nearby
ridge, and machine gun fire echoed across the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on the tour was the orphanage, where the children
sang Russian pop songsad danced across the spartan facility.
Someone asked the director, Benlan Kasayeva, to tell her visitors
how one boy's parents were killed by a radical Islamic group among
the rebels. She willingly obliged, even though the visibly
distraught boy was listening. Then she complained the Kovrov's
administration had yet to find money for the orphanage's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kasayeva's complaint got at the heart of the problem of Russia's
plans for the reconstruction of Chechnya. Orphanage staffs do not
get paid in Russia proper. Nor do teachers, retirees, and others,
at least not on time. If Chechnya has suffered from crime and
unemployment during its three years of independence, the standard
of living in the neighboring republic of North Ossetia, which has
been loyal to Moscow for two centuries, is not much better.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia's battle for the hearts and minds of Chechnya is to
succeed, it will have to work better here than in Russia itself.
Kovrov seemed to recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the military campaign is near,'' he said. ``But
that is only the beginning of our work here.''

INSURERS TO PAY $10 MILLION TO SETTLE R.I. OIL SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Insurance carriers for a barge that caused one of the
worst oil spills in New England history have agreed to pay $10
million to Rhode Island lobstermen, fishermen and business owners
who claimed the 1996 accident near Point Judith damaged their
livelihoods for years afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, subject to court approval, would resolve a
federal lawsuit filed by 114 individuals and businesses against
Eklof Marine Corp. of New York, whose barge North Cape spilled
800,000 gallons of home heating oil along the Rhode Island coast
when it ran aground.
</P>
<P>
   Though Eklof already has been fined a state record $8.5 million
in connection with the North Cape accident, lobstermen and
fishermen had been frustrated in their effort to get compensation
for marine resources destroyed in the spill. Point Judith
lobstermen reported catches dropped by up to 50 percent in the year
after the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can never fully compensate all the lobstermen for all of
their losses, but this is a good settlement and a fair
settlement,'' said Thomas Cole, the attorney at Kirkpatrick &AMP;
Lockhart who represented the lobstermen, fishermen and
fishing-related businesses in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The North Cape split open on Jan. 20, 1996, near one of southern
New England's most important fishing ports after the tugboat that
was towing it caught fire and had to be abandoned. Dead lobsters,
starfish and other animals washed ashore by the thousand as the oil
slick spread.
</P>
<P>
   Eklof agreed to pay huge fines to settle criminal charges after
investigators learned that the tugboat did not have proper
firefighting equipment despite a history of fires on the vessel. In
addition, the captain sailed despite forecasts of rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the settlement did little for people whose livelihoods
were damaged by the spill. Reforms adopted by Congress after the
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill were supposed to make it easier for oil
spill victims to negotiate damages, but the North Cape victims said
talks stalled over the issue of long-term impacts of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cruel paradox is that the settlement process envisioned by
Congress proved to be more grueling than protracted litigation and
that's why we were forced to go to the courthouse,'' said Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's settlement, the plaintiffs will divide $10
million from Eklof's insurance companies for damages since 1997.
They have already been promised more than $2 million from insurers
as well as an oil industry fund to cover 1996 damages.

 &HT;    New buildings to house growth, attract top talent for Turner
Broadcasting
 &HT;    Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting plans to begin a $90 million
construction project early next year at its downtown Atlanta campus
that will add two new office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The development is aimed at accommodating the company's rapid
growth and is helping recruit top talent to the company's
entertainment channels, which are based at the site, as well as
signaling the company's commitment to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The project calls for Turner Broadcasting to retool its site
into a suburban-style office campus in the heart of the city.
Company executives hope this type of work environment will attract
top people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to promote Atlanta as a great place to work and
live,'' says Alec Fraser, president of Turner Properties, who is
leading the $90 million project.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly expanding television programming business is based
primarily in New York and Los Angeles. Turner Broadcasting has
always had to work harder than its competition to attract talent to
its Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting's site is already densely settled with four
office buildings housing the operations for the company's TNT, TBS,
Turner Classic Movies and Cartoon Network channels.
</P>
<P>
   The site abuts Georgia Tech on Techwood Drive between 14th and
10th streets. About 1,400 employees work at the site and that
number is expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the company launched its newest channel, Turner
South, from the Techwood site. The next addition to the Techwood
campus will be a $35 million studio, expected to open early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 2000, the company plans to launch Boomerang, an offshoot
of Cartoon Network that will feature cartoons 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The new buildings will total 330,000 square feet of office
space. They will be built on top of the two parking lots that now
flank the front of the site's cornerstone building, a white
columned brick mansion, the original home of CNN. A fountain now in
front of the mansion will become a courtyard. Parking will be built
under each building. The idea is to preserve the leafy and hilly
campuslike feel of the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect the two hills that are on the site,
keep the best of the environment and maximize the use of land,''
says Fraser. ``There will be no parking decks to block the view of
our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   As designed by local firm KSP Group, the buildings will be built
of brick, stone and glass. The idea behind the design is a
contemporary look that incorporates a touch of the original
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The style is a cross between the classical and the modern,''
says Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings will be constructed by Turner Construction, which
built the new studio. The builder is no relation to either Turner
Broadcasting or its founder, Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The first building is largely a technical facility. It will be
designed to incorporate the latest in digital television
transmission technology, including high definition technology. Only
the top two floors of the building's six stories will house
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The second building, five stories high, will house the company's
network operations employees.
</P>
<P>
   Said Fraser, ``the two buildings will be highly visible from the
street and should make quite an impression.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Gudermes, Russia) _ Russian officials vow to
return the flood of refugees in Ingushetiya back to

appears intended to demonstrate that Russia is making process in
stabilizing Chechnya and that talk of a human disaster is

GROUPS ANNOUNCE CAMPAIGN TO `DE-ALERT' NUKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of defense experts, lawmakers and
liberal organizations launched a nationwide campaign Thursday aimed
at getting the United States and Russia to remove their nuclear
missiles from high alert _ that is, ready to launch on a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's effort to get both nations to ``de-alert'' their
weapons is surfacing because it believes that after years of
neglect Russia's early-warning radars are in such disrepair and the
troops that guard intercontinental ballistic missiles are so
demoralized that the missiles could be accidentally or purposefully
launched at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One possible nightmare scenario is that faulty Russian radars
will relay inaccurate information to Kremlin leaders saying that
they are under nuclear attack and Moscow will respond with a volley
of nuclear missiles at the United States. Another feared scenario
is that Russia will plummet into political anarchy and troops,
demoralized after a decade of economic chaos, will wrest control of
a few missiles from civilian leaders and make an unauthorized
launch against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, a Russian nuclear weapons expert at the nonpartisan
Brookings Institution here, says the dangers are increasing daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main current threat to our mutual survival stems from the
growing risk that weapons on a hair-trigger alert will be fired
illicitly or accidentally because of technical failure, human error
or internal military and political disintegration,'' he said at a
news conference announcing the de-alert campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign believes that keeping nuclear arsenals on high
alert makes little sense in the post-Cold War era, that it runs
inherent safety risks and that these risks are growing as the
result of the deterioration of Russian control and early warning,''
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was announced by Blair, the Center for Defense
Information (CDI), a liberal think tank, and Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., sponsor of a congressional measure signed by 83 other
lawmakers to de-alert U.S. nuclear missiles. Also joining the
effort are the Takoma Park, Md.-based Institute for Energy and
Environmental Research, the Snake River Alliance in Idaho and the
Federation of American Scientists here.
</P>
<P>
   Activists in the campaign are distributing videotapes about the
perceived nuclear dangers and are circulating a grass-roots
Internet petition (www.DEALERT.org) that asks the political leaders
of both countries to ``stand down our weapons of mass
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists are seeking the removal of the missiles' warheads
and guidance systems or the covering of silos with large amounts of
dirt that would have to be removed before a launch. In this way, it
would take hours to prepare a missile for flight. While Presidents
Clinton and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an agreement in 1994 not
to aim missiles at each other's country, the weapons remain loaded
with nuclear warheads and could be activated in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear policy of both sides is still pegged to Cold War
hostilities with Moscow and Washington maintaining the ability to
launch their respective atomic arsenals minutes after detecting a
nuclear attack from the other side. The idea is to fire a
retaliatory salvo before the incoming missiles strike. It is known
as the ``use them or lose them'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States needs to take the leadership on this issue
and take the first step,'' said CDI's director, former Democratic
Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers. ``We will have the moral and political
basis on which to ask Russia to reciprocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said in a statement that the ``weapons should not sit
like cars at a drag race with revved engines waiting for the start
light to turn green.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency said it doubts Russia
will launch a preemptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We judge that an unauthorized or accidental launch of a
Russian strategic missile is highly unlikely so long as current
technical and procedural safeguards are in place,'' said Robert D.
Walpole, a nuclear expert at the agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, because of concern that Y2K computer glitches in Russia
could result in an accidental missile launch, the governments of
the two nuclear powers have set up a joint command center at
Peterson Air Force Base near the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   While officials from both countries stress the likelihood is
remote for such a deadly exchange, the command post has a simple if
important mission: assure Russia _ where aging military computers
haven't been upgraded for years _ that a U.S. attack is not under
way if Moscow's early warning system malfunctions and indicates an
imminent strike.

   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (8-4) vs. Tampa Bay (8-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Lions and Bucs are rejuvenated, Detroit spurned by balance
and commitment and Tampa Bay by the league's top-ranked defense.
Detroit plays defense, too. Last season it created 21 takeaways; it
already has 24 (10 interceptions, 14 fumble recoveries) this year.
The Bucs rookie quarterback, Shaun King, vs. the Lions defense, led
by end Robert Porcher, gives Detroit an edge. Detroit coach Bobby
Ross is 6-3 vs. Tampa Bay and his counterpart, Tony Dungy, is 2-6
vs. Detroit. Incentive for both _ the divisional lead with three
games left _ is supreme. Detroit wins the battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (6-6) vs. Washington (7-5)
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago Arizona was a lousy team, scratching its head
and demoralized. Now the Cardinals are refreshed. They have won
four straight and no Cardinals team has done that in 11 years. Jake
Plummer has resurfaced after a painful start. In his last two games
he has completed 32 of 55 passes for 304 yards with 3 touchdowns.
The Redskins have been a yo-yo team _ brilliant one week, ordinary
the next _ all season. It is time for brilliance after a collapse
at Detroit last week. It does not look like, however, the Redskins
have it in them.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (5-7) vs. Pittsburgh (5-7)
</P>
<P>
   This is the Pittsburgh's fifth consecutive divisional game. It
lost the last four. Mike Tomczak starts at quarterback again for
Pittsburgh and he finds a team not prepared to rally around him.
Pittsburgh is close to losing its heart for this season and its
hope. A victory is crucial to salvage an even more severe tailspin.
Can Pittsburgh run at Baltimore with Jerome Bettis? It meets a
Baltimore defense that ranks first in the AFC allowing an average
of 80.8 yards per game. Baltimore has not allowed a 100-yard rusher
this season. Look for that streak to continue as well as the
big-play production of Baltimore quarterback Tony Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 25-20.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (5-7) vs. Green Bay (7-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers were smoked by the Rams last week, ripped for 34
points and shoved aside as a team with more holes than strengths.
It could get ugly at Lambeau Field. Green Bay is beginning its
playoff drive with a resolve and focus that could take it far.
Certainly past the Panthers. Green Bay's rookie running backs _
Basil Mitchell and De'mond Parker _ provide quickness and a spunky
change of pace. Green Bay has won three straight by a combined
score of 81-39. That's an average score of 27-13 per victory.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 27-13.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (2-11) vs. Cincinnati (3-10)
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Bengals looked like a dog team headed for a 1-15
season, they won two straight and started blowing up defenses like
their fans thought they could all season long. In their last three
games, the Bengals have averaged 34 points per game; in their first
10 they averaged 13 points per game. What happened? Jeff Blake
began throwing deep downfield once again, Bruce Coslet loosened his
coaching reins and let the Bengals create. This is a common trend.
The Bengals are lousy for three months and then fly in December
when all hope for the playoffs is lost. They are 8-4 in December
games under Coslet and he is 3-0 vs. the Browns. There is little
chance he will survive this latest Bengals stretch of mediocrity,
so, as a parting shot, he makes it 4-0 vs. the Browns. Bengals,
30-17.
</P>
<P>
   New England (7-5) vs. Indianapolis (10-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots beat the Colts, 31-28 in September. It was a game
where New England trailed 28-7 at halftime. New England will be
hard-pressed to duplicate that comeback. Indianapolis has gained
confidence in beating nearly all comers, especially in its
dramatic, last-second victory last week at Miami. That road victory
gave the Colts all they needed in psyche to roll the rest of the
way toward their divisional crown. Players like Peyton Manning,
Marvin Harrison, Cornelius Bennett and kicker Mike Vanderjagt (a
league-most 114 points) provide the rest in production.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (6-6) vs. Buffalo (8-4)
</P>
<P>
   Rested but perhaps rusted, the Bills tackle the Giants new,
one-game, high-rolling offense. Will it sputter and clank in the
cold of Buffalo? Maybe not. The Giants will give the ball again to
back Joe Montgomery and the new play-calling and emphasis on
breaking old tendencies will work in the Giants favor. Expect Kerry
Collins to outplay Doug Flutie and the Giants defense to overwhelm
the Bills' defense. The Giants should start quickly while the Bills
work through their one-week layoff. This game could be won in large
part in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (3-10) vs. Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has produced a season much like Washington's with extreme
highs and lows, with sparkling play followed by a breakdowns both
mental and physical. Dallas lost the first one to Philadelphia
13-10 back in October but won't make the same mistake. It must have
this game to keep pace with the Giants and Cardinals and maybe will
catch Washington. Often the Eagles are their own nemesis. How can a
team that leads the NFC in takeaways have a turnover differential
of Zero? Easy. It kicks the ball around as much as it recovers it.
Dallas will exploit that this time.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 17-9.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (10-2) vs. New Orleans (2-10)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka, the Saints coach, met this week with Saints owner
Tom Benson. Benson left that meeting saying that after this season
he would do whatever he could to ensure winning Saints football.
Notice the words ``after this season.'' The season is shot. It
began with the promise and glow of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams. It spun out of control with Williams often hurt and with
the Saints in disarray. As this woeful season ticks away, it is
apparent this one is Ditka's last one in New Orleans. The Rams
provide another painful punctuation mark.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 33-16.

<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Miami (8-4) vs. Jets (4-8)
</P>
<P>
   How can the Jets have a plus 10 turnover differential and be a
4-victory team and the Colts have a -2 turnover differential and be
a 10-victory team? Oh, we could forever count the ways. The biggest
problem is offense and touchdown and point production. The Colts
have it; the Jets do not. But last week, the Jets defense fell
flat, too, in a 41-point Giants offensive showing. This game spells
trouble for the Jets. Two teams heading in totally opposite
directions. Miami toward the playoffs; the Jets to an offseason of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 13-9.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (5-7) vs. Seattle (8-4)
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harbaugh has quarterbacked the Chargers with a steady hand
and has given his team a jolt. But the Chargers need so much more.
They often find themselves standing rather than creating, chasing
rather than being chased, trailing rather than leading. The
Chargers tackle a team that is smarting, especially after the
Raiders cut them and carved them last week. Momentum is slipping
for Seattle, but Seattle recaptures it with a solid game where
every phase of its team contributes.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 30-17.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (3-9) vs. San Francisco (3-9)
</P>
<P>
   Both the Falcons and the 49ers find their offenses finally
improving, showing life, scoring points. The good news for Atlanta
is its defense is making that good for something. The bad news for
San Francisco is its defense is not. The 49ers scored 30 points,
Jeff Garcia threw for 437 yards and three touchdowns, Jerry Rice
caught two scores, Terrell Owens caught nine passes for 145 yards _
and the 49ers still lost to the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals
torched the 49ers for 44 points. How many will Atlanta get? Enough
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (7-5) vs. Kansas City (7-5)
</P>
<P>
   Cris Carter is Minnesota's leading receiver. Tony Gonzalez at
tight end is the Chiefs' leading receiver. That tells you plenty
about the differences in these two offenses. The Vikings sprint,
the Chiefs plod. But Kansas City, especially at home, has a way of
making offenses crawl. The Chiefs at home and in a special night
affair start the game with big, bruising hits and then continue
throughout the night. They will attempt to pulverize the Vikings
offense into submission. A tall task. So, the Chiefs will need help
from their offense and especially from quarterback Elvis Grbac to
keep pace. The Chiefs surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 24-22.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Denver (4-8) vs. Jacksonville (11-1)
</P>
<P>
   This game in recent years has been for huge stakes but now it
has fizzled because Denver collapsed early this season and could
never get up. It fought, but adversity and poor play and a less
cohesive team unit helped doom this team to an unfamiliar and
draining bottom-rung position after consecutive Super Bowl titles.
Jacksonville arrives ready to dump more dirt on Denver. These
franchises have testy history between them including a touch of
envy and a general dislike. Jacksonville can run it up as much as
it likes. It won't stop for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 36-20.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ And how would you like your swing dancing this
evening, folks? Just straight up, in the manner of the big-band
era? Or would you prefer something a tad more exotic _ say, in the
style of a square dance or a pajama party? Or how about something
really wild, with dancers who punningly swing from a contraption
made of bungee cords?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's all on the menu in ``Swing!,'' the new musical revue
that takes its exclamation point seriously. And rest assured that
each number will be cheerfully packaged in upbeat colors and served
with a very big smile.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, dear. In the new, improved and unapologetically square Times
Square area, it is getting ever harder to distinguish between the
tourist-luring themed restaurants and the tourist-luring themed
shows that are slowly taking over the neighborhood like batallions
of chipper Mouseketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Blues, midcentury rebel rock 'n' roll, the incendiary
choreography of Bob Fosse, the subversive songs of Stephen
Sondheim: all are being offered on Broadway at the moment in
smooth, synthetic puddings of shows that carefully remove the sting
and sharpness from their original material.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is ``Swing!,'' which opened Thursday night at the St.
James Theater, with direction and choreography by Lynne
Taylor-Corbett. With its eager, limber cast moving to the gleaming
sounds of a fine band called the Gotham City Gates, it is by no
means the worst of the lot. But when you start remembering the cats
of ``Cats'' as a group of revolutionary hipsters, it may be time to
retreat from the revue circuit for a while and let your taste buds
grow back.
</P>
<P>
   In the days of supper clubs and rooftop night spots, the kind so
glamorously represented in early talking pictures set in Manhattan,
``Swing!'' might have been a floor show, an entertainment to serve
as a background for cocktails and small talk. Dragged into the
foreground and made the single focus of attention for two hours,
``Swing!,'' which features the cabaret singer Ann Hampton Callaway,
passes as a slick, bland blur.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the production _ which pays homage to the big-band
music that reached its popular zenith during World War II _ as
``Smokey Joe's Canteen,'' the latest variation on the format of
``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' the long-running revue that set the tone for
the new breed of sanitized song-and-dance shows. (It isn't
coincidental that Jerry Zaks, who directed ``Cafe,'' is credited as
the production supervisor of ``Swing!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' took the rock and pop hits of Leiber and
Stoller from the 1950s and '60s and bleached them of their danger
quotient, of their raunch and sass. People who grew up listening to
that music could leave the show thinking that their youth had been
rather wholesome, really, while younger audience members hadn't
been given a hint of the convention-baiting sexuality that had so
outraged their parents' parents.
</P>
<P>
   The music resurrected in ``Swing!,'' a style associated with
big-band leaders like Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and Harry James,
was less divisive; it appealed to a wider range of age groups. But
it, too, was the music of youth, and it shaped the way a whole
generation not only danced but also talked and dressed. Although
Benny Goodman may have looked like a CPA, he was once as cool as
Puff Daddy is today.

   WASHINGTON _ If Vice President Al Gore wins the Democratic
presidential nomination, it will be because of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Should he stumble in the early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire,
``Al Gore has looked at the primary calendar and has calculated,
clearly, that the South is where he either wins or stops a rout,''
said Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University in Texas
and co-author of ``The Vital South: How Presidents Are Elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile outlines the primary
strategy against former Sen. Bill Bradley this way: ``Win Iowa, do
very, very well in New Hampshire, make him defend his base in the
East and force Bradley to come South, where we take him on and beat
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gore rarely lets a week pass without tending to
his Southern political base _ especially African Americans, who
make up 40 percent of the Southern Democratic primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, for example, Gore will be meeting with black voters
at the Auburn Avenue offices of Atlanta Life Insurance Co., the
largest African-American-controlled stockholder-owned life
insurance firm.
</P>
<P>
   At that event, Gore is expected to renew criticism that
Bradley's health care proposals could deplete the federal surplus
and jeopardize ``progressive priorities'' that are important to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   From Atlanta, the vice president flies to Orlando to address the
Florida State Democratic Convention. Florida is one of the Southern
states where Bradley strategists believe they can make inroads, and
Bradley is set to speak to the Florida convention before Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the vice president has some advantages in the
South, but we are organizing,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is likely to be intense, because whoever wins
the South is likely to win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most media attention is on the leadoff contests, in Iowa on
Jan. 24 and New Hampshire on Feb. 1. But after those states come
two ``Super Tuesday'' contests in March that could determine the
nomination winner.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these contests, on March 7, is virtually a national
primary with 14 states casting ballots, including the two largest,
California and New York. Also voting that day is Georgia, which
could provide the first indication of how the South is leaning.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later comes South Carolina, another Southern state
where Bradley strategists see possibilities of cracking Gore's
Southern strategy. Gov. Jim Hodges and Charleston Mayor Joseph
Riley, two of the state's most prominent Democrats, are neutral.
</P>
<P>
   And March 14 is the second ``Super Tuesday'' _ a Dixie fest that
features Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee,
Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   By the second Tuesday in March, about 70 percent of the
Democratic Party's convention delegates will have been allocated
between the two candidates. And more than one out of four delegates
to that point will be from the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strength in the South is ``formidable'' in the Democratic
primary, said Merle Black, an Emory University professor and
co-author of ``The Vital South'' with his brother. The largely
white Democratic Party establishment ``knows him well,'' Black
added, and a majority of party officeholders have endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Though polls show he is the overwhelming favorite of black
voters, Gore is not taking the African American vote for granted.
His courtship of blacks has been surprisingly intense, in fact,
given the popularity of President Clinton among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore started out his campaign declaring a ``personal
connection'' to the civil rights struggle led by the late Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Last month, in the same Memphis pulpit from
which King prophesied his own death in 1968, Gore characterized his
presidential campaign as a force for good ``against evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the vice president is drawing criticism for such
rhetoric. His critics say he often tries to smear political
adversaries as racists.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has been a leader of the race-baiting pack'' in the
Democratic Party, Stuart Taylor Jr., a senior writer for the
National Journal, wrote in the influential political magazine this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was incensed by Gore's often graphic descriptions of hate
crimes in his speeches and by Gore's failure to admonish two senior
campaign advisers for recent comments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Brazile, an African American, who vowed in a Washington Post
interview to defeat the ``white boys'' in the 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feminist author Naomi Wolf, who claimed last month on ABC's
``This Week'' that ``George (W.) Bush's advisers'' have ``racist''
views.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has long been popular with African Americans, largely
the result of his passion for improving race relations, born of his
long and successful career in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Sunday, in a sermon to a black church in Iowa, he
promised an administration that would ``set a tone in the air''
promoting racial unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, too, as a senator and congressman from Tennessee, has
a solid record of support for civil rights initiatives. ``Al Gore
has a history of being there,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a
civil rights pioneer and Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988,
however, Gore ran as the great hope of white conservative Southern
Democrats after the disastrous defeat of Walter Mondale in the 1984
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Democrats engineered the Southern-dominated ``Super
Tuesday'' Democratic primary in 1988 in an effort to wrest control
of the national party from liberals and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore fell far short of expectations in 1988, winning just
under 26 percent of the vote and six of the 19 states in the
``Super Tuesday'' primary that year. The then-Tennessee senator was
hurt by the high turnout of black voters who lifted the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to victory in five states, also with 26 percent of the
primary vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of 'Super Tuesday's' black vote became obvious
in 1988,'' said former Republican National Committee strategist
John Pitney, now a political science professor at Claremont McKenna
College in California. ``The big loser that night was none other
than Al Gore. He learned.''

 NEW YORK: is today.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cool factor, however, is as conspicuously absent from
``Swing!'' as it was from ``Smokey Joe's.'' Mixing classic works by
musicians like Duke Ellington and Johnny Mercer with new pastiche
pieces, the show (even the World War II canteen sequences) seems to
take place in some squeaky-clean, confectionary limbo, reflected in
the candy-colored sets and lighting of Thomas Lynch and Kenneth
Posner, respectively. Even when the energy is at full throttle,
there's a distancing quality of preciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Those hoping to catch a glimmer of the original visceral impact
of swing dancing would do better to check out Susan Stroman's
``Contact,'' which translates the style into contemporary terms in
its second act. Ms. Stroman's choreography can be as sleekly
synchronized as anything in ``Swing!,'' but it also emphasizes the
distinct personalities of its dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing!,'' on the other hand, is strongest in its big ensemble
pieces, especially its opening and closing numbers, that dazzle by
turning a multitude of performers into one well-oiled dance
machine. While Ms. Taylor-Corbett generously credits the dancers
who created their own routines in the show, there is surprisingly
little flavor of individual styles. It's the conceptual gimmicks
that matter in each of the show's segments, the bungee cords and
the bedroom slippers that turn out to be tap shoes. And for the
most part, they're too darn cute.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest attempts have been made to present swing as a sensual
liberator, a force that brings out the looseness in the uptight.
The metamorphosis is repeated ad infinitum. The singer Laura
Benanti melts from a stiff, operatic soprano into a jivin' chick,
while her dress is similarly transformed before our eyes. (The
bright, athletic costumes are by William Ivey Long.)
</P>
<P>
   A nerdlike Everett Bradley drops his briefcase to learn to
``throw that girl around,'' while a plump country-western type
(Robert Royston) finds romance when he starts to swing. In each
case, the progression is less from square to hip than from perky to
perkier.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a more authentically erotic element sneaks in, or
a whiff of maverick character. Carlos Sierra-Lopez and Maria Torres
deliver a torrid lesson in swing, Latin style. Scott Fowler's
angular dancing conveys an appealing emotional jaggedness, although
I certainly could have lived without the prissy swing ballet he has
been given.
</P>
<P>
   The long-stemmed Caitlin Carter, who was a vividly wry presence
in the current revival of ``Chicago,'' brings cool heat to her
impersonation of a bass fiddle (in Earl H. Hagen's ``Harlem
Nocturne'' with Conrad Korsch playing the bass) and to a steamy
duet with the strapping Edgar Godineaux to the great Arlen-Mercer
standard ``Blues in the Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Callaway provides the aural backdrop for this pas de deux,
as pianist and vocalist, and her full-throated interpretation here
is her finest contribution to the show. Otherwise, with her
'70s-style layered haircut and tailored pantsuits, she is a most
unswinging presence, suggesting a no-nonsense career mom who
happens to have this amazing talent for sounding like musical
instruments. And her scat duets with Bradley, in which they play a
pair of squabbling lovers, are surreal in ways that were surely
never intended.
</P>
<P>
   Of the show's soloists, who also include Michael Gruber, only
Casey MacGill, the ukulele-strumming band leader, has the kind of
shrugged-off charm one associates with being cool in the swing era.
And the musicians, conducted by the pianist Jonathan Smith, sound
swell, although the ways they're used to create dialogue between
instruments and performers can cloy.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that the evening's high point is performed without
dancers or singers. That's the band's version of Duke Ellington and
Juan Tizol's ``Caravan,'' which blissfully embodies the idea of
swing as a collective effort in which each individual voice (i.e.,
each instrument) has its say. In this sense, it's the American
Dream incarnate, and the show's one persuasive reminder of a time
when patriotism, far from being corny, was positively hip.

 &HT;    Barr calls for probe into HUD's part in suit against gunmakers
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rep. Bob Barr is calling for an investigation into the
federal government's plan to take part in a suit against gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Barr wants to know whether a Housing Department
lawyer lied to Congress about taking such legal action.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gail Laster, counsel at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, told a House panel that the department ``does
not plan to bring any action on its own against the gun industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a board member of the National Rifle Association, contends
that Laster's statement amounts to ``misleading, if not lying'' to
the House Government Reform's panel on criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Barr has asked the chairman of that panel, Rep. John Mica
(R-Fla.), to investigate whether Laster acted on her own or whether
this is part of a ``department policy to lie to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect example of the way the Clinton
Administration works,'' Barr said on Thursday. ``These people come
up here and they are basically thumbing their nose at Congress.
They're saying: `We're going to tell you whatever we want. We're
not going to tell the truth, and then we're going to go back and do
whatever we want.' That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Housing officials have a starkly different memory of
Laster's April 4th testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Laster did tell the panel that the federal housing
agency had no plans to file suit against the gun industry. But she
did not rule out that a suit would be filed by one of the some 3
million people who live in public housing developments across the
country or by a local housing authority.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what is expected to happen when the federal
action is finally filed. The suit will be brought by a small band
of public housing residents or a group of individual housing
authorities and it will have the support of the federal agency,
according to HUD.
</P>
<P>
   In filing a lawsuit against gunmakers, the Clinton
administration is attempting to support the 29 cities and counties,
including Atlanta, across the country that have sued the gun
industry in hopes of winning monetary damages for the cost of
gun-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   The gun debate on Capitol Hill is expected to unfold again in
January with both chambers drafting legislation aimed at curbing
gun violence. The momentum for gun legislation came from a series
of recent shooting sprees in California, Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates applaud the Clinton administration's
action, saying it is time to hold the gun industry accountable in
the same way that the tobacco industry has been taken to task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Barr's protestations of this lawsuit are as ludicrous as
they are predictable,'' said Adam Eisgraw, director of federal
relations for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a nonprofit
organization based in Washington, D.C. ``The notion that Americans
should not use the judicial branch to address a problem as severe
as guns is preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry is lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in
state legislatures to prevent more lawsuits from being filed.
Already they have convinced 14 states, including Georgia, to pass
legislation preventing local governments from taking legal action
against gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the lawsuits are wrongheaded,'' said Bill Powers,
director of public affairs for the NRA. ``Who's next? General
Motors for causing drunk driving?''

DEMOCRATS ACCUSE GOP LEADERS OF VIOLATING FEDERAL CAMPAIGN LAWS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats accused House Majority Whip Tom DeLay and
other Republican leaders Thursday of violating federal campaign
laws by funneling money into several independent groups in order to
avoid campaign donation and spending limits in next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission,
lawyers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
asserted that DeLay, R-Texas, and the National Republican
Congressional Committee had devised an illegal ``scheme'' to create
and fund ``a web of organizations'' that are not required to
disclose their donors or how they spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, the complaint said, would allow Republican donors to
contribute more to the NRCC than the $20,000 limit by giving to the
outside groups. It would also make it easier for NRCC to spend more
``soft money'' on campaign advertising and get-out-the-vote drives
than allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   By off-loading ``huge segments of its own activities to groups
that play under more permissive rules,'' the Democrats said the
NRCC will be able ``to do what it may not do on its own'' under
current law governing how much the parties can spend on advertising
and get-out-the-vote drives funded by so-called ``soft money''
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which urges the FEC to investigate and seek a
court order prohibiting the NRCC from working with the groups, also
alleges that the organizations involved are actually controlled by
DeLay and run by his former aides and political associates,
including his former chief of Staff Ed Buckham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The web of DeLay operatives and NRCC consultants running these
operations all point to an ongoing relationship and the creation of
an entity affiliated with the NRCC,'' the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   As the third-ranking GOP leader in the House, Delay has become
one of the most influential lawmakers on Capitol Hill. By wielding
his political power and strong conservative credentials, he has
also emerged this year as the GOP's top fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that he has become an ``easy target,'' his
aides say, for criticism from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spokesman Michael Scanlon called the Democratic complaint
``absolutely false'' and accused the Democrats of pulling a
political ``publicity stunt'' designed to make Republicans, and
DeLay in particular, look bad to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Mattoon, the NRCC deputy chairman, also said in a statement
that there was nothing illegal about the committee giving to
``pro-family groups.``
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what the law is and the NRCC always complies
with the letter and spirit of the law,'' Mattoon said, calling the
Democratic charges ``baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic complaint to the FEC was prompted by an article
earlier this week in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, which
reported that the NRCC had given $500,000 to U.S. Family Network,
one of three independent, non-profit groups associated with DeLay
and run by his former aides or political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Family Network has reportedly applied to the Internal
Revenue Service for tax-exempt status as a non-profit social
organization. The other two groups are the Republican Majority
Issue Conference, which many Republicans acknowledge is a
DeLay-NRCC fund-raising arm, and Americans for Economic Growth,
which is also a non-profit, tax-exempt organization.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the NRCC has given money to the RMIC or
AEG. But both groups make no secret of the fact that they rely on
DeLay and other Republican leaders for help in their fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, the Democrats allege that all three groups are
nothing more than surrogates of the NRCC and should be forced to
register with the FEC and abide by federal election laws that
govern political parties and their affiliated organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans argue that neither DeLay, nor NRCC Chairman Tom
Davis, R-Va., are involved in deciding how the organizations should
spend the money they receive, despite their obvious ties to the
directors of the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has no involvement in their decisions,'' said Scanlon.
``That's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FEC declined to comment directly on the DCCC
charges. But as with most complaints it receives, FEC officials
will likely ask DeLay and the NRCC to respond to the charges within
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the response, Meredith McGehee, legislative
director for the public interest group Common Cause, says the FEC
is ``not going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the agency charged with enforcing campaign laws ``a
toothless tiger'' in a political system awash in huge amounts of
money with very little accountability about how it's spent and
little impetus to actually strengthen the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although she noted that a case could easily be made that
Democrats use outside groups themselves to skirt campaign finance
laws, she said the DCCC complaint indicates that Republicans have
all but dropped any pretense of trying to stay within the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very clearly here an effort to exploit this enormous
amount of soft money flowing into the system ... DeLay is at the
center of many these efforts,'' McGehee said, citing DeLay's
leadership position in Congress and his strong connections with
Washington lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is obviously a money king-pin in the system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon called McGehee's comments ``inflammatory,'' saying
``that doesn't help anything.'' He suggested that Common Cause
``ought to be trying to create a more respectable discourse'' on
campaign finance reform.

KING DECISION BRINGS COMFORT TO FAMILY, DOES LITTLE FOR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ Beneath the motel balcony where a sniper's bullet
killed the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., a granite plaque has
long borne a Biblical passage that hints at one of his family's
gravest beliefs: His assassin did not act alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behold, here cometh the dreamer,'' the inscription says. ``Let
us slay him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader's dream of justice was alive Thursday,
members of his family said, because a jury on Wednesday accepted
their premise that King's assassination was not the solitary work
of James Earl Ray, a petty thief convicted of the killing, but the
heinous product of a vast conspiracy masterminded and covered up by
the Mafia and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its blockbuster potential, the civil jury's verdict
appeared destined to languish as a footnote in history. Beyond
providing vague confirmation for what many Americans already
suspected, the jury's finding was expected to represent little more
than final consolation for King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and
the couple's four children as they end their quest for the truth in
the 1968 tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   King's survivors said they will not push for dional action,
depte plans by some of their closest allies to seek afuller
inquiry. State and federal prosecrs said they will not reopen
criminal investigations because of the verdict. And at the site of
King's assassination, now the National Civil Rights Museum,
officials said they will add only a sentence about the verdict, if
that, to the story of the martyred leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared now to move on with our lives,'' Mrs. King
said at a news conference in Atlanta. ``We hope that other people
will join us so the nation can move on with the healing that is so
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members, with a trace of bitterness, said the verdict had
even sqeulched their interest in a Justice Department inquiry into
a possible conspiracy to kill King _ an investigation that Mrs.
King had personally lobbied President Clinton to open last year.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday the 15-month
inquiry will be completed in the next few weeks, although he
downplayed expectations that the limited investigation would break
significant new ground. ``It's not a very broad-based look at all
the possibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Dexter King said, ``We don't care what the Justice
Department does . . . We believe this case is over. We know what
happened. This is the period at the end of the sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he described the alleged conspiracy as ``the most
incredible cover-up of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, issued after a month-long trial in a county court
in Memphis, is likely to invigorate conspiracy buffs who have been
frustrated f decades by what they perceive as the government's
failure to fully investigate a number of potentially explosive
cases, most notably the assassinations of King and President John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of six whites and six blacks found that Loyd Jowers,
73, who owned Jim's Grill a floor below the rooming house from
which Ray allegedly shot King on April 4, 1968, helped ``others,
including government agencies'' assassinate King and frame Ray. The
verdict came in a civil suit the Kings filed against Jowers after
he said publicly that he hired King's unnamed killer as favor to a
Mafia figure who was his friend.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, William Pepper, a lawyer for the Kings,
said the US Army had a sniper squad poised to shoot King if the
Mafia operative failed. And he asserted that the FBI, CIA, Army
intelligence, and Memphis police helped to cover up the conspiracy.
All the government agencies have denied playing any role in King's
death or a coverup, and none of their representatives was called to
testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper once represented Ray, who pleaded guilty to the
assassination in 1968 and received a 99-year sentence. Ray quickly
recanted his confession, but he died in prison in 1998 after
failing eight times to receive a jury trial on the murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper has drawn considerable criticism for his conspiracy
theory of King's death, which the King family embraced though much
of it is based on second-hand and third-hand assertions. There also
is scant evidence direct linking the government agencies to the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paucity of evidence, the jury accepted Pepper's
theory after Jowers's lawyer, Lewis Garrison, acknowledged his
client may have played a limited, indirect role in a conspiracy to
kill King.
</P>
<P>
   To some scholars, the evidence the jury used to reach its
verdict was too weak to require a rewriting of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the evidence was there of a conspiracy,'' said
Kenneth W. Goings, chairman of the history department at the
University of Memphis. ``It seems the King family, like many
Americans, just can't believe that one very insignificant
individual could create such havoc in their lives and the nation's,
so they keep looking for other forces that could have brought about
that kind of change. But it looks like they're wasting their
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet conspiracy theories for King's murder have long flourished,
and the verdict will likely do little to diminish them. As she sat
facing the balcony where King was killed, Jacqueline Smith, a
former resident of the motel, echoed the reactions of many
Americans to the jury's erdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not news to me,'' Smith said. ``It just confirms what
I've thought all along. He was the victim of a conspiracy.''

MASSACHUSETTS OK'S HANCOCK DEMUTUALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State regulators gave an expected nod Thursday to John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s plan to convert to a Wall
Street company, removing the last major hurdle facing the Boston
insurer as it prepares to issue first-time stock to the investing
public next month.
</P>
<P>
   The approval by the Massachusetts Division of Insurance came as
the agency roundly rejected strident criticisms from a small group
of consumer advocates and policyholders upset about Hancock's
highly-complex plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-page decision signed by insurance commissioner Linda
Ruthardt, the agency said it was ``not persuaded'' by complaints
that the nation's 13th-largest life insurer had misled customers
about various aspects of its conversion from a mutual firm owned by
policyholders to a stoccpany owned by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is positive news for our policyholders, and we are
encouraged by Commissioner Ruthardt's decision,'' said Stephen L.
Brown, Hancock's chairman and chief executive, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The division also said Hancock's highly-publicized inability to
find 400,000 missing policyholders had not raised red flags that
negatively affected the agency's consideration of Hancock's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we stress the importance of Hancock's continuing efforts
to locate policyholders, we find that. . . the absence of votes
from the still-missing policyholders does notrender the
(conversion) notice and policyholder vote unreasonable or so
prejudicial to policyholders or the insuring public as to compel
disapproval of the Plan,'' the decision said.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has 3.3 million policyholders, of which 2.9 million are
eligible for cash, stock, or beefier policies in the new company.
About 94 percent of 1.1 million policyholders voted in favor of the
conversion last month, giving Hancock the internal approval it
needs to issue over $2 billion in stock on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   While Hancock plans to allow AWOL customers to come forward and
claim compensation up to seven years after the stock offering,
critics argue that the missing should be given the right to vote
belatedly. The division said Hancock had not sent bills to missing
policyholders or contacted them through agents since 1985, when it
stopped requiring premiums for the small policies, known as
industrials, owned by such customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock initially lost track of 800,000 customers, or one
quarter of its total customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Rebutting criticisms raised at a division-sponsored publicearing
last month on Hancock's conversion, the agency also said Ruthardt
was not required ``to determine that the plan is in the best
interests of each and every policyholder, a standard that would be
impossible to attain.'' It rejected arguments by Boston lawyer
Jason Adkins that the division did not give critics or
policyholders enough time to assess the conversion's merits.
</P>
<P>
   And the division said Hancock's complex formula allocating
compensation to policyholders based on their past and future
profitability was fair. The agency noted that it approved a similar
formula for Worcester-based State Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
America when it converted to Allmerica Financial Corp. in 1995.
Critics argue the formula shortchanges policyholders because they
become less profitable to an insurer the longer they own policies.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts regulators also rejected complaints that Hancock
was cheating policyholders by not allowing them subscription rights
in the initial public offering, andsaid such a plan would be too
complex and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual in the insurance industry, Hancock has made cash the
automatic compensation unless policyholders specifically choose
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The division said the move to cash out smaller policyholders was
practical, since the administrative cost of servicing millions of
small shareholders, at $15 per person, was too high. ``In light of
Hancock's expected earnings of $2 per share, Hancock and its
financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, concluded that the expenditure
of nearly half that amount in shareholder servicing costs would be
excessive,'' the division wrote. Hancock said the figure was based
on projectionbut declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock had not intentionally reduced its life insurance
business or violated state laws, the division wrote _ even though
the number of individual life policies Hancock wrote from 1989 to
1997 declined 33 percent, compared with 22 percent for other
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock plans to create a ``closed block'' protecting
policyholder dividends in its new company, to be known as John
Hancock Financial Services Inc. The division will monitor the block
and require annual reports on its status for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Under its plan, Hancock must remain headquartered in
Massachusetts and keep the majority of its employees in-state for
at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   New York regulators, who are upset about New York insurer Mutual
of America's complaints that Hancock has reneged on reinsurance
contracts, must still give their blessings to Hancock's conversion.
``We expect they will do this,'' said a Hancock spokesman, Stephen
Burgay.

THE MAGIC OF OPENING NIGHT ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Matthew Broderick canceled at the last minute and
Katie Couric didn't show. There was only one camera crew, and
several audience members failed to come in black tie. But there was
electricity in the air nonetheless as limousines pulled up and
people crowded the sidewalk under the marquee for opening night of
``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening night on Broadway isn't what it used to be. The critics
no longer come all at once to that first official performance,
running up the aisles as the curtain falls to rush back to their
typewriters and tap out reviews for tomorrow's papers. (Now the
critics spread themselves out over the last few previews to write
their notices under less time pressure.)
</P>
<P>
   Television pays hardly any attention to opening night anymore.
Where once the invitations were engraved by Tiffany's and everyone
came in black tie, the evenings have grown more casual, with few
calling for formal attire. While the parties afterward, if they
happened at all, used to be intimate affairs at restaurants like
Sardi's _ where the cast members made grand entrances and were
greeted with applause _ now the events are large, costly, heavily
produced extravaganzas that are considered a pro forma perk for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   These developments may have taken some of the urgency and
elegance out of opening night, but some people in the theater
business say the experience is as magical as it always was.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there's no finer evening,'' said Aubrey Reuben, who
takes photographs for Playbill magazine and has practically not
missed an opening night in 20 years. ``I go every night with
anticipation and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The elements of opening night include everything from planning
the party to deciding which VIP trumps which VIP for a prime
orchestra seat on the aisle and sending gifts to the cast and crew.
There is also the Gypsy Robe ceremony before the show, a 50-year
tradition under which the chorus member who has appeared on
Broadway the most puts on a good-luck cape that has been passed
from one Broadway production (flops as well as hits) to another.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at one Broadway opening offers a window into the
hectic, happy, sometimes heartbreaking rituals leading up to and
through a show's biggest night. More than any other period in a
production's life, opening night signifies that rare, fleeting
moment of promise, celebration and good will. In just a short time
the sun will rise, bringing with it reviews, and reality will
descend. But for the next few glittering hours, at least, anything
is possible.
</P>
<P>
   THE PUBLICISTS
</P>
<P>
   It is noon on the biting November day before the revival of Cole
Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' is to open at the Martin Beck Theater on
West 45th Street. Chris Boneau and Amy Jacobs of the theatrical
publicity firm Boneau/Bryan-Brown are standing outside with Elie
Landau, the associate company manager of ``Kate,'' talking about
traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to stay on the street,'' Boneau explains. ``We
want them to keep moving.''
</P>
<P>
   They decide to angle the police stanchions in an attempt to
direct people into the theater and discourage them from socializing
on the sidewalk. They do this knowing it's largely futile; people
come to opening night to socialize on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Boneau, who started his company 10 years ago, plans to have as
many as 15 people from his office present during arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, Boneau says, when he would have to flip from channel
to channel to catch all the reviews on the 11 o'clock news. Now if
Hollywood pays a visit to Broadway _ as Woody Harrelson did this
season in ``The Rainmaker,'' and Kevin Spacey did in ``The Iceman
Cometh'' _ the cameras show up. Otherwise, they tend to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the office, Boneau and Ms. Jacobs get down to the
sensitive business of seating the celebrities, theater executives
and journalists they have invited.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Jacobs start out by considering ``who needs an
aisle.'' These, they decide, include Isabelle Stevenson, chairman
of the board of the American Theater Wing; Jed Bernstein, president
of the League of American Theaters and Producers (who always wears
his opening night bow tie for good luck); Al Hirschfeld, the
theater caricaturist, and John McDaniel, the musical director for
Rosie O'Donnell, whose talk show has become an important
promotional tool for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs, who was featured in ``Rent'' and has since had a
successful film career with ``Go'' and ``How Stella Got Her Groove
Back,'' is expected to attend. ``He's a movie star,'' Boneau says.
``We should really take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boneau and Ms. Jacobs talk about who will be ``happy to sit
upstairs,'' meaning in the mezzanine. ``Jules Feiffer can go
upstairs,'' Boneau says of the cartoonist. ``I hope he doesn't
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're actually very good seats,'' Boneau explains. ``It's
just that stigma of saying, `I'm going upstairs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among those for whom the publicists make sure to find seats in
the orchestra are the actors Tony Roberts and Laura Linney and the
writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Stockard Channing bumps the
director Stanley Donen (``Singin' in the Rain''). Three or four
pairs of seats are always reserved for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRE-SHOW
</P>
<P>
   It is about 4:30 p.m., nearly two hours before show time. Even
though the critics no longer need an early curtain, the tradition
of a 6:30 start has remained. Inside the theater the cast members
have gathered in the orchestra seats to warm up their voices with
the musical director, Paul Gemignani, a k a Paulie. Gemignani sits
on the edge of the orchestra pit in a plaid shirt and jeans, taking
them through the opening number, ``Another Op'nin' Another Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast then presents its group gifts to the director, Michael
Blakemore (a Mont Blanc pen); the choreographer, Kathleen Marshall
(Tiffany earrings), and Paulie (tequila).
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you need to do this for?'' Gemignani asks. ``You have
the job already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' answers one chorus member, ``but we want the next
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Berlind, the producer, who had wanted to do ``Kate'' since
the 1980s, hasn't arrived at the theater yet, so his partner, Roger
Horchow, says a few words, concluding with, ``Break a leg.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Berlind _ some have taken to calling them ``the Rogers''
_ put up and raised the $6.5 million it took to produce the show.
``I hope it will recoup,'' Horchow says with his typical Texas
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   After a group picture, the cast gathers in a circle onstage to
hear Terry Marone, guardian of the Gypsy Robe, talk about the
history of the ritual, how it started nearly 50 years ago when a
chorus member in ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' sent a good-luck
dressing gown to a friend in ``Call Me Madam,'' who added a cabbage
rose from Ethel Merman's costume and sent the robe to a friend
opening in ``Guys and Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marone announces the ``Kate'' winner, JoAnn M. Hunter, to
whoops of congratulations. Ms. Hunter puts on the robe and runs
three times around the circle, touching all the cast members as
they in turn offer her kisses, cheers and applause. She then visits
every dressing room, in keeping with tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In these dressing rooms the transformation from present-day
actors to 1940s hoofers begins. Amy Spanger, who plays Lois Lane
and gets to sing such classics as ``Always True to You (in My
Fashion),'' has been on Broadway before but in shows that were
already up and running: ``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``Fosse.'' This is
her first opening night. ``It's like the calm before the storm; all
week we've been on eggshells,'' Ms. Spanger says.
</P>
<P>
   In his dressing room next door, Michael Berresse, who plays Lois
Lane's gymnastic beau, Bill Calhoun, is trying to finish the cards
meant to accompany his opening-night gifts to the rest of the cast.
``I am so freaked out,'' Berresse says. ``No matter how prepared
you are, it's always more love than you can handle. Everyone wants
this thing to land.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the audience is starting to arrive. The square of
bright light under the marquee quickly becomes a crush of fur
collars and strong perfume. Berlind and Horchow stand side by side
near the doors, greeting family members, friends and fellow
producers. (``I've heard wonderful things,'' says Miles Wilkin of
SFX Theatrical.)
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Morison, the original Kate, arrives wearing black,
radiating an ethereal elegance. ``I'm a little nervous,'' she says.
``I know how they're feeling. I so want it to be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people arrive, Ms. Morison lingers outside among them,
greeting other members of the original cast, making herself
available for interviews. (``Make sure they spell Morison with one
R,'' she says to Boneau.)
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot arrives, a guest of Horchow. Fran Weissler, the
Broadway producer, shows up with Tommy Tune towering over her. Tune
says that without the critics in the audience anymore, ``opening
nights are like Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PARTY
</P>
<P>
   The coat check is on the left. Suzanne Tobak, Broadway's busiest
party planner, is on the right, coordinating the three-ring circus
that is an opening night party at Tavern on the Green. `` ``How's
seating?'' she asks into her headset.
</P>
<P>
   All this took military-style planning, from the chocolate kisses
decorating the tables (it is ``Kiss Me, Kate'') to the banners with
appropriate song titles hanging around the room (``Wunderbar''
behind the bar, ``Too Darn Hot'' over the dance floor) to the
Shakespeare glossary on fake parchment headed ``Brush Up Your
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Annie Get Your Gun'' last season, Tavern on the Green
became what Ms. Tobak called a ``Western blowout,'' with a haystack
outside, a country-western band, an archery range, stagecoaches and
toy guns, in addition to the chicken-and-ribs cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the party for ``Epic Proportions,'' the comedy
about shooting a ``Ten Commandments''-style movie in the 1930s, was
at the Copacabana and featured a live Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes shows have party favors but there are some shows, Ms.
Tobak says, for which such efforts would seem inappropriate. ``I
wouldn't theme into `Death of a Salesman,''' she explains. ``Nor
did I last year. We simply did an elegant evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Tobak declines to discuss the cost of an opening
night party, some producers put the range at $50,000 to $100,000.
Ms. Tobak will say she never pays full price for a party; through
bartering and sponsorship, she gets a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Iceman Cometh'' last season, Ms. Tobak enlisted Vox
vodka as a sponsor and used their bottles as centerpieces and had
special vodka bars.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext at these parties is the reviews _ particularly the
one in The New York Times. Now that the newspaper is printed in New
Jersey and Queens, publicists say, they miss the thrill of walking
to the Times building on West 43rd Street to get the review hot off
the presses and take it back to the party.
</P>
<P>
   But theater insiders generally say not getting the reviews at
the party makes a better party. ``If the reviews were bad, your
emotions went through the biggest drop you can imagine, right down
into a ditch,'' said James Freydberg, a Broadway producer. Even if
those in the know tried to keep their bad news to themselves, the
feeling seeped out and killed the spirit. These theater veterans
say the cast and crew deserve at least one night of pure joy, no
matter what they may be in for the next morning. As a result, some
producers have insisted that the reviews do not come near the
party.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' however, Boneau gets the Times review
off the Internet at close to 11 p.m. and brings it to the party. He
and Ms. Jacobs then excitedly run through the mirrored corridors of
Tavern on the Green, searching out the Rogers. When they find the
producers, they pull them into a quiet place: the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Boneau does not read the review or reveal that he has it folded
in his breast pocket; he just gives the producers what he knows
they want to hear, that the Times' chief theater critic, Ben
Brantley, generally loved the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've been to one of these,''
Boneau says, ``when it was all about pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MARKETING PLAN
</P>
<P>
   It is 10:30 on the morning after opening night, and the
marketing machine that has grown increasingly sophisticated on
Broadway is in full swing for ``Kiss Me, Kate.'' Coffee, Danish and
fruit are served in the conference room at the offices of Serino
Coyne, the theater ad agency. Boneau, Ms. Jacobs and Polk of
Boneau/Bryan-Brown have taken their seats at the table, along with
several members of the marketing and management teams and, of
course, the Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is remarkably restrained, given that each person at the
table is sitting in front of a thick stack of rave reviews from
newspapers all over the region, and that everyone present has been
through the opposite experience, when they strained to cull a
positive quotation from a sea of pans.
</P>
<P>
   They do have champagne, which is unusual for an ad meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After writing a radio ad, which immediately goes on the air, the
group discusses which of the gushy lines to lift for the huge
advertisement to appear in the next week's Arts &AMP; Leisure section
of The New York Times, among them: ``Enter musical comedy
paradise'' (Dennis Cunningham, CBS-TV). ``A knockout'' (The
Star-Ledger of Newark).
</P>
<P>
   They also debate whether to go for broke, running three
consecutive full pages instead of two. Wendy Orshan, the show's
general manager, argues against this extravagance, recalling how
theater people felt when Garth Drabinsky, of the now-defunct
Livent, used ostentatious ads for ``Ragtime.'' ``When Garth did
that, didn't we all say, `Who does he think he is?''' Ms. Orshan
says.
</P>
<P>
   The group gathers for a photo in front of the ad they've
designed, now printed out and pinned to the wall. They have just
become part of Broadway history: a hit show that is likely to keep
all of them busy for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   They consider whether to put another block of tickets up for
sale, and everyone agrees it is better to wait. ``We should keep
this,'' Boneau says, ``the hottest ticket in town.''

 &HT;    A new look for Aida
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Goodbye, pesky pyramid; hello, epic romance. Next
stop: Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida,'' which left many of its initial mistakes in Atlanta
(including that famously malfunctioning chunk of Egypto-junk) is so
improved that it's a good 80 percent ready for the Great White Way.
The pop musical opened Thursday night at the grandly restored
Cadillac Palace _ itself celebrating a debut _ and performances in
New York are to begin in February.
</P>
<P>
   In making wholesale changes, the Disney producers were shrewd
enough not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The elements
of ``Aida'' that were so impressive, drawing record crowds to
Atlanta's Alliance Theatre in fall 1998 _ the energizing score by
Elton John and Tim Rice (``The Lion King''), leading ladies Heather
Headley and Sherie Rene Scott _ are still in place and better than
ever. They're enhanced by more sophisticated dialogue (David Henry
Hwang of ``M. Butterfly'' fame) and sets (Bob Crowley,
``Carousel''), and dynamic direction and co-authorship by Chicago's
own Robert Falls, arguably the hottest stage director in America
(``Death of a Salesman'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida'' is big, slick and glitzy, yes, but beneath its shiny
pop plating there now thumps a real heart.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the company, Michael Eisner _ the Disney chairman
who takes a hands-on role in the company's stage work _ agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael saw the show the other night and was very
enthusiastic, which he was not in Atlanta,'' said Rice, sipping a
Diet Coke at the intermission of a recent preview. ``It's a whole
new show, really _ very exciting. I don't expect major changes
before New York.''
</P>
<P>
   True, there is a lingering air of weirdness and confusion at the
top of the show, prompting audience whispers such as, ``What's
going on?,'' ``Where is this taking place?'' (ancient Egypt, but
costumer Crowley throws in gypsies and Klingons, too) and, ``Why is
the Pharaoh wearing a giant ice bucket on his head?'' Falls'
inexperience at handling a singing-dancing chorus, or staging
musicals at all, is most glaring in the first 20 minutes. But then
his showmanship takes hold and the timeless tale of a doomed love
triangle comes into focus and builds in intensity to the final
chord.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bernhardt, the Alliance board chairman who saw a recent
preview with a contingent of Atlantans, was delighted by the
revamped ``Aida.'' He also was delighted by the line on the
program's title page that credits the Alliance for presenting the
1998 premiere (the credit was harder to find for the Alliance's
Broadway 1997 transfer of ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrific shot for the artistic reputation of the
Alliance _ and a financial shot as well,'' Bernhardt said. The
Alliance's royalties are
</P>
<P>
   (salinity) Please see AIDA, F3
</P>
<P>
   expected to be $5,000 to $10,000 a week for the two-month
Chicago engagement, with a comparable revenue flow for the Broadway
run. Though it's a fraction of Disney's share (including exclusive
movie rights), the Alliance royalties are an important windfall for
a nonprofit theater with an accumulated deficit of $1 million. The
Alliance took national criticism for what was seen as an
all-too-commercial partnership with the Mouse, but artistic
director Kenny Leon says the royalties will subsidize his more
adventurous, meaty fare that is not always supported at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida'' (shortened from its Alliance title, ``Elaborate Lives:
The Legend of Aida'') is based on the myth that inspired the 1871
Verdi opera: the forbidden love of a Nubian princess, Aida
(Headley), and the Egyptian commander Radames (Adam Pascal), who
vanquished her people and is already betrothed to an Egyptian
princess, Amneris (Scott). Those who come listening for for Verdi's
grave splendor will be disappointed. Then again, opera purists are
not the target audience here. In Disney's take, sexpot Amneris
(Scott) is cheekily saluted by a slave as, ``First in beauty,
wisdom and accessories.'' She mocks her own fashion mania and
I-enjoy-being-a-girl narcissism in ``My Strongest Suit,'' which
sounds like Elton's affectionate sendup of sock-hop songs, a la
``Crocodile Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is aiming for the elusive 18-to-35 market, reawakened by
1996's ``Rent'' to the allegedly mummified art form of musical
theater. The casting of Scott and Pascal (vastly more dynamic than
his Atlanta predecessor, Hank Stratton), who were both in ``Rent,''
is probably not coincidental. Even the dagger-shaped marquee of the
Cadillac Palace (the car sponsorship makes it sound like a Texas
dance hall, but it's actually a magnificent 1900s theater) has the
look of a hip nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish-born Crowley, the reigning genius of designers (even
his sets for the failed ``Capeman'' were astounding) is a key to
``Aida's'' new cool quotient. He specializes in elegant visual
tricks from the subconscious, but on an Imax scale. He shows us an
overhead view of a swimming pool with swimmers zooming through
space; a huge hieroglyphic eye whose pupil can be a blazing sun; a
line of silhouetted palm trees, growing out of their own reflected
image in a shimmering Nile, used in the magazine ads for the
Broadway production (interestingly, those ads mention Disney in the
tiniest print, presumably so that theatergoers in their 20s won't
be scared away by visions of dancing animals).
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Disney wildlife, Headley's New York debut was as
Nala in ``The Lion King,'' but it's as Aida that she displays a
true lioness spirit. If this musical can ever be said to match
Verdi for operatic grandeur, it's when her Aida _ serving as
Amneris' slave but planning to lead a prisoners' revolt _ stands in
the spotlight and sings furiously to the gods about her conflicted
passion and duty. Safe prediction: Headley will be a star.
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to Pascal, who does a fine job on his end of
the romantic duets (including ``Written in the Stars,'' sung by
Elton and LeAnn Rimes in the breakout single from the
all-star``Aida'' CD), Headley's verses are the evening's high
points.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more moving duet, the lovers sing of their
``Elaborate lives ... extravagant times,'' and their aching search
through war for ``a little peace and truth.'' It's a striking
linkage between antiquity and our own danger-filled, millennial
moment. Rice said, ``Yes, I wanted a modern resonance, a relevance,
if that doesn't sound too pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man who sometimes seemed a mere glib assistant to Andrew
Lloyd Webber, Rice now brings a maturity, even a touch of poetic
depth to his lyrics, matched by Elton's more soulful sound. These
qualities were partially drowned out in Atlanta by the pyramid
buzzing, flimsy character development and other problems, but are
now allowed to sing.

COMMENTARY: THE BOOK ON GEORGE W. 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his first presidential debate, George W. Bush volunteered
that he was reading a book about postwar international policy. It
is possibly a bad sign that we now feel compelled to examine what
he meant by ``read.''
</P>
<P>
   Our leading Republican candidate has been plagued by speculation
that he's not all that deep a thinker. ``I read books all the
time,'' he told the debate audience in New Hampshire, a tad
defensively. ``I'm reading a book on Dean Acheson right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the book in question was ``Acheson: the Secretary of
State Who Created the American World,'' by James Chace. Weighing in
at 512 pages, it describes Acheson's work overseeing the
establishment of NATO and the World Bank, and the financing of the
Marshall plan.
</P>
<P>
   How many people out there think that Bush:
</P>
<P>
   A) really read the book
</P>
<P>
   B) really read some of the book
</P>
<P>
   C) was really briefed by an adviser who is reading the book
</P>
<P>
   D) purchased the book and was carrying it around in his suitcase
at the time of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to be hyper-critical. Many of us believe that, for
the purposes of dinner party conversation, paying for a book and
hauling it from one hotel room to the next counts as reading it.
Now that I have skimmed two reviews of ``Acheson'' and talked to
the author on the phone for 10 minutes, I feel qualified to assure
you it is one really fine piece of work, and to discuss it at
social events with great authority.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bar gets raised a bit when a presidential candidate
goes on TV and claims to have an impressive-sounding tome on his
night table in order to demonstrate he's not a superficial,
underprepared, overentitled Quayle clone. I think I speak for all
of us in saying that under those circumstances, the alleged reader
should at least prepare a few pithy comments demonstrating that he
knows what the book was about.
</P>
<P>
   A few days and another debate later, Bush was asked, rather
cruelly, what lessons he had learned from his study of the Acheson
era. The flummoxed governor started out with a caution that the
United States should not ``retreat within our borders.'' He put in
a good word for free trade, quoted a speech he gave at the Citadel,
and concluded this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The lessons of Acheson and Marshall are _ is that our nation's
greatest export to the world has been, is, and always will be the
incredible freedoms we understand in the great land called
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush said it was hard to give a full book review ``in a
minute's time,'' but more time was the last thing he appeared to
need. In fact, he looked like a ninth grader had who forgotten to
do his homework, desperately free-associating and hoping the bell
would ring.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush was telling the truth about the Acheson book, he is
apparently capable of reading 512 pages of material and coming away
from the exercise without a single new thought. Even if he's only
made his way through the first few chapters, he should have been
able to answer the debate question by saying he had learned that a
man can become a successful public servant after being a C student
at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   If he was fibbing, the problem is even worse. An American
president meets dozens of heads of state every year, virtually all
of whom have written books, most of them unreadable. How would
President Bush, the Sequel, react when one of them fishes for a
compliment about a recent literary effort? We don't necessarily
need a great reader in the White House, but we do need somebody who
knows how to fake it under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never tried to pass himself off as an intellectual before.
When you've got charisma, who needs a Phi Beta Kappa key? But the
shock of the early debates has been how charmless he's appeared. If
Dan Quayle looked like a deer caught in the headlights when he was
in front of the cameras, Bush sometimes resembles a possum cornered
in the garage _ hunched over, tense, eyes darting worriedly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response, his campaign has been trying to upgrade his
image as a thinker. By recent accounts of the Bush team, over the
last few weeks he's devoured approximately 2,000 pages of
nonfiction, including a 774-page biography of John D. Rockefeller
and a 476-page work on Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Big books. Deep man.

 &HT;    After three decades family finally can say, `Free at last'
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coretta Scott King can finally exhale.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King said Thursday she is
relieved she can finally move on now that a Memphis, Tenn., jury
has agreed that her husband's death was part of a wide-ranging
conspiracy, not the act of lone gunman James Earl Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband once said, `The moral arch of the universe is long,
but it bends towards justice,''' Mrs. King said at the news
conference at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after a month of testimony, the civil trial jury
in Memphis unanimously concluded that former cafe owner Loyd Jowers
had conspired with elements of the Memphis Police Department, the
federal government and organized crime to kill King on April 4,
1968. The jury awarded the family the symbolic $100 in damages it
had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Scott King said his family endured ridicule and hardships
to get to this point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``While my heart is heavy,'' he said, ``this is sweet, because
we finally know what happened. Sweet because this family has been
vindicated. Sweet because we can say, 'Free at last.'''
</P>
<P>
   A 1978 congressional probe concluded that Ray was the likely
shooter, though he was probably part of a small-scale conspiracy
involving two St. Louis racists. Last year, the Justice Department
opened a limited probe into Jowers' allegations and into assertions
by a former FBI agent that he found papers in Ray's abandoned car
that would indicate a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, U.S. Rep. John Lewis (R-Ga.) called for a
full-blown federal investigation into the assassination. A top aide
to King as the president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, Lewis said he always believed in a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the truth out about what happened to Martin
Luther King Jr.,'' Lewis said. ``Finding the truth will set our
nation free.''
</P>
<P>
   Jowers had told a nationwide TV audience in 1993 that a Memphis
produce dealer with alleged mob ties had paid him $100,000 to hire
a hit man. The King family has said they believe Jowers' assertion
that the assassin was a now-deceased Memphis police officer known
for his sharpshooting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday the current
probe is not likely to produce any criminal charges, despite the
Memphis jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that, given the verdict (Wednesday), this will renew
interest the King assassination, and I suspect plant in the minds
of many people doubts about some of those conclusions that were
reached earlier,'' said Holder.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings say they're no longer concerned with what others may
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what the Justice Department says,'' Dexter King
said. ``I doubt seriously they will indict themselves. We did not
do this to force their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, family members hugged each other as
they walked to place roses on King's crypt.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter King helped his mother across a small footbridge to the
island crypt where his father lays.
</P>
<P>
   In front of it, Mrs. King closed her eyes, placed down the rose
and exhaled.

 &HT;    Book list for youngsters chock-full of old favorites
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another Y2K-themed ``best of'' booklist is making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic Books has released ``200 for 2000: Literature for the
Millennium,'' a list of great books for younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to celebrate the millennium, and also get a
conversation going over how people felt about the old classics and
the new classics,'' said Francie Alexander, a vice president for
the New Jersey-based publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous lists for best books, movies and TV shows that
have created controversy, Scholastic didn't rank the books from top
to bottom. Instead, the list simply groups works by age
appropriateness and genre.
</P>
<P>
   Among the better known books for younger readers are
``Charlotte's Web,'' by E.B. White; ``Sylvester and the Magic
Pebble,'' by William Steig; ``The Snowy Day,'' by Ezra Jack Keats;
and ``Goodnight Moon,'' by Margaret Wise Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Theodore Geisel, aka Dr. Suess, makes the list not
for a single book but for his entire goofy-but-wonderful
</P>
<P>
   oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   For older readers the list includes ``Anne Frank: Diary of a
Young Girl,'' by Anne Frank; ``Stuart Little'' by E.B. White;
``Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,'' by Judy Blume; and ``The
Yearling,'' by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, the wildly popular Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling
made the list, too.

   Alexander said the project started in May when company editors
introduced a 100-book list during a conference, and then posted it
on the company's Web site.

   ``All of a sudden we had hundreds of responses asking, `How
could you leave out such and such?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander gathered a panel of five independent librarians to
sort through the reponses and to make suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while we realized we couldn't get it down to a
hundred,'' Alexander said. ``We had a hard time narrowing it down
to 200, and there were still hundreds more that didn't make the
cut.''

<P>
   THE LEADS
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta: Heather Headley as Aida and Sherie Rene Scott as
Amneris were excellent; Hank Stratton as Radames was as plastic as
a Ken doll.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago: Headley and Scott are better than ever. Adam Pascal
(Roger in ``Rent''), the dynamic new Radames, strikes romantic
sparks with Headley.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOOK
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta: Ancient Egypt goofily crossed with ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago:Sets by Tony Award winner Bob Crowley (``Carousel'')
have dreamlike elegance on an Imax scale.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOOK
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   Linda Woolverton's dialogue sounded like it was geared toward
teens, and not even smart ones.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   Co-writers David Henry Hwang and Robert Falls (also director)
add a whole new flashback narrative frame, even some wit and
character depth.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice's score was already first-rate.
Flavorings of gospel and soul linked vanquished Nubians to today's
African-Ameri-cans; victorious Egyptians were party-rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   A new song, ``Not Me,'' adds little, but the score is better
showcased by the overall production.
</P>
<P>
   THE SET
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid refused to glide, spin or unfold; it buzzed at the worst
possible moments during the romantic duets.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   No pyramid, but a levitating tomb falls 15 feet, slightly
injuring Headley and Pascal during an early preview. Latest tomb
stays a nice safe 4 feet off the floor.

 &HT;    Alabama town decks itself out in memory of Victorian era
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPELIKA, Ala. _ Jan Jones is sneaky.
</P>
<P>
   One night, several Christmases ago, the local artist secretly
placed life-size Santas and angels, carousel horses and teddy bears
on the porches of more than 30 Victorian homes in her historic
North Opelika neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Word got out and people from around the area flocked to admire
her elaborately dressed figures.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, more than 10,000 visitors are expected in this
east Alabama town for Victorian Front Porch Christmas, which runs
Thursday through Sunday. Carolers, musicians and neighbors in
Victorian attire add to the fun. For the first time, three
storytellers will be positioned on various porches to tell about
the history of the houses and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costumes and figures are breathtaking,'' says resident
Nita Guthrie. ``Everyone has such fun and it brings the community
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The free tour is open to automobiles and walkers from 6-9 p.m.
Dec. 9-12. From 6-9 p.m. Saturday, the streets are closed to cars
so carolers, neighbors and visitors can experience the spectacle on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The walking tour begins at North Eighth Street and Second Avenue
at the Heritage House, a bed-and-breakfast. Folks can stroll up to
Seventh Avenue, then come back down Eighth Street to Fifth Avenue
and turn right and go to North Ninth Street. Then, they can take a
left onto Third Avenue and walk back up Ninth Street.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Victorian Front Porch Christmas event,
Opelika offers plenty of Southern hospitality via its inviting
antiques stores and gift shops,
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of a princely Croak-A-Lika Frog.
</P>
<P>
   In the heyday of trains, Opelika was a transportation hub and
had many railroad tracks. The section of track that crossed was
held together by metal frogs _ devices for keeping train cars on
the right rails at intersections. Artistic license has been taken
with the word frog by the Christmas artist Jones, who makes amusing
papier-mache frog collectibles and dresses them in a variety of
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, trains chug through Opelika on historic Railroad
Avenue, which is home to a variety of shops in refurbished
buildings. It's also the perfect place to park your car and stroll
the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some engineers blow their horns all the way through town,''
said Joanne Woodall of Southern Crossing, a gift shop on Railroad
Avenue. ``Others just give a short beep. But after awhile, you
don't pay any attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall and five other women have owned the shop, a former
hardware store, for four years. Each does her own buying, and the
mix includes everything from the frogs and painted furniture to
jewelry and antiques. ``For six women, we all get along and have a
good time,'' Woodall said with a laugh. ``When we have a difference
of opinion, we vote and whatever the consensus, that's what goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor on this historic avenue is the two-story shop
the Gallery. Built in 1865, the building was originally a saloon
but for the past 20 years has housed frames, prints, European
garden ornaments, accessories and gifts. Owner Deborah Purves said
there's ``a whole new beat going on'' in downtown Opelika. ``Thank
goodness, people are revitalizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the tracks, but still on the avenue, is High Cotton, an
eclectic gift shop located in an old cotton warehouse. Items range
from Vera Bradley's patterned soft luggage to Vietri Italian
pottery and Mississippi artist Vicki Carroll's hand-painted china.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, two friends from Baton Rouge, La., Sally
Pareti and Debbie Sikes, were shopping for Christmas gifts, and,
for themselves. The two had stopped on their way to Atlanta to
visit relatives. ``There's a charm about Opelika,'' said Pareti,
who was looking for something ``I can't find at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Opelika derives its name from the Creek Indian words Opila for
swamp and laka for large or big, thus meaning Big Swamp. Since
Opelika is actually the highest elevation between Atlanta to New
Orleans, why the name Big Swamp? Historians say the streams and
creeks throughout the area that were being fed by the lakes caused
the Indians to choose swamp as a descriptive term.
</P>
<P>
   Like many smaller towns, downtown Opelika, incorporated in 1854,
has had its retail ups and downs. ``In the early '70s, streets were
closed off and monstrous steel awnings were put on storefronts,''
said Sherri Sumners, president of the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacancies were running 40 percent. It was a ghost town. The
city fathers saw that something had to be done. They refurbished
the train station, which now houses the arts association,
demolished some buildings to build a park and took down those
awnings. Between 1989 and 1999, $22 million in capital investment,
both public and private, was pumped into Opelika.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there's 5 percent vacancy in the area and the town of
28,000 is working to build loft apartments in the century-old
buildings _ to attract people to live downtown.
</P>
<P>
   One shop that's been a constant in town in Winston Smith T
Hardware on Railroad Avenue. For more than 60 years, this store,
which is in a turn-of-the-century building, has been selling
everything from building supplies and mail boxes to tools. ``I have
an old invoice book from '44, which lists transactions,'' said
Dozier Smith T, grandson of the original owner Winston. ``Now I
have the sons and daughters of those customers as my customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what separates our store from the other boys. We
know each customer by name.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Take I-85 south to Exit 62. Follow U.S. 280 (toward Birmingham)
into town. It's about 100 miles from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hours
</P>
<P>
   From 6-9 Friday night, retailers on Railroad Avenue will treat
shoppers to holiday treats, hot wassail and live music. Kids can
ride a miniature train and meet Santa and Mrs. Claus. Typically,
most shops are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays; however, some
close early on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
</P>

 &HT;    McTeer hones maternal instincts once again for `Tumbleweeds'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, British actress Janet McTeer riveted Broadway
audiences and won the Tony Award for best actress in ``A Doll's
House,'' playing a conventional 19th-century mother gathering the
strength to leave her stuffy marriage. Now she's turning heads at
the multiplex with her electric performance in ``Tumbleweeds,''
playing another kind of mom, a Southern hellion who drags her
preteen daughter cross-country in search of a new life.
</P>
<P>
   The two projects are connected. ``Tumbleweeds'' co-writer and
director Gavin O'Connor first saw McTeer on ``The Charlie Rose
Show'' during the Broadway run, and saw in her the movie's rowdy
Mary Jo, based loosely on his then-wife's mother. ``I have no idea
how he saw Mary Jo in me,'' McTeer says from her London home,
brewing an afternoon cup of tea. ``I think it has to do with being
uncompromising. I had very short black hair at the time, and I
certainly wasn't looking girly.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge of shooting ``Tumbleweeds'' was playing most of
her scenes opposite 13-year-old Kimberly Brown, co-starring as Mary
Jo's daughter. ``We just sort of clicked and became great
friends,'' McTeer says of the process, which required the two to
improvise some scenes as they filmed. ``We were very keen not to
treat her as a kid. She and I were the two leading actresses, so we
discussed everything. We questioned her and challenged her. It
wasn't about my leading and having her follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge of the shoot: nailing a Southern accent. She
took a couple of lessons with a voice coach. ``We could only afford
about two, because we didn't have much money,'' McTeer says. She
watched movies like ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' visited North
Carolina and tried out her accent on taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer recently returned to North Carolina on business, shooting
the period film ``Songcatcher.'' But her accent work didn't help:
In that movie, opening next year, she had to perfect a
turn-of-the-century Boston accent. Now, having shot four movies in
the past 18 months, she's glad to take a break in London for the
holidays. But New Line, the distributor of ``Tumbleweeds,'' is
keeping her in the spotlight, lobbying for year-end award
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it very much,'' she says of the attention. ``It's
very odd. Some of the people I've met have been very nice. But
sometimes it's a little bit daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not sure I'm particularly interesting enough to write
about.''

 &HT;    Rage cranks sonic assault to critical praise
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first acts to really make something out of the
rap-rock template, Rage Against the Machine might be the most
influential band in business right now. For better or worse, the
Los Angeles group perfected the testosterone-rich formula that
dominates late-'90s rock, where jagged, dissonant guitar heroics
meet hip-hop beats and phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the bands it's inspired, however, Rage Against
the Machine exploits the hybrid musical style with an ambitious
sense of scope, and an agenda that puts it in the grand American
tradition of social protest that links Woody Guthrie to Public
Enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, radical rockers who actually sound as earthshaking as
the MC5 were supposed to 30 years ago,'' writes critic Eric
Weisbard in the January issue of Spin, which named Rage its band of
the year and placed its latest album, ``The Battle of Los
Angeles,'' second in its Top 20 list of 1999 pop albums. Tracks
such as ``Calm Like a Bomb'' and ``Guerrilla Radio'' accurately
describe the band's concept, which feeds on the tension between
guitarist Tom Morello's innovative fretwork _ with its fusillades
of disorienting sonic effects _ and vocalist Zach de la Rocha's
passionate raps, which target everything from oppressive regimes in
Central America to police violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the best bands I've ever worked with,'' says
Brendan O'Brien, the Atlanta-based producer who directed Rage's
breakthrough 1996 album, ``Evil Empire'' as well as ``Battle.''
``And live, they're one of the best if not the best performing acts
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan and label mate Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls counts Rage
as one of her favorite acts. ``They're an incredible band, one of
the greatest,'' she says. ``I saw them at the Masquerade once, and
they were mind-blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's unabashedly leftist politics have prompted its
critics to take pokes: Rolling Stone magazine compared Rage's
lyrics to the hyperventilated dogma of a religious tract, and
references to ``pigs'' and ``devils'' can seem like a throwback to
'60s revolutionary lingo that may be lost on the kids roiling in
the mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   But Morello insists that the band's message is getting across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's difficult for folks outside of it to adjust to
the fact that 435,000 people could go out in one week and buy a
Rage record, and if they do get it, that's kind of threatening,''
Morello says. ``Our audience is an intelligent one. It's not that
our message is that well hidden, it's there in every song, on every
T-shirt, in every video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up being a fan of bands _ my first favorite band was
Kiss, and they were loathed by all reviewers,'' he continues.
``That set my barometer. We've made the album of our career. We've
got a sold-out arena tour of the U.S. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-educated Morello may be one of the most articulate
lead guitarists in contemporary rock, the child of activist
parents, who hails from an Illinois town with a perfectly Norman
Rockwell name: Libertyville. He traces his political awakening to
childhood. ``Growing up brown-skinned in a predominantly white
town, issues come up early and often on the playground,'' he says.
``I realized early on that the history I had learned at home was
very different than the one I learned at school, and when pressed,
the teachers weren't so sure about party lines.''

important, though complicated way. ``When we started, there was
white music or black music and you had to choose,'' says Morello.
``So Rage seemed destined for oblivion. The curse of having a
multiethnic band. At that time, if you had a black guy in your
band, there was no way you'd be taken seriously as a rock band, and
if you had a white guy you were never viable in the hip-hop
community. And a guy of Chicano descent? There's no room for that
in the spectrum.''

RED SOX SEEKING PITCHING AT WINTER MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As is his custom, Red Sox GM Dan Duquette is shedding
little light on the team's plans entering baseball's five-day
winter meetings, which open Friday in Anaheim. The word from his
office Thursday was that the GM was in, but not ``available.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Unlike White Sox GM Ron Schueler, who is
staying home and letting his lieutenants conduct his team's
business at the meetings, Duquette is planning to head up the Sox
delegation, which is expected to include top aides Eddie Haas and
Lee Thomas and big-league scout Frank Malzone, among others.
</P>
<P>
   This much is also as obvious as the new scar on Bret
Saberhagen's shoulder: The Sox come into the meetings in search of
more pitching to bolster a starting rotation looking rather thin in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The high-end help that could resolve the Sox shortage has little
appeal to Duquette, according to some of his earlier public
pronouncements. The Anaheim Angels, for example, elected to let
free-agent lefthander Chuck Finley walk this week rather than offer
him salary arbitration. Signing Finley, therefore, would not cost
the Sox any draft choices in compensation, but the asking price for
the 37-year-old Finley is expected to be at least $25 million for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   A ludicrous sum for a pitcher who has averaged just 12 wins in
the last three seasons? If you are among those answering in the
affirmative, you have company in Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks, who
wasn't speaking about Finley directly but complained this week that
some of his colleagues are spending like ``drunken sailors,''
citing the $12 million one-year deal the Yankees gave pitcher David
Cone this week. And Duquette has said that Finley is too rich for
his blood, and the same probably holds true for such free agents as
Aaron Sele, Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Even a free-agent righthander like Steve Trachsel, offered
arbitration by the Cubs this week, reportedly is seeking a
three-year deal in the neighborhood of $6 million to $7 million a
year. This, after going 8-18 with a 5.56 ERA last season, when he
won four of his last six decisions to avoid becoming a 20-game
loser.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent righthander Omar Olivares, a 15-game winner last year
in a season split between the Angels and A's, is an intrigiung
possibility, but his agent, Scott Boras, said the 32-year-old
Olivares wants a four- or five-year deal. The budget-conscious A's
offered Olivares arbitration, but probably did so only to ensure
they'll get something in return when someone else coughs up the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox could look at some cheaper free-agent alternatives, like
Bobby Witt or ex-Rangers rigfhthander Joihn Burkett, but neither
was effective last season. Witt was just 1-9 in the season's last
two months to finish 7-15, while Burkett, 35, was just 9-8 with a
5.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The pickings may be just as slim in the trade market. The Sox
have talked with the Dodgers about Ismael Valdes and Darren
Dreifort and have inquired about Padres lefthander Sterling
Hitchcock, but a deal with either club would require Duquette to
part with prospects he's disinclined to give up, including
shortstop Adam Everett and left-handed power hitter Dernell
Stenson.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have some pitching for whom they might be willing to
listen to offers, including righthanders Kirk Rueter and Shawn
Estes, the Yankees would consider parting with righthander Hideki
Irabu, a relative bargain at $2 million for next season, and the
Devil Rays are expected to field offers for righthander Rolando
Arrojo. But it's a seller's market, and Duquette may find few
takers for the players he'd be willing to move, including third
baseman John Valentin and second baseman Jeff Frye.
</P>
<P>
   There's little question that the Sox, who went through a
league-high 13 starting pitchers last season, will have new names
to audition come next spring. Whether Duquette lands any of those
pitchers this weekend remains to be seen, and the new acquisitions
may be just as nondescript as last winter's pickups, Mark Portugal
and Pat Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings may not produce a blockbuster to rival last month's
Shawn Green-Raul Mondesi deal between the Dodgers and Blue Jays,
nor a free-agent signing to rival that of first baseman John Olerud
by the Mariners earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those names will pale by comparison if the
Mariners succeed in dealing Ken Griffey Jr., with the Cincinnati
Reds still the team most likely to land Junior if a trade is
consummated.

   JERUSALEM _ The news that Israel is sitting down to peace talks
with Syria galvanized opposition and government forces alike
Thursday, with Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon mobilizing
resistance to the expected surrender of the Golan Heights and
center-left parties rallying behind Ehud Barak, their suddenly
ebullient prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a government that was born to make history,'' crowed
Yossi Sarid, head of the leftist Meretz faction, which was lately
devoting much of its energy to carping at Barak's economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Even the long-stagnant Tel Aviv stock market seemed giddy,
jumping 4 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister,
virtually all political leaders here were caught off guard by
President Clinton's announcement Wednesday that Barak and Syria's
foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, will begin talks in Washington
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday they scrambled to embrace or denounce the decision, as
commentators noted how the prospect of peace with Israeli's last
belligerent neighbor had instantly transformed the political
climate here.
</P>
<P>
   In a Tel Aviv meeting Thursday with members of his own Labor
Party, who in a gathering just a week ago had shouted bitter
complaints about his budget plans, Barak was greeted with sustained
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago as foreign minister I saw and sat one person
away from Farouk al-Sharaa at lunch given by the King of Spain, but
we couldn't speak with him,'' Barak told his party colleagues. ``It
was impossible to conduct a dialogue, and today we are able to
conduct a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, meanwhile, who had been frustrated in his efforts to
unite the right behind his own dispirited Likud party, greeted the
announcement as a gift: Here was a fundamental issue clearly
separating his allies from Barak's coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   In gatherings Thursday of Likud activists and other opposition
leaders, Sharon blasted the Barak plan as a capitulation both to
President Hafez Assad of Syria and President Clinton. ``American
internal interests don't have a thing to do with vital Israeli
interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, especially relishes the prospect of a national
referendum on any peace deal with Syria as an opportunity to undo
the last election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks are not dangerous,'' Sharon told a state radio
interviewer Thursday. ``What is dangerous is the content of the
talks, and the commitment of Prime Minister Barak to a full
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, despite the denials still being
issued by the prime minister's office.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory for Syria,'' Sharon said. He asserted
that officials in Damascus contend that Barak communicated a
willingness to withdraw to the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee,
Israel's border with Syria before their 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   David Levy, the foreign minister, disputed that assertion. ``We
will not go into an agreement that means the line of Galilee,
period,'' he said. ``I reiterate the government position that
everybody knows, that there is no return to the line of Galilee or
to June 4, 1967.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Syria peace talks disclosure also prompted an unusual public
commentary by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Paris, Netanyahu was quoted as saying that Assad
had secretly agreed to his demand for continued Israeli control of
Mount Hermon _ the peak of the Golan Heights _ but that talks had
foundered when Israel refused to withdraw back to pre-1967 borders.
Netanyahu had been largely silent on his own unsuccessful pursuit
of a Syrian peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, never lacking for confidence, claims he is succeeding
where his predecessor failed because he has delivered on promised
land-for-peace concessions to the Palestinians. ``I promised to
advance the negotiations with the Palestinians, and the
negotiations advanced,'' the prime minister said in an interview
published in Israel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golan Heights, Israeli residents held emergency meetings
Thursday to plan their response. Though Israeli peace advocates
envision accords under which Israel could retain water rights in
the area and full access for military surveillance purposes, almost
every scenario assumes the evacuation of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most residents of the Golan, and all the Golan leadership,
oppose leaving the Golan Heights,'' said Eli Malca, chairman of the
Golan Heights Settlements Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Barak often reminds his adversaries, he won 56 percent of
the Golan vote last May on a platform that made peace with Syria a
top priority. Yoav Tzur, who heads a pro-Barak ``Golan with Peace''
group, said Thursday that the prime minister received ``a clear
mandate from the public, including the Golan residents, to move
towards peace. With this mandate he is going forward, and
justifiably so.''
</P>
<P>
   But surveys show that even liberal Israelis are wary of a pact
with an aging Syrian dictator who has invaded their country twice
in their lifetime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a poll released Thursday by Tel Aviv University, but
conducted before Wednesday's announcement, a surprisingly strong 47
percent plurality of Israelis pronounced themselves ``greatly
opposed'' to a peace with Syria that required withdrawal from the
Golan Heights. Only 23 percent said they were either ``greatly'' or
``somewhat'' in favor of such a tradeoff. Yet just a small minority
of the same group of Israelis surveyed oppose plans for a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.

 &HT;    Cards, Bucs work their way back into contention
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cardinals and Buccaneers seemed dead more than a
month ago. Now, both teams are scratching their way back into the
NFL playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which had a 2-6 record on Nov. 7 and trailed Washington
by three games in the NFC East, can tie the first-place Redskins
with a victory at Washington on Sunday. The Cardinals have won four
games in a row _ their longest streak since 1988 _ and are 5-2
against teams in their division.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been sparked by the return of quarterback Jake
Plummer, who missed more than a month with a broken ring finger.
But the Cards' defense has been the difference. Arizona is allowing
only 17.3 points a game over the past four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense has carried this team,'' Cardinals wide receiver
Frank Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona will have to slow down the Redskins, who have the NFC's
No. 2 offense at 368.3 yards per game. Washington has scored 347
points in 12 games, second only to St. Louis' 400. The Cardinals
have scored 183 points this season, fewest in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope Washington wouldn't score a lot of points against
us,'' Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said. ``But they certainly have
the firepower to do that and have done it against almost everyone.
Regardless, we have to be more efficient offensively. We have to be
able to utilize our weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers, who have won five games in a row, haven't been
very efficient on offense, either. But first place in the NFC
Central is on the line when the Lions travel to Tampa Bay on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in crunch time,'' Bucs defensive lineman Brad Culpepper
said. ``We're in December. If you look at the past with (Bucs
coach) Tony (Dungy), we've always done pretty well in December. It
means the most. You hate to say one game means more than the next,
but the month of December is when championships are built. There's
no way there's a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers rookie Shaun King, who beat the Vikings in his first
NFL start last week, has won his past 15 games, including a perfect
12-0 season at Tulane last year. King's last loss came at
Mississippi on Nov. 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Divisional matchup: The Patriots will be fighting for their
playoff lives when they travel to Indianapolis. New England is
three games behind the Colts in the AFC East. A loss would all but
knock the Pats out of the postseason. ``It looks like we need to
win the rest of our games,'' New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: The Eagles stunned the Cowboys 13-10 on Oct. 10,
when Philadelphia quarterback Doug Pederson threw a 28-yard
touchdown to Charles Johnson with 1:07 left. Dallas has won its
past seven games at home, including all five this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: The Patriots have their backs against the
wall. Bledsoe has torched the Colts in the past, throwing for 15
touchdowns in his past six games vs. Indianapolis. Youth will catch
up with the Colts at some point, won't it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler had six
touchdown passes the past two weeks. He should have his way with
San Francisco's secondary, which has been a revolving door this
season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: New England cornerback Ty Law will cover
Colts receiver Marvin Harrison, who needs only five catches to
break Marshall Faulk's club record of 86 in a season.

UNFUNNY `DEUCE BIGALOW' MANAGES TO BE TASTELESS, MEAN-SPIRITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news is ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' which is an
insufferably insipid, cruelly subtexted comedy, is only 84 minutes
long.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is it's a long 84 minutes and makes us wonder why
studios continue to bankroll lame, inert efforts like this starring
ex-``Saturday Night Live'' cast members.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schneider, who co-wrote the film and stars as Deuce Bigalow,
worked for four seasons on the long-running show. While he may have
been a popular addition to late-night TV, it's hard to figure what
his appeal is in this one-note, mean-spirited movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a goofy, sweet-hearted fish tank cleaner, Deuce
Bigalow (Schneider), who winds up being a gigolo to the misfits of
Los Angeles after he meets Antoine Laconte (Oded Fehr), the top
escort to the golden, beautiful women in the City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine, who must go out of town on business, asks Deuce to
housesit his swank apartment and look after his ailing and rare
Chinese Tailbar Lionfish. There are only two things he demands:
don't answer his phone and don't drive his Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Deuce does both and discovers he can make a lot more
money as a gigolo than toiling away at the the local aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The film's core gag is all Deuce's dates have an affliction _
Tourette's Syndrome, one leg, gross obesity and one is even a giant
_ and, while it purports to show how empathetic Deuce is in his
efforts to help the women feel at ease, there's a nasty taste left
at its making fun of, and exploiting, their plights in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider has done some supporting bits in Adam Sandler's last
two films, ``Big Daddy'' and ``The Waterboy,'' and in each instance
he was moderately funny because he wasn't the focus. But a little
of Schneider goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   And a little of ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' _ an insufferably
dull-witted comedy trying to achieve the same twisted dark comedic
tone as ``There's Something About Mary'' _ goes even further.
</P>
<P>
   Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. Directed by Mike Mitchell. Written
by Harris Goldberg, Rob Schneider. Cast: Rob Schneider, Oded Fehr.
Touchstone Pictures. 84 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual
content.

AS A RICHLY TEXTURED THRILLER, `GREEN MILE' GOES THE DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't that many years ago that any movie that operated off
an occult theme was automatically considered to be exploitation
fodder. Adaptations of Stephen King's more ghoulish novels, in
particular, were invariably low-budget affairs with third-level
stars and no press screening.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, the occult has joined the mainstream, a trend
that should continue with the mega-success of last summer's ``The
Sixth Sense.'' In fact, there are darn few movies these days that
don't accept the existence of ghosts, angels, demons, aliens,
prophecies, miracles, or some other unearthly being or unseen
energy.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no huge surprise that one of our decade-ending holiday
movie season biggies is a three-hour adaptation of a Stephen King
occult thriller that boasts arguably Hollywood's biggest male star
_ Tom Hanks _ and is played in the kind of leisurely-paced, low-key
manner that we normally associate with serious-minded, ``prestige''
Hollywood dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Told in flashback (with an opening and closing that recalls
``Saving Private Ryan'' perhaps a bit too deliberately), it's the
story of a kind-hearted security guard (Hanks) who runs the death
row _ the ``Green Mile'' of the title _ of a Mississippi prison in
the bleak Depression year of 1935.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the Mile gets a new prisoner: a gigantic
(seven-foot-plus, 300 pounds), seemingly simple-minded man (Michael
Clarke Duncan) who has been convicted of the unspeakably brutal
rape-murder of two small children but is _ paradoxically _ gentle,
deathly afraid of the dark and in possession of miraculous powers
of healing.
</P>
<P>
   So the film becomes an occult thriller, as the guard gradually
comes to grasp the full extent of the man's power; a detective
story, as he struggles to ferret out the facts behind the man's
alleged crime; and an intense prison drama, with internal feuds,
political maneuvering and other parallels to such classics of the
genre as ``The Last Mile'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone going into the film expecting a typical King thrill-fest
is bound to be disappointed, and possibly even bored. To be sure,
gory elements _ rape-murder, ghoulish executions, much prison
brutality _ are present in spades, but they're not really staged
for titillation, and the tone and style are far removed from the
grab-you-by-the-throat horror of ``Cujo'' or ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is much more character-driven, and is handled in a more
classic filmmaking style by director-writer Frank Darabont, who is
never afraid to take the time he feels is necessary to establish
secondary characters and a complex web of relationships. The film
is even more textured and less gratuitous than ``The Shawshank
Redemption,'' Darabont's 1994 adaptation of another Stephen King
prison story.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is especially strong. Duncan is wonderfully
tortured and sympathetic as the Christ-like healer; veteran
character actor Dabbs Greer gives an engaging, career-topping
performance as the elderly version of the Hanks character; and
James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Michael Jeter, Patricia
Clarkson and Doug Hutchison are all memorable.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Hanks holds all these elements together with his own
effortless magic. As he grows older and more jowly, he seems to be
settling ever more gracefully into his star persona, secure enough
to allow his character to be flawed, generous enough to give much
screen time to his supporting players, so completely appealing that
it's becoming harder and harder to dispute the contention that he's
Jimmy Stewart's replacement as Hollywood's great Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Mile. Directed and written by Frank Darabont. Cast:
Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, James Cromwell,
Bonnie Hunt. Warner Bros. 180 minutes. Rated R for horror, prison
violence, and language.

BRADLEY LEAFLET DROPS THE GLOVES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Bill Bradley's genteel, high-minded campaign
of ideas dropped all traces of politeness Thursday in the
increasingly bitter battle for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers fanned out across the state, handing out mock
prescription forms in front of drugstores. The disease?
``Gore-itis.'' The symptoms? ``Uncontrollable lying.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign leaflet prescribed a lifetime supply of truth serum
for Vice President Al Gore. And the directions said Gore should
``take a healthy dose daily, especially when talking about the Bill
Bradley health plan.'' Failure to do so would result in
``uncontrollable negative campaigning, lack of respect for the
voters of New Hampshire and further abandonment of the principle of
health care for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The counter-attack came 24 hours after senior citizens stood
outside drug stores in 11 towns throughout the state, passing out
glossy mailers declaring that Gore would provide a prescription
drug benefit for Medicare recipients, and he would fight the drug
companies to get lower-priced prescription drugs on the market more
quickly. They also passed out a separate flier that provided a
side-by-side comparison of Gore and Bradley's records on regulation
of drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has become increasingly frustrated in
recent weeks watching Gore pick apart their candidate's health care
plan. The vice president has charged, in various settings, that the
Bradley proposal would destroy Medicaid, endanger health care for
African Americans and people who suffer from the HIV virus, and put
the elderly at risk by eliminating all nursing home standards.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid, the health
insurance program for the poor and disabled, it would replace it
with subsidies for private insurance _ subsidies which Gore derides
as inadequate. Bradley has angrily rejected the the idea that
minorities, or nursing home residents or those with HIV have
anything to fear from his plan. And he regards Gore's rival
proposal as ``timid'' and inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Though the language in Bradley's flier was sharp Thursday _ and
reminiscent, to some New Hampshire primary veterans, of Bob Dole's
1988 ``stop lying about my record'' rebuke _ campaign officials
were adamant that some things finally needed to be said about the
Gore offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be shy in pointing out whenever the vice
president and his campaign are distorting our record,'' said Mo
Elleithee, Bradley's New Hampshire spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they went over the top when they started using scare
tactics to scare seniors and the disabled and other people into
thinking that the Bradley plan would leave them out in the cold
when the Gore campaign knows that's not true,'' Elleithee said.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Gore campaign was not amused by the charges
of lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on legitimate issues and the Bradley campaign
is launching negative personal attacks,'' said Douglas Hattaway,
Gore's spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only put out confirmed facts, but unfortunately for Bill
Bradley, the facts don't always tell a pretty story,'' Hattaway
said. ``The fact is, he was called the drug industry's most
effective defender in Congress. The fact is, he sided with the drug
companies in an attempt to keep generic drugs off the market for up
to 24 years. Al Gore fought the drug companies to provide less
expensive generics for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, the sharp exchange was welcomed by Gore, who
has been trying to bait Bradley into looking and sounding more like
a typical politician. The angry accusations of lying, officials
hoped, will take Bradley off his non-political pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the prescription drug benefit promised by both
candidates, Gore says his would cover the first $5,000 in drug
costs, reaching 90 percent of all seniors on Medicare with no
deductible. Bradley would require a $500 deductible before the
perscription drug coverage kicks in, with no cap on the benefits
received after that. According to a report by the American
Association of Retired Persons this week, the average senior
citizen pays $413 out of pocket for prescription drugs.

AS A RICHLY TEXTURED THRILLER, `GREEN MILE' GOES THE DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't that many years ago that any movie that operated off
an occult theme was automatically considered to be exploitation
fodder. Adaptations of Stephen King's more ghoulish novels, in
particular, were invariably low-budget affairs with third-level
stars and no press screening.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, the occult has joined the mainstream, a trend
that should continue with the mega-success of last summer's ``The
Sixth Sense.'' In fact, there are darn few movies these days that
don't accept the existence of ghosts, angels, demons, aliens,
prophecies, miracles, or some other unearthly being or unseen
energy.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no huge surprise that one of our decade-ending holiday
movie season biggies is a three-hour adaptation of a Stephen King
occult thriller that boasts arguably Hollywood's biggest male star
_ Tom Hanks _ and is played in the kind of leisurely-paced, low-key
manner that we normally associate with serious-minded, ``prestige''
Hollywood dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Told in flashback (with an opening and closing that recalls
``Saving Private Ryan'' perhaps a bit too deliberately), it's the
story of a kind-hearted security guard (Hanks) who runs the death
row _ the ``Green Mile'' of the title _ of a Mississippi prison in
the bleak Depression year of 1935.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the Mile gets a new prisoner: a gigantic
(seven-foot-plus, 300 pounds), seemingly simple-minded man (Michael
Clarke Duncan) who has been convicted of the unspeakably brutal
rape-murder of two small children but is _ paradoxically _ gentle,
deathly afraid of the dark and in possession of miraculous powers
of healing.
</P>
<P>
   So the film becomes an occult thriller, as the guard gradually
comes to grasp the full extent of the man's power; a detective
story, as he struggles to ferret out the facts behind the man's
alleged crime; and an intense prison drama, with internal feuds,
political maneuvering and other parallels to such classics of the
genre as ``The Last Mile'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone going into the film expecting a typical King thrill-fest
is bound to be disappointed, and possibly even bored. To be sure,
gory elements _ rape-murder, ghoulish executions, much prison
brutality _ are present in spades, but they're not really staged
for titillation, and the tone and style are far removed from the
grab-you-by-the-throat horror of ``Cujo'' or ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is much more character-driven, and is handled in a more
classic filmmaking style by director-writer Frank Darabont, who is
never afraid to take the time he feels is necessary to establish
secondary characters and a complex web of relationships. The film
is even more textured and less gratuitous than ``The Shawshank
Redemption,'' Darabont's 1994 adaptation of another Stephen King
prison story.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is especially strong. Duncan is wonderfully
tortured and sympathetic as the Christ-like healer; veteran
character actor Dabbs Greer gives an engaging, career-topping
performance as the elderly version of the Hanks character; and
James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Michael Jeter, Patricia
Clarkson and Doug Hutchison are all memorable.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Hanks holds all these elements together with his own
effortless magic. As he grows older and more jowly, he seems to be
settling ever more gracefully into his star persona, secure enough
to allow his character to be flawed, generous enough to give much
screen time to his supporting players, so completely appealing that
it's becoming harder and harder to dispute the contention that he's
Jimmy Stewart's replacement as Hollywood's great Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Mile. Directed and written by Frank Darabont. Cast:
Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, James Cromwell,
Bonnie Hunt. Warner Bros. 180 minutes. Rated R for horror, prison
violence, and language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

 &HT;    For Blaylock in exile, no happy homecoming
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a homecoming of sorts tonight at Philips Arena
for Mookie Blaylock. Seven years the Hawks' point guard, Blaylock
is the floor general for the beleaguered Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking forward to seeing some of his old teammates, but
don't expect him to be nostalgic about facing the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Blaylock was most excited about returning to Atlanta to
see his dog, a golden retriever. Blaylock, 31, talked more fondly
of giving ``Digger'' his nightly walk and splashing around in a
nearby river than he did about seeing old cohorts. ``He calls me
every day,'' Blaylock said about Digger. The dog lives with a
house-sitter in the home that the 6-foot-1 guard still maintains in
suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock plans to live here after he retires from the game. But
his allegiance to the Hawks ended after he was traded in June to
Golden State for the No. 10 pick in the draft, Jason Terry; Bimbo
Coles; and the since-released Duane Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some good years here,'' Blaylock said, ``but I'm the
type of person that couldn't care less about the Hawks now.''
</P>
<P>
   He named Dikembe Mutombo and Alan Henderson as teammates
remaining on the club that he was the closest to. For all the
criticism Blaylock received for a game that deteriorated to a
barrage of 3-point shots, his departure hit some of the players
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to believe (the trade) when it happened,''
Mutombo said. ``It'll be hard to look at him in a different
uniform. He was a really special teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock, averaging just 8.7 points on 33 percent shooting,
wonders how the fans will receive him. Earlier this week, he
watched teammate John Starks get a rousing standing ovation during
his first return to New York against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might hear some boos,'' he said. ``It was great what John
got in New York. To get what he got lets him know the people really
appreciated what he did for the team. You have to respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock might not have played well all the time, but he
certainly put out the effort, which left an imprint on the Hawks.
He earned their respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mookie did a great job for us,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``I
know last season was tough on him because he didn't shoot the ball
as well as he'd like. But he always gave 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors saw that. They had playoff aspirations, and they
deemed Blaylock the point guard to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can he shoot? Yeah,'' coach P.J. Carlesimo said when Blaylock
was acquired. ``Can he make free throws? Yeah. Can he get to the
rim? Yeah. Can he run the pick-and-roll? Yeah. Can he guard other
guards? Yeah. He's got a lot of yesses in his portfolio. That's the
thing I like most about him.''
</P>
<P>
   That despite Blaylock's subpar season last year in which he shot
just 38 percent _ 31 percent on 3-pointers _ with just 5.8 assists
a game. Not even Blaylock could deny he was far from his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a great year; it could have been better,'' he said.
``Instead of relaxing and going out and playing, I put a lot of
pressure on myself. That kind of threw me off.''
</P>
<P>
   He must really be thrown off now, for the Warriors are in a
shambles. Blaylock never experienced the kind of hopelessness he
faces now in his first season with Golden State. A checklist of
trouble as long as a Blaylock 3-pointer marks the Warriors, a team
mired in an 11-game losing streak that has threatened the job
security of Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   They face the Hawks as the Pacific Division's cellar-dweller at
2-16. They have not won a game in nearly a month. They have a
former All-Star in Starks, unhappy with his role as a reserve and
slowed by an ankle injury. Centers Erick Dampier and Tim Young and
small forward Donyell Marshall are on the injured list. Forwards
Terry Cummings and Chris Mills are battling bad ankles and might
not play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Warriors are last in the NBA in field-goal
percentage, 25th in free-throw shooting and 25th in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Worse of all, a loser's mentality seemingly has set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you can sustain some success,'' Starks said, ``it's
always in the back of your mind that you're going to end up
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jason Caffey said: ``It doesn't make sense for us to go
out and play hard and, when it's closing time, you chicken out. It
doesn't make sense to play hard and then not believe in
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors have trouble scoring and defending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic defense,'' Blaylock said. ``We're not really playing
that. In high school, what does the coach say? `Ball, you, man.'
That's high school stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk does not bode well for Carlesimo. Neither does
it when general manager Garry St. Jean says: ``Here's where it's
at. Anybody who's watched us so far has a right to be upset, and we
understand that. You can't use alibis in this league. Injuries are
part of the game, and we've been hit. That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough way right now.

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The streets of this grief-stricken city
became a winding stream of mourners Thursday morning as thousands
of firefighters led a three-mile procession to honor six of their
own, killed last week while battling a fire in an abandoned
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The sky was cloudless, but smoke still billowed from that
windowless building.
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton and a host of politicians eulogized
the firefighters at a service in the Worcester Centrum, an arena in
the heart of downtown, dozens of firefighters and search dogs
continued to sift through the rubble of the warehouse for the
bodies of four of the firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your men are ours,'' Clinton told those at the service. ``Our
whole country honors them and you. We grieve with you, and we will
stay with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A homeless couple, who the authorities believe may have
accidentally started the fire when they knocked over a candle, are
being held on $1 million bail; both have pleaded not guilty to
charges of involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In this blue-collar city, where nearly everyone seems to have
some connection to a firefighter, the tight fraternity of
firefighters was on full display. The streets, lined deep on both
sides with an estimated 25,000 spectators, were eerily quiet, the
silence broken only by the dirge of bagpipes and snares.
</P>
<P>
   Parents propped their children on their shoulders. A long row of
construction workers stood at the end of the procession route,
yellow hard hats tucked under their arms. The Boston Fire
Department led the procession, bearing flags of Ireland anUnited States.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters came from as far as Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Fort
Wayne, Ind., and an Amtrak train full of firefighters arrived from
Connecticut early in the morning. Some came to march in their dress
uniforms, others to fill the memorial service in the Centrum, still
others who could not get in to watch the service on big-screen TVs
inside the pubs lining Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope by our collective presence we will speak louder than
words and say your tragedy is ours,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the six firefighters left six widows and 15
children.
</P>
<P>
   While struggling with their grief, many city residents expressed
compassion for the two squatters who fled from a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when cities nationwide have imposed new measures
against the homeless, there was little clamor here for punishment
of the homeless in general, or the accused couple in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a mistake,'' said Fred Stone, 43, a telemarketer who
had come to watch the firefighters dig through the rubble late
Wednesday night. ``They're not responsible for the deaths of six
firefighters. You have to put yourself in a homeless person's body.
You're going to find a place to go and you're going to build a
fire. It's the nature of people to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few here seemed to know the pair. Thomas S. Levesque, 37,
rolled a shopping cart every day, foraging for cans. His
girlfriend, Julie S. Barnes, 19, is three months pregnant,
according to her lawyer. Both volunteered at a soup kitchen called
the Mustard Seed, and Levesque tried repeatedly to find jobs,
recalled another volunteer, Michele Sampson. On Thursday Ms.
Sampson, who is also homeless, said she planned to write to the
couple in jail and offer to care for the baby they are expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester, once a hub of textile plants and wiremaking
factories, has been struggling to reinvent itself. Its population
has declined steadily in the last three decades to about 166,000
today. Its gleaming downtown has a new outlet mall and the Centrum
arena. The old railroad station, with its elaborate white domes,
has been renovated. But just on the edge of downtown is the swath
of old warehouses and narrow streets lined with auto repair shops
and butcher shops _ still busy with daytime traffic but also
natural resting place for the homeless at night.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John A. Coonan, the pastor of St. John's Church, a
stone's throw from the abandoned warehouse, says pointedly that
only after nearby Union Station, a once dilapidated train station
where dozens of homeless slept every night, closed for renovations
did buildings like the warehouse where the firefighters died,
Worcester Cold Storage, become regular dormitories for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 1,000 shelter beds in the city have all been
occupied since summer. ``I believe to the core of my being that we
are all responsible for that fire,'' said Coonan. ``Worcester has
not seriously taken on the challenge of homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was well known that homeless people squatted in the Worcester
Cold Storage building. That is why firefighters raced in on Friday
night, thinking someone might be trapped inside. No one was. The
homeless couple fled the building and failed to report the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some had little sympathy for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear no excuses,'' fumed Dian Germain, 40, a
waitress who stood in front of the Central Fire Station Thursday
morning for the procession. ``That's all they had to do _ say there
was nobody in the building.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, firefighters have repeatedly said in recent days that
their job was not to pass judgment against the people who are
accused, but to find the bodies of all those who perished. In the
last few days, as food and drink has poured into local fire
stations, some of it has been passed on to homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, firefighters have retrieved only the bodies of Timothy
Jackson, 51, and James Lyons, 34. Still missing are Paul
Brotherton, 41, Jeremiah Lucey, 38, Joseph McGuirk, 38, and Thomas
Spencer, 42.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, a visibly exhausted deputy chief of the
Worcester Fire Department, Gerry Dio, said the search had yielded
no new clues. Fire officials said they had combed through about 50
to 60 percent of the five-story brick building, a thickly insulated
catacomb where cattle carcasses and hamburger patties were stored.
They vowed to find the other four bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like Day One because everyone's not out,'' said Jim
Sweeney, a firefighter from nearby Auburn, who has helped with the
search since Friday. ``We're trying to get closure. Everyone's got
to come home.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For them, a fire truck parked near the Cold Storage building has
been transformed into a shrine, literally shrouded with bouquets of
mums and carnations, poems and letters. All day and all night, it
has drawn visitors and it has reduced burly men to tears. There is
a collage with painted hearts and sad faces, a wreath from the
Worcester AIDS project and a framed Fire Wife's Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is this deeply personal letter from a
sixth-grader named Laurencia. She writes of a father she has not
seen since she was 5. ``At least I do know he is alive, she writes.
``But still I feel like I have lost my father too just like those
15 children.''

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA should quickly improve its ability
to monitor and forecast the radiation levels that pose a health
risk to spacewalking astronauts as they build the U.S.-led
international space station, the National Research Council reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The research council urged the space agency to equip the outside
of the orbital outpost with radiation monitors as soon as possible.
It also called for better use of the radiation level information
already gathered by existing satellites to avoid spacewalks during
the periods of greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Though not immediately life-threatening even in worst-case
estimates, episodes of high radiation could equal the equivalent of
several hundred chest X-rays, increasing an astronaut's risk of
cancer later in life, said George Siscoe, the Boston University
space physics researcher who chaired the council's 10-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   With monitors on the exterior of the station that constantly
relay radiation levels on the station to NASA's Mission Control
Center and better use of satellite information about solar storms,
NASA flight directors would have greater flexibility in the
scheduling of assembly missions as well as spacewalks to lessen the
exposure, the panel reported.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has referred the report's findings to the agency's Johnson
Space Center, where the recommendations will be reviewed by medical
experts, said John Ira Petty, a spokesman for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the space agency observes Occupational Safety and
Health Administration guidelines for 30-day and one-year exposure
limits. But unanticipated exposures could limit the number of
spacewalks astronauts could participate in during a single flight
as well as their availability for assignments on subsequent
missions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limits for eye and skin are rather small, and these are
the things that can affect the timing and the decisions that flight
directors have to worry about,'' said Siscoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth's magnetic field furnishes a natural barrier to much
of the harmful radiation that streams from the sun and deep space.
</P>
<P>
   Started in late 1998, the construction of the new orbital
outpost nonetheless will correspond with the maximum period of
activity during the 11-year solar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly will require at least 43 more spaceflights through
at least 2004. During construction, at least 161 two-astronaut
spacewalks are planned, placing astronauts outside the safety of
the space shuttle or the station itself for more than 1,700 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Based on its assessments of radiation fluctuations during the
most recent solar cycle, there is a 100 percent chance that at
least two future station assembly missions will coincide with high
solar radiation levels and a 50 percent chance that five of the
flights will, the research council said.
</P>
<P>
   The first two modules of the new station were joined in orbit
last December by spacewalking astronauts. The station's first crew
module is to launch early next year, with the first resident crew
to follow in the spring.

RUSSIAN LEADER COMPLAINS OF LACK OF RESPECT FROM U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-CHECHNYA) 
(sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Boris Yeltsin, clearly bristling over
President Clinton's criticism of Russia's military assault on
Chechnya, complained on Thursday that the United States was not
treating Russia with the respect due a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton permitted himself to put pressure on
Russia,'' Yeltsin said, loudly and deliberately, in front of
television cameras after he arrived here on Thursday for a day and
a half of meetings with Chinese leaders. ``It seems he has for a
minute forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton played down Yeltsin's remarks, saying,
``We can't get too serious about that.'' But he repeated his
insistence that Russia's strategy to suppress secessionist rebels
in Chechnya, which has involved large-scale bombardment of civilian
areas, is counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with what's going on there,'' he said. ``And I
think I have an obligation to say so.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in China, which has rejected international criticism of
its own harsh treatment of restive ethnic minorities as unwarranted
interference in its internal affairs, Yeltsin's Chechnya campaign
was vigorously endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Jiang said he completely understood and fully
supported Russia's actions in combating terrorism and extremism in
Chechnya,'' reported Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov,
after Yeltsin met with President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite poor health _ last week he battled pneumonia and he
reportedly traveled here against his doctors' advice _ Yeltsin was
obviously primed to launch a broadside against Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made his apparently calculated outburst as he and Li
Peng, the head of China's legislature, posed for photographs before
their meeting. He turned to the cameras to remind Clinton of
Russia's nuclear status and warn, ``It has never been and never
will be the case that he will dictate to the whole world how to
live''
</P>
<P>
   ``A multipolar world _ that is the basis for everything,'' he
continued, in remarks that were broadcast repeatedly on Thursday in
Russia, where preparations for the Dec. 19 parliamentary elections
are under way. ``We will dictate to the world. Not him, not him
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a faltering world power, and China, an aspiring one, are
united in fear of U.S. domination, and the statements issued on
Thursday emphasized their shared support for a world with no single
pre-eminent power. The countries signed two new border agreements
and reaffirmed the ``strategic partnership'' they have extolled in
summit meetings over the last several years, an effort to erase
past tensions and counter U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-hungry Russia has been an important seller of weapons to
China, but trade between the countries remains modest and a serious
military alliance between the historical rivals is unlikely,
Western diplomats say. Both countries also badly want U.S. economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia, both worried about potential ethnic unrest at
home as well as by American swagger, found common cause earlier
this year in opposing NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
They vehemently condemned it as a criminal violation of a sovereign
country's control over its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries also emphasized on Thursday their shared
opposition to U.S. plans for an antimissile defense system, which
they say will only set off a global arms race.
</P>
<P>
   As for Chechnya, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry,
Zhang Qiyue, said on Thursday that ``China understands and supports
the efforts made by Russia in safeguarding national unity and
territorial integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside the global outcry over Russia's shelling and
bombing of towns and threats to obliterate remaining inhabitants of
the Chechen capital of Grozny, she added, ``We have also taken note
of the fact that in the Chechnya action, the Russian side has tried
to avoid civilian losses as much as it can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Moscow on Thursday, Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin,
tried to play down Yeltsin's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to draw your attention to the fact that we have very
good relations with the United States,'' he told reporters. ``I
would consider it absolutely incorrect to produce the impression
that some kind of period of cooling off of relations between Russia
and the United States has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, in remarks that seemed to have wounded
Yeltsin's pride as leader of a global power, Clinton criticized the
brutal Chechnya offensive, saying that it undermined Russia's
prestige and risked alienating international investors and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may believe that because of their position in the United
Nations and because no one wants them to fail and have more
problems than they've got, that they can do this,'' he said on
Wednesday. ``I don't think the strategy will work.''

FOR THE BROTHERHOOD, NO CHOICE BUT TO CARRY ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Long after the flow of official words ran dry
Thursday, long after the last strains of ``Taps'' melted into the
rafters, thousands of firefighters found themselves drawn to the
place they know best: the nearest firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   They ate homemade American chop suey off paper plates. They
drank Pepsi from the can. And some of the more curious drifted
upstairs and gazed across the vast, communal bedroom that
firefighters Paul Brotherton and Jeremiah Lucey used to call home.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much to look at, really, with its scratched linoleum
floors, faded beige wallpaper, and long rows of twin metal beds.
But it explains something more.
</P>
<P>
   It explains this concept of brotherhood so frequently mentioned
in this city these last tortuous days. It explains the sea of tears
shed by brawny men. It explains why upwards of 30,000 firefighters
from across the country and around the world arrived to pay final
respects to six men they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like family,'' Jay Olson, a lieutenant from Portland,
Ore., was saying of the men in his company. ``You prepare meals
together. You eat at the same table. You're sleeping in the same
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know everything about everyone else's business,'' he
added. ``The gifts they're buying for Christmas, their marital
problems, their kids' grades at school. The outside world, they
don't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 17 had their fathers taken away in last Friday's fire. A
city mourns. And an entire profession is once again brought to its
collective knee.
</P>
<P>
   The last heroes, firefighters are often called. They may well be
that and more. In a nation obsessed with every blip in interest
rates, at a time in our history when courage is seen as a $10
million-a-year outfielder playing with a sore shoulder.
firefighters provide a link to a more purposeful, more glorious
past.
</P>
<P>
   They are a different breed. They work in long shifts that often
extend through the night. They rush into burning buildings for
$50,000 a year. They pass their jobs from father to son. And
precious few of them ever leave to do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So six of them die in Worcester, and countless thousands of
their brethren put themselves in their emmpty boots.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bill Fuller of Ashland, Mass., who sat inside the Worcester
Centrum Thursday to pay tribute to the fallen six. His grandfather
was a firefigther. His father was a firefighter. He retired as a
firefighter two years ago. And his son is a firefighter now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave your wife and kids every day and go spend your time
with your second family,'' he said. ``It's in the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   They are bitten early by the bug. They see the gleaming
firetrucks scream down their streets. They watch as tough men in
rubbery uniforms transcend fear. They are seduced by the physical,
aggressive nature of the work.
</P>
<P>
   They develop, quite literally, a blind trust in each other's
abilities. They trundle into smokey buildings in pairs, unable to
see more than a foot ahead. They eat each other's cooking, watch
ballgames together on threadbare chairs. They share bathrooms,
lockers, and beds.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the Centrum, Lieutenant David McCourt recalled
falling through a weakened floor a few years back in a house fire
in his native Medford, Mass. He clung to a wooden beam above a
swirl of flames until another firefighter came by and pulled him
up.
</P>
<P>
   That other firefighter was his father. ``He told me not to ever
let that happen again,'' McCourt said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stationhouse, they form bonds that even the hottest
flames can't burn away. They talk, they joke, they pull pranks. The
universal rule of firefighters: Never, ever, let your brethren know
what bothers you, or you'll live with it for the rest of your
career.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter Henry Cullen of North Providence, R.I. recalls a
particularly fastidious lieutenant who demanded once too often that
the firehouse be cleaned. So his troops hid a vacuum cleaner under
his bed and strung a series of extension cords along the wall. When
they turned it on at 4 a.m., a whole group of men were there to
watch their fearless leader bolt from his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks the monotony,'' said Cullen. ``Sometimes you don't
stop moving for 20 hours, but sometimes you don't move at all for
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Another North Providence firefighter bragged too much about the
gas mileage of his new car, so his colleagues began covertly adding
fuel to his tank while he was keeping track of his miles. A couple
of weeks later, they began siphoning gas out and listened
sympathetically as he expressed confusion about his falling
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   How many beds have been moved to the roof? How many buckets of
water dumped on each other? How many foul casseroles hanged in
effigy from a kitchen pipe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this 21 years and I see new and amazing things
every day,'' said Mark Simmons, a battalion chief from Tempe, Ariz.
``You do everything you can to humiliate and annoy and haze
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the scene of a fire, there are no jokes. The often ragtag
collection of men _ and the rare woman _ suddenly become symphonic
in their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a guy on the hydrant, you have an apparatus guy, you
have someone else on the hose,'' said Rick Woerth, another
firefighter from Tempe, Ariz. ``And the captain is the quarterback,
running the play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like that last Friday evening at the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co. Firefighters entered the burning building
in pairs, and they died in pairs. As six of them were missing in
treacheous flames and smoke, their brethren had to be restrained
from plunging in anew.
</P>
<P>
   It's different than it used to be. The equipment is better these
days, more sophisticated. But because of that, firemen tend to take
greater risks. Buildings are more laden with sythetic materials,
which tend to burn hotter and faster than wood.
</P>
<P>
   And death lurks every night on every call, in places where they
least suspect it. Places like vacant warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   So now, firefighters at two stations here will eventually have
to clean out the lockers of the dead _ Lucey and Brotherton, Thomas
Spencer, James Lyons, Timothy Jackson and Joseph McGuirk.
</P>
<P>
   They'll fold their sheets. They'll walk uneasily past their
favorite easy chairs in the station lounge. They'll mourn the
casseroles that won't be baked, the pranks that will never be
plotted, the half-cocked dreams left unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, the survivors, this city, and the entire
profession will summon the strength to carry on. For firefighters
and their families, too often there is no choice.

CROSS-SECTION OF SOCIETY HONORS BRAVERY OF SIX FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The silence inside the Worcester Centrum
Thursday resonated loudly. Somber, riveting and reflective, the
church-like quiet from 15,000 people carried gratitude and awed
respect for six brave firefighters who died last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Grown men dabbed at their eyes, family members clung to one
another, and mourners from all ranks of society focused with
profound attention on the tributes delivered by speakers from
President Clinton to Worcester Fire Chief Dennis Budd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is overwhelming, but it doesn't surprise me,'' said Brian
Borneman, a firefighter in Merrimack, N.H. ``Fighting a fire is the
closest thing to combat there is. You see people at their worst,
and you see people at their best.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial was a rich, moving spectacle. Praise for public
service, tributes for the unhestitating courage of the dead
firefighters, and reminders that the unheralded often perform the
most remarkable deeds were combined in a service that acknowledged
a city's grief with a celebration of the best of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hero is an average citizen who does something extraordinary
to help someone in need,'' said Worcester Mayor Raymond V. Mariano.
``A hero is a firefighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The solemn pageantry inside the arena, where a sea of white
gloves snapped to attention in a show of expressive symmetry, was
also evident on the city's streets. For more than two hours,
firefighters from all across the country and several foreign
nations saluted their Worcester comrades as they marched in
dignified cadence past the Central Station.
</P>
<P>
   There, weary men who have scoured the rubble of the Worcester
Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. for nearly a week, stood atop fire
trucks parked outside the crepe-fringed bays of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Hats off, but still wearing soot-soiled clothing, the Worcester
firefighters gazed with grim but grateful expression as their
far-flung brotherhood passed by. The remains of four firefighters
still lie hidden in the charred remnants of the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   After 13,000 firefighters filed into the Centrum, an equal
number filled the streets around the arena to follow the service
via remote broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was former Brockton fire chief Edward Burrell, an
85-year-old ex-firefighter haunted by long-ago memories even as he
honored the six men who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   More than most, Burrell understands the horrific loss that has
touched so many in this small-town city. He recalls the rain-soaked
memorial for nine Boston firefighters killed at the Hotel Vendome
in 1972, the trip to New York City to honor 12 firefighters who
perished in a blazing store in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But the terrible night of March 10, 1941, even now, is never far
from his thoughts. For in the early morning of that frigid day,
Burrell lost 13 of his comrades from the Brockton Fire Department
as the snow-laden roof of the burning Strand Theatre collapsed upon
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you hear about lives lost, your mind reverts to what
we went through,'' Burrell said. ``It was devastating, especially
being young. Everything went through our minds, thinking of all the
families. Several of those who were killed were young fellas with
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell walked the entire 1 1/2-mile processional route
Thursday. ``Hell, there's nothing to it,'' he said. ``You just put
one foot in front of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benoit of Paxton stood by that route to pay silent
respects to all the firefighters who marched Thursday, including
her husband, Michael, who battled the fatal fire last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are everyday heroes who are not recognized,'' Benoit
said. ``People might look to sports stars, but these are the real
heroes. You have firemen and policemen who risk their lives all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph O'Brien, a New York City firefighter stationed in Spanish
Harlem, agreed that tragedy is often a catalyst that renews respect
for his profession. O'Brien drove a car to Worcester for the
service, a sign of brotherhood with six men he never met.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien shrugged off any resentment about the ``respect'' issue.
``It's the same with any job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the public confidence that is routinely placed in
firefighters helps explain the humbled respect that filled the
Centrum. Dignitaries and public servants alike, high-ranking state
officials to rookie firefighters, showed by their rapt attention
and unmoving posture that these men _ Paul A. Brotherton, Timothy
P. Jackson, Jeremiah M. Lucey, James F. Lyons, Joseph T. McGuirk,
and Thomas E. Spencer _ lived worthy lives.
</P>
<P>
   The evocative strains of ``Amazing Grace'' _ first from a lone
bagpiper, then from an ensemble and chorus _ brought many in the
arena to tears. Wives and children of the slain firefighters
embraced, wept, and grieved for a loss they can never replace.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Burrell reflected on how his life was spared in the
Strand Theatre blaze, only because the roof collapsed minutes
before his company had planned to attack the building.
</P>
<P>
   Only three men are still alive who battled that fire, he said,
but still they gather every March 10 to recall the sacrifices made
in what remains the single greatest loss of life in Massachusetts
firefighting history.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, like his Worcester comrades, says he regrets nothing.
The rewards, he explains, are ``rescuing people and protecting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our job,'' Burrell says, ``just like those fellas.''

AS EXPERTS LISTEN, FAMILIES OFFER SUPPORT FOR GENE THERAPY TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Md., Pa., Calif., N.J.)   (jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Paul Gelsinger, his voice quivering but his
composure intact, stepped to the microphone in a crowded auditorium
here at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite three months ago, Gelsinger's 18-year-old son, Jesse,
became the first person killed by gene therapy. Thursday, Gelsinger
addressed the hundreds of scientists gathered here this week to
examine the experiment that cost Jesse his life.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger, a handyman from Tucson, Ariz., asked the members of
the audience to reach into their pockets and take quarters.
Throughout the hall, the rustling of purses and the jingling of
coins could be heard. He noted the language on the coin: ``In God
we trust. You don't see that too much in government anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He then told how Jesse, a clerk in a supermarket, had taken
unpaid leave to participate in the experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania, even though it was not intended to benefit him but
rather babies with a fatal form of the rare metabolic disorder from
which he suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people who participated in this trial did a
wonderful thing,'' said Gelsinger, who has said that in dying, his
son taught him how to live. ``They came in with the same intent my
son had. It doesn't get any purer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's speech, which was greeted with lengthy applause,
provided a moment of humanity on the second-day of a three-day
meeting of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the National
Institutes of Health panel that oversees gene therapy research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to examining the experiment in which Jesse Gelsinger
died, the committee was considering the safety of adenovirus, the
weakened cold virus that was used as to deliver healthy DNA to the
patients in the Pennsylvania study, and was also debating rules
that would force scientists to make public more of their safety
data.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering has been marked by acrimony between scientists at
the University of Pennsylvania, whom Gelsinger has said he
supports, and officials of the Food and Drug Administration, who on
Wednesday held a news conference to accuse the scientists of
several lapses, including improperly admitting Jesse into the
study, altering the informed consent form given to patients and
failing to immediately report safety data that could have put a
stop to the clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, the talk was toned down, as the Penn
investigators, led by James Wilson, director of the Institute for
Human Gene Therapy at the university, and FDA officials gave
lengthy presentations of their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his colleagues pointedly apologized to the agency for
specific failings, and Wilson reiterated what he said on Wednesday
in response to the agency's charges: ``At no time during or prior
to this trial did we in any way expect to see what we saw in Jesse
Gelsinger.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials delivered only muted criticism Thursday, noting
the lapses by the researchers in bland, bureaucratic language while
they presented the preliminary results of their inquiry into the
death.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Siegel, the agency official who supervises gene therapy
reviews, noted that the experiment had been monitored closely; the
FDA, he said, reviewed 20 amendments to the original protocol, and
the two sides communicated either by telephone or fax 50 times
during the course of the two-year clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, W. French Anderson, a gene therapy expert at the
University of Southern California who is regarded as the father of
the field, hinted that some kind of agreement had been reached.
``There was a realization that this had gone too far,'' Anderson
said, referring to the FDA. ``Yesterday they were blasting Penn.
Today they basically accepted Pennsylvania as dealing with them in
good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few interesting scientific facts to come out of
Thursday's meeting. The Penn scientists are still not certain why
Jesse Gelsinger, who suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase
deficiency, suffered an reaction to the adenovirus that was so
severe that it killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy findings discussed Thursday offered a possible
explanation: Jesse's bone marrow had abnormalities that might have
existed before the therapy, suggesting that, unbeknownst to the
researchers, he might have been infected with a second cold virus,
parvovirus.
</P>
<P>
   Were that the case, Anderson said, the parvovirus could have
triggered the reactions _ jaundice, a blood-clotting disorder,
kidney failure, lung failure and ultimately brain death _ that
Jesse experienced after receiving the adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   With their ability to infect cells, viruses are useful in gene
therapy because doctors can use them to deliver healthy DNA to
patients. More than 300 gene therapy experiments have been
conducted since 1990, and the adenovirus has been used in more than
a quarter of them. But now, its usage may be limited. Researchers
said Thursday that it seemed clear that patients who received
adenovirus tolerated it well up to a certain point, but once the
dosage passed that threshold, the side effects became significant.
</P>
<P>
   In the Penn study, 19 patients with ornithine transcarbamylase
deficiency were divided into three groups, each receiving a higher
dose than the last. Investigators expected to see a gradual
escalation of side effects, Wilson said, so that the study could be
stopped before any patients were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But more than science, Thursday was a day for patients,
including the mothers of children with the deficiency, a disorder
that, even when not fatal in infancy, often causes coma, brain
damage and death. As did Gelsinger, the mothers pleaded with the
committee to allow the research to continue, saying it was their
only hope for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   As Claudia Mickelson, the committee's chairwoman, fought back
tears, Mindy Rosen, of Cherry Hill, N.J., told the committee what
her 17-year-old son said Thursday morning as she kissed him goodbye
before leaving for the meeting: ``Mom, please tell them I want to
have gene therapy. I hate being sick.''

FOR THE BROTHERHOOD, NO CHOICE BUT TO CARRY ON

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Long after the flow of official words ran dry
Thursday, long after the last strains of ``Taps'' melted into the
rafters, thousands of firefighters found themselves drawn to the
place they know best: the nearest firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   They ate homemade American chop suey off paper plates. They
drank Pepsi from the can. And some of the more curious drifted
upstairs and gazed across the vast, communal bedroom that
firefighters Paul Brotherton and Jeremiah Lucey used to call home.
</P>
<P>
   It's nt much to look at, really, with its scratched linoleum
floors, fded bege wallpaper, and long rows of twin metal beds. But
it explains something more.
</P>
<P>
   It explains this concept of brotherhood so frequently mentioned
in this city these last tortuous days. It explains the sea of tears
shed by brawny men. It explains why upwards of 30,000 firefighters
from across the country and around the world arrived to pay final
respects to six men they didn't know. ``It's like family,'' Jay
Olson, a lieutenant from Portland, Ore., was saying of the men in
his company. ``You prepare meals together. You eat at the same
table. You're sleeping in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know everything about everyone else's business,'' he
added. ``The gifts they're buying for Christmas, their marital
problems, their kids' grades at school. The outside world, they
don't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 17 had their fathers taken away in last Friday's fire. A
city mourns. And an entire profession is once again brought to its
collective knee.
</P>
<P>
   The last heroes, firefighters are often called. They may well be
that and more. In a nation obsessed with every blip in interest
rates, at a time in our history when courage is seen as a $10
million-a-year outfielder playing with a sore shoulder.
firefighters provide a link to a more purposeful, more glorious
past.
</P>
<P>
   They are a different breed. They work in long shifts that often
extend through the night. They rush into burning buildings for
$50,000 a year. They pass their jobs from father to son. And
precious few of them ever leave to do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So six of them die in Worcester, and countless thousands of
their brethren put themselves in their emmpty boots.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bill Fuller of Ashland, Mass., who sat inside the Worcester
Centrum Thursday to pay tribute to the fallen six. His grandfather
was a firefigther. His father was a firefighter. He retired as a
firefighter two years ago. And his son is a firefighter now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave your wife and kids every day and go spend your time
with your second family,'' he said. ``It's in the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   They are bitten early by the g. They see the gleaming firetruck
scream down their streets. They watch as tough men in rubbery
uniforms transcend fear. They are seduced by the phscal, aggressive
nature of the work.
</P>
<P>
   They develop, quite literally, a blind trust in each other's
abilities. They trundle into smokey buildings in pairs, unable to
see more than a foot ahead. They eat each other's cooking, watch
ballgames together on threadbare chairs. They share bathrooms,
lockers, and beds.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the Centrum, Lieutenant David McCourt recalled
falling through a weakened floor a few years back in a house fire
in his native Medford, Mass. He clung to a wooden beam above a
swirl of flames until another firefighter came by and pulled him
up.
</P>
<P>
   That other firefighter was his father. ``He told me not to ever
let that happen again,'' McCourt said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stationhouse, they form bonds that even the hottest
flames can't burn away. They talk, they joke, they pull pranks. The
universal rule of firefighters: Never, ever, let your brethren know
what bothers you, or you'll live with it for the rest of your
career.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter Henry Cullen of North Providence, R.I. recalls a
particularly fastidious lieutenant who demanded once too often that
the firehouse be cleaned. So his troops hid a vacuum cleaner under
his bed and strung a series of extension cords along the wall. When
they turned it on at 4 a.m., a whole group of men were there to
watch their fearless leader bolt from his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks the monotony,'' said Cullen. ``Sometimes 't
stop moving for 20 hours, but sometimes you don't move at all for
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Another North Providence firefiter bragged too much about the
gas mileage of his new car, so his colleagues began covertly adding
fuel to his tank while he was keeping track of his miles. A couple
of weeks later, they began siphoning gas out and listened
sympathetically as he expressed confusion about his falling
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   How many beds have been moved to the roof? How many buckets of
water dumped on each other? How many foul casseroles hanged in
effigy from a kitchen pipe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this 21 years and I see new and amazing things
every day,'' said Mark Simmons, a battalion chief from Tempe, Ariz.
``You do everything you can to humiliate and annoy and haze
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the scene of a fire, there are no jokes. The often ragtag
collection of men _ and he rare woman _ suddenly become symphonic
in their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a guy on the hydrant, you have an apparatus guy, you
have someone else on the hose,'' said Rick Woerth, another
firefighter from Tempe, Ariz. ``And the captain is the quarterback,
running the play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like that last Friday evening at the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co. Firefighters entered the burning building
in pairs, and they died in pairs. As six of them were missing in
treacheous flames and smoke, their brethren had to be restrained
from plunging in anew.
</P>
<P>
   It's different than it used to be. The equipment is better these
days, more sophisticated. But because of that, firemen tend to take
greater risks. Buildings are more laden with sythetic materials,
which tend to burn hotter and faster than wood.
</P>
<P>
   And death lurks every night on every call, in places where they
least suspect it. Places like vacant arehouses.
</P>
<P>
   So now, firefighter at two stations here will eventually have to
clean out the lockers of the dead _ Lucey and Brotherton, Thomas
Spencer, James Lyons, Timothy Jackson and Joseph McGuirk.
</P>
<P>
   They'll fold their sheets. They'll walk uneasily past their
favorite easy chairs in the station lounge. They'll mourn the
casseroles that won't be baked, the pranks that will never be
plotted, the half-cocked dreams left unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, the survivors, this city, and the entire
profession will summon the strength to carry on. For firefighters
and their families, too often there is no choice.

 &HT;    Bush scoffs at recent poll result
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush responded Thursday to a
poll showing him trailing Arizona Sen. John McCain in New
Hampshire, while McCain expressed support for a threatened lawsuit
against the New York State Republican Party seeking to get him on
that state's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the most recent poll has him wondering if he'll lose
the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, Bush, campaigning in the state,
laughed and said: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are polls,'' he said at a morning news conference.
``There was one that showed me plus 14. There was one that showed
me even, plus five, minus whatever you just said. People are making
up their minds. That's what this is all about. And I've got a lot
of work to do, and I'm looking forward to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   An American Research Group poll released Wednesday found McCain
leading Bush for the first time here. McCain was ahead 37 percent
to Bush's 30 percent. That further solidified reports of McCain's
steady rise in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded to reporters' questions on the second of a
two-day spin through the state. On Wednesday, campaigning with
Netscape founder Jim Barksdale and Jesse Devitte, former state
chairman for Elizabeth Dole and chairman of the Software
Association of New Hampshire, Bush spoke to employees at a Nashua
software company, held a town meeting in Bedford and, later, had a
``high-tech town meeting'' at FIRST, a Manchester nonprofit
organization that works with children on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bush concluded his visit in Goffstown, where he received the
endorsement of more than 80 law enforcement officers and took a
walk down the town's quaint main street before boarding his
campaign bus and heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to analyze McCain's rise, Bush attributed it to the
vagaries of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people of New Hampshire take a good, hard look at
who they want to see as their president, and that's what's taking
place,'' Bush said. ... That's what elections are all about. I look
forward to the contest. John McCain's a good man. I just think I'll
do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Thursday, McCain joined former Bush supporter and
State Island Borough President Guy Molinari, who announced he will
sue the New York State Republican Party in an effort to get McCain
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, who earlier switched his support from Bush to McCain,
said the state GOP makes it too hard for candidates to win a place
on that state's ballot. GOP candidates must gather signatures in
all 31 congressional districts, among other rules that Molinari
called unconstitutional, because, he said, they place an ``undue
and overwhelming burden'' on presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has campaigned aggressively in New Hampshire and is
familiar to voters here while Bush has faced criticism for skipping
a handful of GOP forums and not working hard enough to win support.
This week, Bush said over and over again that he enjoys the
hand-shaking, the ``retail politics,'' of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   That went only so far with people like Liz Vincent, who heard
Bush speak in Manchester Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I tell you, the verdict's still out,'' she said. ``When
you listen to (Bush) talk, it's , `This is the way we do it in
Texas.' I tell you, I don't want New Hampshire to become Texas.''

PRESIDENT LEADS MOURNING OF SIX WHO DIED IN FLAMING WAREHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. -- Amid a sea of white-gloved hands saluting in
unison and the mournful strains of bagpipes, President Clinton told
those honoring Worcester's six fallen firefighters Thursday: ``Your
tragedy is ours. Your men are ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters killed answering their last alarm _ Paul
Brotherton, Jeremiah Lucey, Thomas Spencer, Timothy Jackson, James
Lyons and Joseph McGuirk _ ``embodied the best of our nation,''
Clinton said, speaking at the end of a stirring, two-hour tribute
attended by at least 15,000 people at the Worcester Centrum
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from as far away as Hawaii and Ireland streamed
into the Worcester Centrum beginning at 9 a.m. As many as 50,000
people stood outside the arena and lined the streets of a
three-mile procession before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words have a poor power to alleviate the pain you feel now,''
Clinton said. ``But as you look around this vast hall adnw that
there are thousnds and tousands more standing outside and other
places, we hope that by our collective presence we will speak
louder than words in saying that your tragedy is ours. Your men are
ours. Our whole country honors them and you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton spoke, a lone state trooper played taps on a
glimmering silver trumpet. A firefighter's wife wiped tears from
her eyes, clutching the compact triangle of an American flag that
flew over the Capitol on Dec. 3, the night of the fire. One of her
three now fatherless boys clung to her side.
</P>
<P>
   The young men were among 17 left without a father after the six
men perished in the five-alarm blaze inside the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co., a vacant five-story building that dates
to the turn of the century. Two bodies have been recovered but four
remain buried in the charred rubble. Authorities believe that a
homeless couple living in the building accidentally ignited the
blaze with a candle.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the firefighters were trapped looking for homeless people
during the blaze at a Franklin Street warehouse last Friday, and
four others died trying to rescue those colleagues. The search for
remains continued Thursday in the smoldering rubble.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, fellow firefighters, clergy and a staggering
array of political leaders rose from the slate-gray stage, lined
with six yellow helmets and bright flowers, to praise men who
matched Worcester Mayor Raymond Mariano's definition of a hero:
``An average citizen who does something extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the speakers tried to capture the depth of the
firefighters' actions last Friday everyday men plunging into an
inferno to save total strangers, then plunging in again to try to
rescue their own.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci likened the ``uncommon courage and
selflessness'' of the firefighters to the veterans who fought in
World War II. ``They were courageous not because they did not feel
fear, but because they were willing to fight fear on behalf of
others,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, in a reference to the loss of family
members in his lifetime, said ``I know how hard it is, how much you
yearn to reach out and touch the living memories you can see so
clearly before your eyes _ the smiles, the warmth, the Sunday
dinners, the last movie you watched together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that loved ones did not have to die too young. I wish
that tragedy never haunted a single soul. But I klnow that
sometimes life breaks your heart, and I believ we best honor those
who have been lost. . .when we pledge that they will always be in
our hearts, and their example will never die.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Raffa, president of the Worcester Fire Fighters Local
1099, said his colleagues showed no hesitation entering the
building looking for homeless people believed to be inside, and
that ``when two of our brothers called Mayday, four more of our
brother Worcester firefighters went into that inferno, again,
without hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice choking with emotion, Raffa pledged that ``we will not
leave that scene, we will not rest until we bring our brothers
home. Onythen can we have closure to this terrible tragedy. God
Bless Jerry and Paul, Tim and Tom, Jay and Joe and their loved
ones.''

   Alfred K. Whitehead, president of the International Association
of Fire Fighters, said the Worcester firefighters shared a bond
that led them to rescue efforts without hesitation. ``They were
engaged in an endeavor that is a measure of human greatness,'' he
said. ``They made a difference in this world because they died
doing something that mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the firefighters killed in the line of duty, who
ranged in age from 34 to 51, were presented with the International
Association of Fire Fighters' Martin E. Pierce Memorial Medal,
named for the father of the current Boston Fire Commissioner. The
elder Pierce had been a pioneer in promoting benefits for the
families left behind by firefighters who died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman James P. McGovern noted the courage of the
firefighters, their relatives, and their entire community. He said
the spirit of Worcester had been demonstrated in ``a thousand cups
of coffee, a thousand encouraging words; a thousand strong
shoulders to lean on, a thousand prayers. Thank you for showing the
world what I have always known.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was crystal clear and pleasantly chilly, cold enough to
turn breath into puffs of mist in the early morning. The normal
rules of life in and around Worcester were suspended _ schools and
businesses closed, streets kept clear, parking garages free.
Motorists, many of them with their headlights on in honor of the
firefighters, were waved through the tolls off the Massachusetts
Turnpike leading to h city.
</P>
<P>
   The processional started at 9:20 and was still going when the
memorial service, delayed as the firefighters filed into the hall,
began at 11:20.
</P>
<P>
   The pageantry of mourning was all around, inside and outside the
Centrum. Black ribbons were attached to lapels, spraypainted sheets
hung on overpasses praising the ``fallen heroes,'' and tributes
were spelled out in black plastic letters on roadside signs
normally used to announce holiday shopping sales.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum estimate of firefighters who converged on Worcester
Thursday was 30,000. The total number of people either attending
the service, standing outside the Centrum or lining the procession
route was estimated by some fficials to be as high as 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 members of the Worcester Fire Department were given the
day off, though many chose not to attend the service, instead
opting to remain at the warehouse site, which is being referred to
as ``sacred ground.'' Large-screen televisions were set up at the
site broadcasting the service.
</P>
<P>
   The crane being used to knock down a wall of the gutted building
was switched off during the service but started up again as soon as
the ceremony ended. Firefighters walked from the Centrum to the
still-smoldering ruins and were joined there by Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Gore attended the service, though only Clinton
spoke. It is common for the White House to be represented at a
service for victims of a tragedy, but it is unusual for both the
president and vice president to attend together.
</P>
<P>
   The two met privately with the families of the firefighters
before the service, consolg them and listening to their stories of
their lost loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Grouped in six clusters, the family members watched local TV
coverage of the procession of thousands of firefighters making
their somber trek to the sports arena for the service. Guided by
Raffa, Clinton and Gore moved separately from family to family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more smiles and remembrances than tears,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said after the meeting. ``We
told them how important their services were, how sorry he is for
their loss, and how proud the country is of their fathers,
brothers, spouses and all the other fire fighter who serve in the
way that hey do.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the Middle East, negotiations come and
negotiations go and everyone has learned to be guarded, even jaded,
about the possibilities for agreements, much less real peace.
</P>
<P>
   But a feeling that change was imminent swept through Israel on
Thursday following President Clinton's surprise announcement that
Israeli-Syrian talks would be resumed next week after nearly four
years. Almost palpably, the national pulse seemed to quicken _ for
some with elation, for others with anxiety. Even the Israeli
right-wing, so quiet these last few months, girded up for its first
real combat.
</P>
<P>
   Why did everyone get ahead of themselves? Supporters and
opponents alike talked as if the resumption of negotiations, which
are bound to be difficult and crisis-ridden, was tantamount to an
agreement. Many were already asking whether voters would approve
the accord in a referendum and whether Syria would get American
financing to modernize its old Soviet-equipped army.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because there is a deep-seated sense that the
stars are aligned for a deal to be realized. All three leaders _
President Clinton, President Hafez el-Assad of Syria and Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel _ are hungry for a success,
determined to prove that they can resolve this 32-year-old conflict
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we have this time is not artificial deadlines,
but real ones,'' said Stephen P. Cohen, the senior policy adviser
of the Center for Middle East Peace in New York. ``There is the
deadline of biology and the deadline of the decline of political
power, or its potential, for the three principals.''
</P>
<P>
   For Assad, this year in which two important Arab leaders of his
generation have died _ King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of
Morocco _ has been a reminder of the physical limits of power. The
69-year-old Syrian is believed to be in ill health, plagued by
chronic and debilitating disorders including diabetes and, it is
thought, some form of cancer. To retrieve the Golan Heights, the
strategic plateau he lost to Israel in the 1967 war, would close a
circle and provide neat borders to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Also, experts on Syria believe that Assad wants to ensure that
the reins of power will be smoothly handed to his son Bashar, 34,
and that to accomplish this he needs to consolidate his own
position. By taking on peace with Israel, the major issue facing
Syria, Assad seeks to prove that he is willing to finish something
that he started eight years ago at a conference in Madrid. To walk
away from the table this time, without the Golan Heights, would be
seen as a defeat and would undercut his authority at a critical
time. Like the Israelis, after so much talk, the Syrians are
impatient to see results.
</P>
<P>
   And from a Syrian point of view, Barak is an attractive
negotiating partner; he grounds his concept of peace in a view of
Israeli national security and does not stress economic
normalization, an idea that reportedly frightens Assad. That the
Syrians are willing to send their foreign minister, Farouk Shara,
to meet directly with Barak increases both the public risk they are
taking and the prospects of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was lacking until now was the political will on both
sides to come to closure,'' said Itamar Rabinovich, president of
Tel Aviv University, who previously headed Israel's negotiations
with Syria. ``A lot of the basic work has already been done. There
is a legacy to the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Syrians and the Israelis realize that they can only be
guaranteed of Washington's focused support in the immediate future,
before the American presidential campaign moves into full drive. In
Washington, Clinton clearly wants to secure a major accomplishment
in a region where he has invested so much energy, and time is
running out.
</P>
<P>
   Barak feels time to be of the essence, too. He is a great
believer in momentum, which is why he set a peace deadline for
himself shortly after taking office in July. In 15 months, he said,
more or less, he would achieve peace with the Palestinians, peace
with the Syrians and withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
His targets set the agenda for the region, pressuring the other
leaders to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak also faced political fall-out at home, too, when his
peacemaking did not take off as quickly as he originally planned.
He was encountering his first real disenchantment at home as
anxieties rose that he would not be able to live up to his
diplomatic ambitions. But with the announcement that talks would
resume, his political profile changed almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until last night, Ehud Barak was a prime minister under
siege,'' wrote Yossi Verter in Thursday's Haaretz newspaper. ``But
last night was a long time ago, before Hafez Assad enlisted to help
him. The sudden breakthrough in negotiations with Syria restored
the color to Barak's wan cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the first handshake between high-level Israeli and
Syrian officials is bound to produce a ripple throughout the Middle
East, a sense that the defining tensions are starting to shift.
Barak declared on Thursday that everything can be sewn up quickly,
within a few months. His certainty set the tone, and encouraged
Israelis to leap far forward in their thinking. With remarkable
precision, Channel Two television on Thursday night predicted a 58
to 41 Parliament approval of the eventual agreement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the detailed negotiations that follow are bound to be
tortuous. They will take place in the region, possibly in Amman,
Jordan's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In concept, the Israelis and the Syrians would seem to be close
at the outset. Like other leaders before him, Barak is prepared to
concede the Golan Heights in exchange for security guarantees and
greater normalization of relations. But the border lines are key.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis will propose withdrawing to borders agreed to
internationally in 1923. The Syrians have insisted on the borders
of June 4, 1967, before the Golan Heights were occupied by Israel,
which would give Syria access to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is a few miles, and for Americans, with their
expansive continent, it seems pathetic,'' Rabinovich said. ``But
this is the proverbial olive tree. For the Syrians, to be or not to
be on the water's edge is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are likely to urge the Syrian leaders to engage in
a kind of public diplomacy they may not be prepared to undertake.
That would mean sending clear messages to their people that Israel
is no longer the enemy, and making sure that Israel's northern
border is free of violence as Israeli troops began to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, born at Camp David 20 years ago
with a framework agreement between former Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and the late President Anwar Sadat, will shadow the talks.
The Syrians will push to extend beyond the international borders
just as the Egyptians pushed for getting Taba in addition to the
Sinai. If the Israelis insist on maintaining a presence in an early
warning station on Mount Hermon, the Syrians are likely to point
out that they completely exited the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad cannot do a worse deal than Sadat,'' said Dore Gold,
Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations. ``He has to try
to do a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise his people will say, ``Why did you wait 20 years?''

UNION QUESTIONS INVESTIGATOR'S FINDING ON TEACHER CHEATING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City teachers' union Thursday called an
investigator's finding that dozens of teachers had helped students
cheat on standardized tests exaggerated and unfair, and officials
at the Board of Education suggested that the report was aimed at
undercutting Chancellor Rudy Crew while his future is being
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the United Federation of Teachers said the report
unfairly implied that cheating was rampant in the city's 1,100
schools, and they asserted that some of the 43 teachers charged
with cheating appeared to have been wrongly accused. At a news
conference, Randi Weingarten, the union's president, announced that
the union had hired its own investigators to study the report's
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education officials stoked the debate by questioning
why Edward F. Stancik, the special investigator for New York City
schools, released the scathing report in the weeks before Crew and
the Board of Education must decide on whether to extend his
contract. One official even called a reporter to point out that
Stancik had briefed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's staff on the report,
before publicly releasing it, but had not informed Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Some allies of the chancellor theorized privately that Giuliani,
who stopped expressing confidence in Crew after the two men battled
over school vouchers last spring, had directed Stancik to release
the unflattering report now in hopes of convincing Crew to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions have been raised about the timing of this,'' said
Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Crew. ``The chancellor, though,
assumes there was no premeditated decision on when to release this
report.''
</P>
<P>
   Stancik and aides to Giuliani angrily insisted Thursday that
City Hall never interfered in Stancik's investigations of the
school system. Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota confirmed that Stancik had
briefed mayoral aides on the report before publicly releasing it
but added that Stancik frequently did so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling that anyone would say this report was timed
to hurt Rudy Crew,'' Lhota said. ``Nothing could be further from
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a morning news conference, Ms. Weingarten said she had hired
the corporate investigations company of Thacher Associates to look
into the cheating allegations and recommend strategies to prevent
cheating in the future. Ms. Weingarten said that while some cases
described appeared to be ``clear instances of conspiracy and
fraud,'' others were questionable.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ms. Weingarten said, she had doubts about the
charges that students were given practice tests with actual answers
from the impending tests on them. Students frequently take practice
tests modeled after the official exams, she said. She said she was
also concerned about a number of charges based solely on interviews
with young students, including some cases in which teachers
interviewed by the investigators had disputed the children's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children's allegations make up the body of the report, and
the denials are buried in the footnotes,'' Ms. Weingarten
complained. ``I don't want to trample on children, but there is a
sweeping indictment here of the entire system that we don't think
is borne out by the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that some teachers had been calling the union
headquarters ``in tears'' to say they would ``never, never, never
in a million years resort to the practices described here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Ms. Weingarten stressed that she
abhorred cheating and said that if the charges proved correct, she
would consider them ``appalling'' and press for the culprits to be
punished. As the school system puts more emphasis on standardized
tests, she said, the Board of Education should develop strategies
and clear-cut protocols for administering the increasingly
high-stakes exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to not only get to the bottom of this,'' she said,
``but to create some solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Stancik said that the union had every right to
investigate the charges. But he added that he suspected that the
investigation would be biased on behalf of the accused teachers.
``Randi has made it very clear to me that she thinks highly of many
of the people named in the report, without having investigated it
at all,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Toby Thacher, who will lead the union's investigation, is the
former inspector general of the New York City School Construction
Authority. He left that job in 1996, after developing an
anti-corruption program that was praised by legal experts as a
national model. Thacher would not discuss how he planned to
investigate the report Thursday, but he said that he would present
any findings to the union. The union could then forward the
findings to the Board of Education, which must decide whether to
bring disciplinary charges against the accused teachers.
</P>
<P>
   William Thompson Jr., the board president, said Thursday that he
took the charges seriously but that he believed that ``the vast
majority of our teachers and supervisors do not engage in
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani vigorously defended the report at his daily news
conference, going so far as to call Stancik ``one of the most
effective investigators ever in the history of the city.'' In
discussing the findings, he did not offer any support for Crew.
Instead, Giuliani said that the school system ``doesn't work'' and
that he should be in charge of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board of Education system doesn't work to serve children
well,'' Giuliani said. ``So you have to change the system.''

 &HT;    10 steps to e-mail sobriety

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ E-mail addicts: The first step is admitting you
have a problem. After that, follow this 10-step program. It
probably won't break you from e-mail, but it will give you a little
breathing room to last well into the next millennium:
</P>
<P>
   1.Try getting away from e-mail just one day a week. Sunday is a
good time to start.
</P>
<P>

you. Let your e-mail program respond with an automated message
while you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   3.Spring clean your e-mail: Trash all those outdated folders,
respond to any lingering threads and feel good about your tidier
``inbox.''
</P>
<P>
   4.Unless your job depends on it, don't leave your e-mail open
all day. Check it once every hour or two, then close it and get
back to your work or play.
</P>
<P>
   5.Take a weekend drive or a hike and get as far away from your
mailbox as possible.
</P>
<P>
   6.Forgive all those who have sent you spam and hokey e-mail in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   7.Resolve to send no spam or hokey
</P>
<P>
   e-mail if you can help it.
</P>
<P>
   8.Stop giving your e-mail address to people you never want to
hear from.
</P>
<P>
   9.When in doubt, face-to-face communication is best.
</P>
<P>
   10.Accept the higher power of your e-mail administrator.

   Gretchen,
</P>
<P>
   Finishing up the story on e-mail addiction. What I'm finding out
from the people who've responded is that a lot of people use e-mail
so much that they aren't able to differentiate their work life from
their home life. I'm forwarding some of the messages so you can see
them _ one person, a systems administrator, says he checks his
e-mail and responds nearly 24 hours a day depending on his work
schedule. I also received some information from an Austin company
that specializes in Web-based
</P>
<P>
   e-mail. They had some interesting things to say and some
research to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   I got your messages about WeeWeb and Link. I'll fix those as
soon as I get a chance to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Does it seem weird to you that we're

<P>
   e-mailing back and forth like this when you sit less than 10
feet away?
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll e-mail you as soon as the story's done.

   I can relate. My clients no longer call me to tell me something
important _ they e-mail me. If I don't check my e-mail at least
three to four times every HOUR, I miss something. And it's usually
very urgent and very important. Honestly, the rhythm of our day has
drastically changed.
</P>
<P>
   I feel like I'm in a William Gibson novel gone Similacra. When I
unplug at 6 or 7 p.m., I still sneak looks at the e-mail to make

Thank you 24/7. Now where's my life?

</P>
<P>
   The Web, with its sparkly new ways of selling you things, is not
the biggest entanglement in this happy high-tech life. It is the
591 billion e-mail messages folks in the U.S. will send this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think our growing obsession with e-mail has to do
with volume, the real change is not only how much we're using
e-mail, but how we're using it. Genevieve Van Cleve, who works for
HushMail, an Austin company that provides encrypted e-mail service
on the Web, said she uses e-mail to avoid the nagging call of a
ringing phone. ``To screen calls openly is kind of rude; to choose
to answer or not answer e-mail provides a bit more privacy to the
user and recipient,'' Van Cleve said. ``I don't quite know if I'm
convinced myself, but I like typing instead of getting stuck
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steven Phenix, who works for WorldNet Box Office Inc.,
confides _ via e-mail _ that his girlfriend won't let him have
e-mail at home because she knows he will check it constantly. ``I
only live seven blocks from work. So on weekends, I sneak up to the
office before she wakes up. In the evenings, if I run to the store
for milk, I can't resist dropping by the office to log on.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cleve and Phenix, e-mail may be essential for their jobs in
marketing and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   But their lives, full of unanswered e-mails, online address
books and subject headers where once there were stamps and licked
envelopes, are becoming more typical.
</P>
<P>
   There are 95 million e-mail users in the U.S., according to
Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research Inc. About 97 percent of
people who go online use it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those numbers is a culture where computers have
successfully infiltrated the home and new e-mail enabled appliances
_ everything from smart cell phones to e-mail-friendly toys like
the Sega Dreamcast to the past and future incarnations of the Palm
Pilot organizer _ will be able to say ``you've got mail,'' (not out
loud _ this still isn't AOL) whether you're in front of the TV, in
the car or (Bill Gates save us) using the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The result is people who run and run and run like the Energizer
Bunny with no ``OFF'' switch. Like the highly touted new high-speed
Internet services, we are always ``ON,'' checking e-mail again and
again, whether it's the crucial information for a business proposal
or an e-mail with an attachment of your best friend's ultrasound
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   We live and GET MAIL and GET MAIL again until we sleep.
</P>
<P>
   And then: ``On several occasions I have had dreams in e-mail,''
Phenix said. ``While I'm sleeping, a little icon pops into my head
that chimes, 'You have dreams!' I click on the icon and the dream
begins.''

   Matthew Landt, who works for IBM, but who makes it clear his

</P>
<P>
   Lou Marco, a system administrator at Jump.Net, who says he gets
at least 500 e-mails a day: ``Except for the four hours of actual
sleep I get each night, I check e-mail constantly at work (always
an open window) and every 5-10 minutes at home (on a dedicated
connection). ``
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tosch, a manufacturing supervisor at Solectron Texas who
says he spends at least two hours a day on e-mail: ``I check it 20
times a day. It's probably more, but I'd deny it. I get 50-120
personal messages and about 60 work-related messages a day. It's
vital to work and seemingly vital to my personal life.''

   Gretchen,
</P>
<P>
   I called a psychiatrist, a woman named Jan Parker who has a
doctorate and teaches at National University's La Jolla, Calif.,
campus. It was a little strange speaking to her on the phone. I've
gotten very used to asking questions over e-mail. It was an
adjustment speaking to a live voice.
</P>
<P>
   She said that there hasn't been much published research on
e-mail addiction. But she said there is anecdotal evidence that
overuse of the Internet can strain relationships and, of course,
take time away from other activities.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting thing she said _ e-mail is one of those perfect
things that can feed into obsessive compulsive behavior pretty
easily.
</P>
<P>
   For people who already have those personality traits, ``This is
a really convenient one for them to get that way about.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said another group of people (and who among us falls into
this one?) have an unmet need for contact. I imagine there's a
whole population of tech workers who use e-mail to combat
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``They're the kind of people that wear out their
friends and call people all the time if they have a problem. Now
they can do it this way and it's not as obvious. They're less
likely to get rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered aloud to her what might happen if people who rely on
e-mail for that fulfillment don't get what they need. ``The
function of e-mail is so the person feels connected,'' she
answered. ``Anything that threatens that sense of being connected
is going to produce anxiety.''
</P>

   Write back as soon as you get this. I need to know what you
think.

   Gretchen,
</P>
<P>
   The story is just about done. It's hard to draw conclusions
about e-mail addiction because really, where do we draw the line
between addiction, compulsion and enthusiastic use?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone I talked to who uses the Internet said that e-mail is
important, and vital to them at least in their work. And many of
them bemoan the fact that they get so many e-mails, including
useless spam. But most of them agree that with a little patience,
you can control how much you let it take over your life.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to check your e-mail every two minutes, then
don't. If you can't respond to all of your messages at once, put
them aside and devote a half hour later in the day to
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   If you rely on e-mail for your happiness, you probably need to
reexamine your priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, I counted how many times I checked my e-mail, from
the time I woke up to bedtime. I checked about 47 times.
</P>

   I think I may follow some of the helpful, solicited advice.

   I think we all could do that.

STATE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES SERBS KILLED 10,000 KOSOVAR ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department estimated Thursday that 10,000
Kosovar Albanians were killed this year in the Serbian campaign to
force out the Albanian population from its homeland, a figure
nearly five times larger than the number of bodies unearthed from
mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the toll from the so-called ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo, the department also said that 1.5 million Albanians had
been expelled from their homes and that more than 2,000 Albanians
were in custody in Serbian detention camps.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of deaths is broadly in line with those provided by
newspaper accounts and in recent months by human rights groups and
the United Nations, as well as by NATO, which directed the air
strikes that led to a pullout of Serbian forces from Kosovo in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Some Balkan experts and others sympathetic to the Serbs have
described the estimates as exaggerated, noting that investigators
of war crimes had exhumed 2,108 bodies. Whatever the final toll, it
seems sure to be far lower than some estimates offered during the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials defended their estimate Thursday by
noting that Serbian forces were known to have burned or otherwise
destroyed the bodies of many Albanian victims and that many grave
sites would not be investigated until the spring, when the ground
thaws. Investigators said they believed that they would uncover
thousands of additional bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts by Serbian forces to destroy evidence of their
crimes in Kosovo in 1999 came as no surprise to us,'' the chief war
crimes investigator in the department, David J. Scheffer, said.
Scheffer criticized those he called ``revisionists,'' who have
suggested that the toll was much lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases,'' he said at a news conference where the report
was released, ``the victims' bodies were burned near where they
died. In other cases, the burning, destruction or reburial occurred
on a wholesale scale, with bodies being shipped by truck. All this
tells us that we will never know the full extent of Kosovar
Albanian victims of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the estimate of 10,000 deaths was based on
recent reports from war crimes investigators, interviews with
refugees and evidence from intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, prosecutors for the international war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague said that 2,108
bodies had been found at 195 sites in Kosovo before work stopped
for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report noted that the International
Committee for the Red Cross had provided the figure of 2,000
Albanians in detention camps. Many detained Albanians are widely
believed to be former prisoners in Serbian-run jails in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report offered a catalog of other atrocities carried out by
Serbs against the majority Albanian population in Kosovo, including
what it described as the systemic rape of Albanian women by Serbian
troops, paramilitaries and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death represents only one facet of Serbian actions in
Kosovo,'' the report said, adding that rape was probably much more
common than had been reported ``because of the stigma attached to
the survivors in traditional Kosovar Albanian society.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Serbia's military pullout from Kosovo, the
report found, 200 to 400 Kosovar Serbs had been killed, apparently
in retaliation, and thousands of Serbian homes had been looted,
burned or destroyed. The report cited the Serbian Orthodox Church
as reporting that more than 40 churches and monasteries had been
destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   On his visit to Kosovo last month, President Clinton implored
the majority Albanians to forgive the Serbs who remained and to end
the revenge attacks. The remarks were received with little
enthusiasm by many Albanian leaders, who said it would be difficult
for Serbs to remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe reported that revenge-inspired violence against Kosovar
Serbs had grown worse since the arrival of NATO troops. The report
made clear that the attacks often occurred under the nose of the
troops, a contention that NATO has denied.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An American company that provides space services to
NASA has reached an agreement for a Russian company to build and
place on the International Space Station a new segment totally
devoted to commercial projects.
</P>
<P>
   The American concern, Spacehab Inc., is to announce on Friday
that it will provide some of the financing for RSC Energia, a
Russian space hardware company, to build a pressurized module that
is to be attached to the Russian part of the international station
to serve business customers.
</P>
<P>
   The module, named Enterprise, will be used for
industry-sponsored experiments and manufacturing and will serve as
a base for providing commercial broadcasting and Internet services
from space, Spacehab officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimated that it would cost $100 million to develop
and test the module and its commercial communications system.
</P>
<P>
   David Rossi, Spacehab's president, said the company would
provide $50 million in cash and would ensure that its Russian
partners had the money needed to complete their obligations,
perhaps in the form of loan guarantees. Under the agreement, Rossi
said, the module will be jointly owned by Spacehab and Energia,
with the possibility that Russia's national space agency would also
become a part owner.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 billion space station, being built in segments 250 miles
above Earth, is to be a giant laboratory weighing almost a million
pounds when it is finished in 2004. The project, led by the United
States, is a concerted effort of 16 countries, including Russia,
Japan, Canada, Brazil and 11 nations of the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other partners in the station have said
they eventually want some of it, or all, to be commercialized so as
to help produce a return on the investment. The newly announced
segment, Spacehab officials said, will be the first major step in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first commercial module on the space station,
and it will open a new era in space commerce,'' said Shelley
Harrison, chairman of Spacehab, a publicly traded company based in
Washington, which owns and leases out pressurized modules flown on
the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Smith, a space policy analyst with the Congressional
Research Service, said the Spacehab initiative was ``a daring
gamble'' to make space commercialization practical. Ms. Smith said
the effort faced many hurdles, among them the question whether the
cash-short Russians could come up with their share of the money
needed to build, test and launch the module.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that adding this new module to the space station
would require using some of the power, crew time and other
resources of the outpost. Those resources are limited, and use of
them will mean a need to reach agreements with the station's other
partners, who have yet to see details of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spacehab is taking the first bold step toward space station
commercialization, which many people have talked about but no one
has done before,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   John Schumacher, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's associate director for international relations,
called the Spacehab project ``an exciting development'' that still
had to be worked out in detail to see how the module would fit on
the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always encouraged commercial interests on the station,''
Schumacher said, ``and want to see how they will meet the
requirements to be included.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher said the space station's partners had signed
agreements on how additions could be made to it _ where new mass
could be added, for instance, and how much electrical power would
be available. He noted that the Russians were already committed to
providing two experimental modules for the station, and said the
commercial module might fulfill the requirement for one of them if
the Russian space agency was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' he said, ``we know very little about the
Spacehab-Energia proposal and look forward to seeing the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison of Spacehab said the proposed module would be similar
to others on the station. It would be a pressurized cylinder 36
feet long and 12 feet in diameter weighing 15,000 to 20,000 pounds,
and would have attachment points on its exterior for instruments or
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The module would not have solar power panels, Spacehab officials
said, because it would be located at the bottom of the station,
blocked from direct sunlight. But the company is considering the
addition of some kind of fuel cells, devices that produce
electricity through chemical reactions, /at some point after
launching, to provide power beyond that drawn from the station's
grid.
</P>
<P>
   Spacehab officials said that in addition to renting out
commercial research space, they hoped to make money by using their
module for space science education projects involving schools
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company also hopes to use the communications equipment for
commercial television and Internet broadcasts from space and
supported by advertisers. This will include newscasts,
entertainment programming, business commercials and other
advertising, and Internet content, possibly including games that
could be played in space from the ground, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The space station now consists of two segments, one American and
one Russian, launched late last year. While a dozen major
components await to be linked together in space, construction has
been on hold for a year because of Russia's inability to complete a
crucial third segment on time and delays in the U.S. space shuttle
program caused by electrical wiring problems. Flights to the
station are set to resume early next year.

 &HT;    Police arrest suspected pilferer of pork chops
 &HT;    By John Lynch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ A Pittsburg, Texas, man faces a felony theft
charge after he was accused of trying to smuggle 48 pork chops out
of a Longview supermarket, stashing them in his pants, according to
police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fitzgerald Cooper, 33, was nabbed after suspicious
employees at a Super 1 Foods saw him putting packages of meat into
his pants shortly after midnight Friday, according to arrest
reports. He was in the Gregg County Jail on Thursday on $2,500
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper spent some time in the store, the report said, wandering
around and picking up items, eventually paying for a bottle of
orange juice. When the store manager stopped him as he attempted to
leave, Cooper handed over three packages, containing 48 pork chops
and valued at $40, the report said. He then attempted to flee, but
was restrained by employees, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Cooper, who listed his employer as Pilgrims Pride
Corp. of Pittsburg, would have faced a Class C misdemeanor charge
for theft less than $50, but the charge was enhanced to a state
jail felony theft because of a previous conviction, the report
said. Cooper had an outstanding warrant for evading arrest in Camp
County, but the details of that incident weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   A state jail felony is punishable by 180 days to two years in a
state jail; a Class C misdemeanor carries a fine of less than $500.

   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ The Syrian government and its Arab allies
spoke with customary caution Thursday even as they welcomed the
planned resumption of peace talks between Syria and Israel. But
across the Arab world, there were also rare hints of haste to learn
whether the breakthrough might really bear real fruit.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon the powerful speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri,
reflected that enthusiasm by saying his government, too, was ready
to seize the opportunity for peace. Berri said Lebanese officials
would join their Syrian counterparts in discussions this month, as
soon as the talks with Israel move from an opening session next
week in Washington to further meetings in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Syria are the last of Israel's neighbors to remain
technically at war with Israel, and the prospect of three-way
negotiations could offer an opportunity for the final settlement
along their disputed borders, an accord that has eluded them for
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, which made its peace with Israel in 1994, described the
planned Syrian-Israeli talks as ``a step in the right direction''
and said it hoped Lebanese-Israeli talks would also begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, which has been at peace with Israel since the Camp
David accords of 1979, President Hosni Mubarak was described by a
top deputy as being ``very happy with the progress that has been
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, there were deep rumblings of concern
that a new international preoccupation with Syrian-Israeli issues
might allow Israel to relegate talks with the Palestinians to the
back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum must remain on the Palestinian-Israeli track,''
said Ayman Majali, a deputy prime minister of Jordan. Majali said
it was vital that the so-called final-status issues not be
neglected: future Israeli-Palestinian borders, the status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees. Arab governments
see these as being at once the most intractable and the most
important of the disputes that divide Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The location of any long-term Syrian-Israeli talks has not been
disclosed, but one candidate is Jordan, whose young monarch, King
Abdullah, served as a key intermediary earlier this year in passing
messages between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria Thursday morning, just hours after President Clinton
announced in Washington that Syria and Israel had agreed to renew
talks, government-controlled newspapers announced the news with
front-page headlines and prominent portraits of Clinton and
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an official statement issued late Wednesday in Damascus,
the newspapers reported that Assad and Clinton, in a telephone
conversation, had ``expressed their determination to exert all
possible efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   But newspaper commentaries, which reflect government opinion,
also cautioned Syrians against expecting too much from Israel,
which still occupies then Golan Heights, captured in battle in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intentions alone, regardless of how good they appear, do not a
peace make,'' the official newspaper Tishrin said in an editorial
that urged Israel and Prime Minister Ehud Barak to back up words
with action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the formula used by Clinton, Israel and Syria have agreed
only to resume negotiations ``from the point where they left off''
nearly four years ago. That careful phrasing is intended to
sidestep a dispute about whether Israel ever agreed, as Syria
claims, to a formula under which Israel would withdraw fully from
the Golan to the borders that existed before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   But the editorial in Tishrin suggested that Syria was still
unwilling to negotiate that point. Saying Syria ``will not give up
one iota of soil from the Golan,'' the newspaper declared, ``The
occupation must cease in all of the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, reports from the region made clear that Syrian officials
were moving into high gear in preparation for next week's talks, at
which Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara will meet with Barak in the
highest-level meeting yet between Syrian and Israeli delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Assad telephoned President Emile Lahud of Lebanon, while Shara
spoke with the Lebanese prime minister, Salim Hoss, apparently in
an attempt to coordinate positions. Syria, which maintains about
15,000 troops in Lebanon, is the dominant power there, and each
nation has said that neither will make peace with Israel alone.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon was not invited to the talks in Washington, but U.S.
officials have made plain their hope that Lebanese officials would
join later discussions. Thursday David Satterfield, the U.S.
ambassador to Lebanon, met with Lahud, Hoss and Berri to brief them
about next week's talks.

 McCAIN AND BRADLEY PLAN JOINT APPEARANCE   
(ART ADV: Photo NYT11 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain and Bill Bradley, both insurgent
candidates for president, have agreed to step across party lines
and stage an unusual joint appearance in New Hampshire to highlight
their support for overhauling the nation's campaign finance system,
aides to both candidates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican and the Democrat threatening their parties'
front-runners, disagree about how the current system should be
changed, both have put the fight against special interest money at
the center of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Each has taken a strong stand against the unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties known as soft money that were at the
center of the campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said they expect the two to make a joint pledge next week
that if they became their party's nominees, they would call on
their parties not to accept soft money.
</P>
<P>
   While still working on logistics and details, the two sides were
planning the appearance for next Thursday and were examining
whether it could take place in Claremont, N.H., where President
Clinton and then Speaker Newt Gingrich held a wide-ranging,
conciliatory debate at a senior citizens center in 1995, a few
months after the Republicans took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gingrich shook hands on a pledge to create a
commission to study an overhaul of the campaign finance and
lobbying laws. But the agreement soon dissolved in partisan
acrimony, making that handshake the symbol of the broken promise of
reform.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One official planning the event said the candidates might still
have to find another location in New Hampshire because advance
teams were not sure they could find a large enough site in
Claremont on such short notice. Scores of reporters packed into an
outdoor tent to cover the encounter between Clinton and Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The meeting could be officially announced as early as Friday.
``John McCain and Bill Bradley both want this to happen,'' said Dan
Schnur, McCain's communications director. ``So we are doing
everything we can to try to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold a joint appearance comes at a time when
McCain is beginning to pull ahead of Gov. George W. Bush in New
Hampshire according to new polls. Bradley, meanwhile, is running
neck and neck with Vice President Al Gore in the nation's first
primary state.
</P>
<P>
   The shared spotlight should provide both candidates with a burst
of publicity and serve to distinguish them further as fighters
against the status quo. It would also give each a bipartisan sheen
at a time when voters are turned off by partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley in particular a Thursday, Dec. 16, event could give
him maximum publicity and momentum going into a scheduled debate
against Gore the next day in Manchester, N.H. Gore is vulnerable on
the campaign finance issue because of his fund raising in 1996,
including one event at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   One question about a joint appearance is how it would sway
independent voters. Bradley and McCain are each trying to draw
support from independents in New Hampshire. But strategists for
each campaign say most independents already lean toward one party
or the other, creating little risk for the two in appearing
together. In New Hampshire independent voters can cast a ballot in
either party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of changing the finance law were ecstatic Thursday.
``We just haven't had two serious presidential candidates making
campaign finance reform a centerpiece of their campaigns before,''
said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit
group advocating change in the way campaigns are financed. ``Now
they're talking about creating a very dramatic symbolic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns have been sporadically discussing such an
event since last July, when Bradley called for a sweeping overhaul
of the campaign finance system including free television time for
candidates and public financing of congressional campaigns. He also
said, ``If I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party, the first thing
I'll do is invite the Republican nominee to join me in a compact.
We will direct our parties not to raise or spend soft money in the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Ludecke, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said Thursday: ``He
issued that challenge and an interesting thing happened. Tony
Coelho attacked him and John McCain accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, the campaign chairman to Vice President Al Gore said in
July that Gore too favored a change in the campaign finance law.
But he went on to say Bradley's stance would leave Democratic
candidates to ``fend for themselves while George W. Bush and the
Republican money machine try to buy the election.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCain, who is the main Republican sponsor of legislation to ban
soft money said, ``I welcome another voice to the fight to take our
government back from the special interests and big dollar
contributors.'' McCain shares with Bradley an interest in promoting
free television time, but he does not support public financing of
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Bradley's speech in July, the McCain
campaign approached the Bradley camp with the suggestion of a joint
re-enactment of the Claremont handshake _ this time with a pledge
against soft money. But negotiations were desultory.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to McCain said that the Bradley campaign became wary
of the idea when the former senator from New Jersey started rising
in the polls. Then the McCain campaign itself became distracted by
other issues, including questions raised about McCain's temper.
</P>
<P>
   Recently both sides started negotiating seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar, though far less showy and substantive moment
in recent presidential history came in 1980 when Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., who was challenging President Jimmy Carter made a
joint appearance on Capitol Hill with John B. Anderson, R-Ill., who
was mounting an independent candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were not promoting a particular issue, however.
Instead Anderson implied that he would consider withdrawing his
candidacy if Kennedy became the Democratic nominee instead of
Carter. Carter won the nomination, then lost to Ronald Reagan.
Anderson drew just 6.5 percent of the vote in his third party run.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet mania reached new levels of frenzy
Thursday as investors paid huge multiples on an initial public
offering, giving a market value of almost $10 billion to a tiny
company with powerful competitors, little revenue and no
expectation of earnings in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The company, VA Linux Systems of Sunnyvale, sells computers
powered by standard Intel Pentium processors that run on Linux, the
free Unix-based operating system created by a Finnish graduate
student and now marketed by more than a dozen companies worldwide.
The computers are designed as servers, computers that deliver
Internet products, like Web pages and e-mail, or other network
services.
</P>
<P>
   Though giants like Dell Computer and IBM already market Linux
servers of similar power, shares of VA Linux Systems surged more
than eight-fold Thursday, setting a record for an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 4.4 million shares, an 11 percent stake, priced
at $30 a share, raising $132 million. The shares opened at $30, and
closed at $250 in Nasdaq trading, giving the tiny company a market
valuation of $9.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for shares of companies that deal in Linux products
and services has been enormous this year, and those stocks shared
in Thursday's largess. Shares in Red Hat, a Linux distributor, have
soared 20-fold since the company went public Aug. 11 and rose $15
to $286.20 Thursday. Andover.Net, which runs a network of Web sites
devoted to Linux, has more than quadrupled since its initial
offering on Wednesday, gaining $14.125, to close at $77.50. Corel
Corp., which sells software that runs on the Linux system, most
notably a Linux version of its WordPerfect document creation
software, rose $10.9375, to $39.25, after trading as low as $2 in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux has never made money and does not expect to for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   As the company's prospectus points out: ``We do not expect to
generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability and,
therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses for at least
the foreseeable future. If we do achieve profitability, we may not
be able to sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said the stampeding market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stock like this is an obvious example of something going
through the roof with absolutely no underlying fundamentals,'' said
Michael C. Perkins, co-author of ``The Internet Bubble'' (Harper
Business, 1999). ``It starts with the institutions flipping the
stock, and then the momentum players and the day traders take over.
Just when you think you've seen the peak of the insanity, this is a
perfect bubble stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, has become a cause
celebre within an industry wary of Microsoft Corp.'s domination of
both operating systems, with Windows, and the business application
programs that run on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the darling of ``open source'' advocates. Open Source
is based on the concept that making a program's underlying code
freely available, and allowing it to be modified by anyone, will
result in a more powerful and secure system and will free consumers
from the tyranny of proprietary operating systems, especially
Windows. Linux grew out of the GNU Project, an effort to build a
free operating system similar to Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Linux kernel and associated GNU (pronounced NEW)
components can be downloaded for free by anybody, more than 22
companies now sell GNU/Linux software. The best known are Red Hat,
Suse, Turbo Linux, Caldera Systems and Mandrake Soft.
</P>
<P>
   As the notion that Linux could be a viable alternative to
Windows has gained currency, these companies have captured the
imagination of investors.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that notion was fed by Microsoft itself, which insisted
earlier this year in its antitrust battle with the government that
Linux threatened its Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were not there for the great IPO of the '80s see
this as an opportunity to ride the crest again, as Microsoft II,''
said Maureen O'Gara, publisher of Client Server News, a trade
publication. ``This is not based on fundamentals. They don't read
beyond the first page of the prospectus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of VA Linux, she said, ``The fact that they could be
crushed by one finger of Dell's hand has not slowed their flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of Linux-based computers are expected to grow by 25
percent from 1999 through 2003, more than twice the 10 percent to
12 percent pace for other workstation and server systems, according
to the International Data Corp., a market research firm based in
Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of increase is possible only because the market
today is so miniscule. Lost in the excitement about Linux is the
fact that the actual user base today is tiny compared with Windows,
commercial versions of the Unix operating system or Apple
Computer's Mac OS. Although Linux proponents often say that the
operating system is more reliable and secure than Windows NT, major
corporations have not been eager to run mission-critical
applications on Linux. Those that have embraced Unix are more
likely to purchase Solaris from Sun Microsystems, HP/UX from
Hewlett-Packard or other name brands.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux's biggest sales have been to Internet companies,
including Akamai Technologies, eToys, StarMedia Network, and 24/7
Media. Sales to these four customers accounted for 14.5 percent of
the company's total revenue in fiscal 1999 and 23.3 percent in the
first quarter of fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Linux is going to kill Microsoft, but I say, `How
do you do that without killing Sun first?''' said Michael Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. ``I don't think
they have any understanding of what Linux is, what it means, the
fact that it's free.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, VA Linux was represented by leading investment
banks, and had previously attracted savvy venture investors. Credit
Suisse First Boston was the lead underwriter, with Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and Lehman Brothers as the
co-managers of the offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company's backers include the Silicon Valley venture capital
firm Sequoia Capital, which holds a 23 percent stake, and Intel,
which holds an 8.9 percent stake.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a jury ruled in a wrongful death trial in Memphis
on Wednesday afternoon, it became the first judicial panel to hold
someone responsible for playing a role in the assassination of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But with key players long dead, with confessions recanted and
altered, and with a vast conspiracy alleged but not proven,
Wednesday's verdict in the civil trial of Loyd Jowers may
ultimately do little to untangle the knot of fact and theory
surrounding one of the century's most traumatic events
</P>
<P>
   The jury in Memphis declared Jowers liable, purportedly for
hiring a now-deceased Memphis police officer as part of a vast
conspiracy to kill King, after a four-week trial that was notable
for the passivity of the defense, for the prevalence of second-hand
and third-hand witness accounts and for the propensity of the judge
and jurors to nod off during testimony. At one point, James E.
Swearengen of Shelby County Circuit Court allowed unsworn testimony
from a 1993 mock television trial of James Earl Ray to be
introduced as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unusual nature of the Memphis trial, King's widow
and children exulted Thursday in the verdict, saying it vindicated
their nearly three-year effort to revive the investigation into
King's killing. In February 1997, the family began pushing for a
new trial for James Earl Ray, the career criminal who pleaded
guilty in 1969 to killing King, received a 99-year sentence, and
then quickly recanted and argued that he had been duped by a
shadowy figure named ``Raul'' into playing a patsy for the real
killer. While Ray never faced a jury, his conviction was upheld
repeatedly by appellate courts and a congressional committee
concluded in 1978 that he was the killer, although he may have had
help.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had been convinced by William F. Pepper, Ray's lawyer,
that the assassination had been planned and executed by a
government conspiracy, reaching from the FBI and the CIA to Lyndon
B. Johnson's White House. The federal government, Pepper maintains,
feared King's growing denunciations of the Vietnam War and his
threats to clog Washington with massive protests by the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Ray died in prison of liver disease. Several
months later, with Pepper as their lawyer, the Kings filed their
wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers, who had said in a 1993
television interview that he hired a man to kill King at the behest
of a Memphis grocery owner named Frank Liberto. Pepper maintains
that Liberto was working for a Mafia boss in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Thursday, seated at a table with a
view of King's crypt, the civil rights leader's widow and children
made it clear that they now consider the case closed. The ``most
incredible coverup of the century,'' said Dexter Scott King, one of
King's four children, has now been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened,'' King said. ``This is the period at
the end of the sentence. So please, after today, we don't want
questions like `Do you believe James Earl Ray killed your father?'
I've been hearing that all my life. No, I don't, and this is the
end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where Justice Department investigators have been
reviewing aspects of the assassination at the request of the King
family, officials said Thursday that the Memphis verdict was
unlikely to alter their review. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
said the Justice Department's report was nearly complete, and said
that criminal charges were not likely to be brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not expect that there would be any criminal
prosecution out of our report,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Scott King said that his family, which asked for and
received $100 in damages from the jury in Memphis, does not care
what the Justice Department does next. ``We did not do this to
force their hands,'' he said. ``I doubt seriously they would indict
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, which began on Nov. 15, the jury was presented
with sometimes contradictory and often confusing details of an
elaborate plot to kill King. Many of the approximately 70 witnesses
appeared in person. But others, including the ailing 73-year-old
Jowers testified only through depositions or unsworn audiotaped or
videotaped accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Often, lawyers introduced long and tedious videotaped or written
accounts, seemingly more to create an official record than to sway
the jury. For instance, Jowers' lawyer devoted a day and a half to
having a 300-page 1995 deposition of Ray read into the record. When
the reading was finished, members of the jury clapped in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, jurors could be seen nodding off and Swearengen, who
is due to retire at the end of this year, was seen napping in court
as well. Opinions by members of the King family about the testimony
of witnesses were presented to jurors without objection from the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Judge Joe Brown, who presided in criminal court
over the last attempts by Pepper to win a trial for Ray, testified
as an expert witness in ballistics. Brown, who presides over both a
real courtroom and a television court in Hollywood, used his
extensive layman's knowledge of guns to maintain that Ray's rifle
was not the weapon that killed King.
</P>
<P>
   And Pepper also presented videotape from a staged mock
television trial. In the mock trial, which was broadcast on HBO in
1993, Earl Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter who was at
the scene of the assassination, said his editor had sent him to
Memphis in 1968 to ``nail Dr. King.'' That videotape was used to
bolster one of Pepper's main contentions, that the news media was,
and still is, controlled by the CIA and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was also notable for what was not presented to the
jury, including changes in Jowers' story and various
inconsistencies alleged by Memphis prosecutors between his accounts
and those of other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 report by the Shelby County District attorney General
said that Jowers originally claimed he hired a ``black man'' from
Memphis to kill King. But the Kings and Pepper maintain that Jowers
later suggested that a white police officer named Earl Clark, now
deceased, was the shooter. ``That's the killer,'' Dexter Scott King
said Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The same report by the district's attorney general concluded
that the inconsistencies created such a lack of credibility that
the conspiracy theory involving Jowers ``can be dismissed
outright.'' Jowers' lawyer, Lewis K. Garrison Sr., who did little
cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, presented that
voluminous report to the jury during closing arguments and asked
them to read it, but did not offer guidance on its findings. It is
doubtful the jurors studied it during deliberations that lasted
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, a Memphis prosecutor who reinvestigated the King
case and doubts Jowers' claims scoffed at the evidence presented in
the civil trial, where the standard of proof is lower than in a
criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tried to put that kind of proof in front of a criminal
jury, I could lose my law license,'' he said. ``The trouble with
Pepper's theories is he quotes sources he never names and if you do
not agree with him you are part of the conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Posner, an author who concluded in a 1998 book that Ray
was King's assassin, predicted that the Memphis trial ``will be a
footnote, at best'' to the history of the slaying. ``The defense in
this trial was so lethargic it raises the question of its
sincerity,'' he said. People want to embrace the sweeping
conspiracy theory, he said, ``because it matches the stature of the
man and somehow gives even more meaning and power to his death.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SAMARANCH WON'T FACE A SUBPOENA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has come to this: Before the head of the world Olympic
movement testifies before Congress, he first brokers an agreement
that he will not be slapped with a piece of paper on the steps of
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   How the mighty have fallen. Juan Antonio Samaranch is coming to
America next Wednesday, direct from this weekend's meeting in
Lausanne, Switzerland. He is expected to brandish a mandate for
reform of the very same International Olympic Committee that he has
led for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also wants to discuss some of the dealings between crass
officials of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City and
sticky-fingered delegates.
</P>
<P>
   So many Olympic officials are worried about being questioned
that there is talk of an IOC meeting, scheduled for Colorado
Springs in February, being shifted out of the United States to keep
Olympic delegates from being served subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   At least Samaranch does not have to worry next week. Thursday he
agreed to speak with the feds, but at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought professional athletes and huge corporate and
television money into the former haven of ``amateur sports'' is
coming to Washington on Wednesday to testify before the House
Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, whose
chairman is Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves the Olympics,'' Upton said Thursday in a
telephone interview. ``I remember watching the Americans win the
hockey gold medal in 1980, one of the great moments in sports
history. Now I go to my 8-year-old's soccer practice and the coach
puts his finger in my chest and says, `You've got to straighten out
these Olympics.'''
</P>
<P>
   Upton has already voted to impeach President Clinton during the
Monica Lewinsky episode. Now he has invited the man called His
Excellency to a special hearing while Congress is on recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contribute to the Olympics as taxpayers and as private
citizens,'' Upton said. ``America foots most of the bills from
television and corporate support. We can't have this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the delegates ousted so far have come from so-called
Third World countries, but the givers are as guilty as the takers.
When that smug little corner of the world, Salt Lake City, tried to
compete for the Winter Games, its leading sports and business
officials acted from craven instinct and tried to buy off the IOC
delegates, many of whom were quite available.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got involved, I thought maybe Salt Lake City was an
aberration,'' Upton said Thursday, adding that his subcommittee's
diligent prodding of Atlanta officials only showed how widespread
the bribery was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a culture of corruption,'' Upton said. ``Jobs, visas,
cash, sex. There wasn't anything that wasn't available. It just
makes you sick.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not an American disease, by any means. Halfway around
the world, Sydney used blatant payoffs and the specter of civil
rights abuses in China to defeat Beijing by two votes for the right
to be the host of the 2000 Summer Games. Having procured those
Games by hook and by crook, the Sydney officials showed their own
sleazy instincts by hiding as many as 800,000 tickets, to be sold
at exorbitant prices to friends and corporate patrons. Many of
those tickets have now been made available to the public, but the
Sydney officials seem alarmingly unabashed.
</P>
<P>
   And still Juan Antonio Samaranch holds onto his job. When he
appears before the subcommittee with the presumed reform package,
His Excellency can expect to be treated respectfully but not
necessarily gently. A trace of haughtiness just might touch off a
representative who has flown back from the home district.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has had a charmed career, starting as one of the rare
Catalan natives to prosper under the Franco regime in Spain, then
as Spanish ambassador to the Soviet Union and now for 20 years as
the leader of the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised the Olympics into a wealthy pageant, and he has
also used the Games to make the biennial plea for an end to
violence, particularly toward ``the children of the world.'' For a
long time, there was the buzz, undoubtedly from within the IOC,
that Samaranch might be considered for a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   That talk has ended since somebody looked at the goodies being
exchanged under the table in Salt Lake City, but at least Samaranch
will not be publicly hounded by the FBI. This is not a tradeoff
that Juan Antonio Samaranch ever thought would happen. &QL;

<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia _ Russian officials vowed on Thursday to return
the flood of refugees in a neighboring republic to
Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse migration of thousands of people appears intended to
demonstrate that Russia is making process in stabilizing Chechnya,
that it is containing the problem there and that talk of a human
disaster is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist the move will improve the plight of the
refugees, who have been trapped in primitive camps in the
neighboring republic, Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the people out of the tent camps and rail cars of
Ingushetia,'' Nikolai Koshman, the Russian deputy prime minister
who serves as Moscow's senior representative to Chechnya, said in
an interview. ``The conditions there are really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russian authorities are prepared to care for the
refugees they are planning to bring back is another question. At
the same time they are encouraging refugees to return, the Russian
military is urging civilians in Grozny _ estimated at anywhere from
15,000 to 50,000 _ to leave for those same camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has laid siege to the Chechen capital and
has urged the civilians to leave so it has a free hand in pummeling
rebels who have taken up positions there.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago Russian warplanes dropped leaflets over Grozny
urging residents to escape the city or face a deadly bombardment.
After strong criticism from the West, Moscow softened its tone, but
did not remove the threat of a decisive assault on the Islamic
militants there.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the influx of returning refugees, Russia is hastening
to complete several tent cities in Chechnya. But the capacity of
the camps totals only about 15,000 to 17,000. Thousands of other
Chechens would have to settle in towns that only recently were war
zones and which are still without basic services.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty Russia is having in restoring Chechen towns was
evident on Thursday in Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city.
The grim city, which still bears the scars of the first war in
Chechnya, is being used as the administration center of the
Russian-controlled part of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have touted Gudermes as something of a
showcase and they announced with fanfare several weeks ago that gas
and electricity were being restored. Residents who gathered in the
mud-filled square in front of the town's administration building
said on Thursday that the city was calmer than it was a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday the electricity was on the blink, forcing
Koshman to hold a meeting with local officials in a darkened room.
A local hospital was without heat, and had to deal with the sick
almost entirely on an out-patient basis. Residents complained that
they received little food or other basic assistance. ``We need
help,'' said Khamzat Akhmadov, 46, who said he had received two
cans of stewed meat and 15 pounds of flour for his six-member
family.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the latest Chechen war, the plight of
Chechnya's refugees have been a wrenching and explosive problem.
Tens of thousands rushed to the border when the Russian bombs began
to fall. As the refugee camps grew in Ingushetia, the Russians
temporarily sealed the border, leaving thousands of people stranded
in Chechnya and setting off an international outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Ingush authorities say more than 200,000 people have sought
refuge on their territory, but Russian officials and some Chechens
here maintain that Ingushetia has exaggerated the situation to
obtain extra financial aid, and that the current total does not
exceed 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the Russian effort involves thousands of refugees
in rail cars or in tents not fit for winter. Russia also hopes to
lighten the burden on Ruslan Aushev, Ingushetia's president, who
has complained about the enormous difficulties his republic is
facing.
</P>
<P>
   To hasten a resolution, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of Russia
signed a decree last month ordering Russian authorities to disband
the refugee camps in Ingushetia by Dec. 25 and to move the people
there to Chechnya. On Thursday, Koshman said that was still the
plan, though he said the deadline might slip a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conditions are being created for their return,'' he
said. ``I think people will want to come back.'' But whether all
the refugees will want to return in the face of Russian occupation
is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the refugees, tent cities are being built at
Znamenskoye, Sernovodsk and Asinovskaya. The tent cities at
Znamenskoye, which workers are still rushing to finish, have gas
heat and are close to schools, making them relatively comfortable
by the standards of other camps.
</P>
<P>
   But there total capacity is just part of what seems to be
needed. Koshman said he expected many refugees to return to their
homes in newly captured cities like Urus-Martan, which recently
fell to Russian troops. That would reduce the crunch at the camps _
assuming the cities in Chechnya can be repaired and supplied with
heat and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   If suitable accommodations cannot be found for all of the
returning refugees, the Russian government is considering moving
some of the rail car shelters from Ingushetia to Chechnya,
duplicating the conditions it is trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin talked about disbanding the refugee camps in
Ingushetia, Koshman insisted that none of the refugees would be
forcibly returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to them,'' he insisted. ``We will provide
electricity, and I think people will come back.''

TEXAS FAILS TO REPORT APPARENT GUN LAW VIOLATIONS FOR SEVERAL
YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
And R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   State officials have known for years about hundreds of convicted
criminals who may have violated gun laws in Texas, but none of
those cases were sent to prosecutors until Thursday, a spokeswoman
for the Department of Public Safety said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible violations involve 750 to 800 people with criminal
pasts who candidly acknowledged in gun license applications that
they had used a firearm, DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   It is against federal law for a felon to ever use, or even
possess, a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were sent Thursday to prosecutors in Austin who are
assigned to the ``Texas Exile'' project. The project was recently
formed by Gov. George W. Bush and state Attorney General John
Cornyn to bear down on gun-law violators through implementation of
penalties available under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``complete coincidence,'' Mange said, that the cases
were transferred on the same day that news broke about the state's
years-long delay in considering whether laws were violated.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly accused Bush, the front-running Republican
candidate for president, of failing to back up his campaign's
support of strong gun-law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being a hypocrite here, and it reveals how hollow his
rhetoric is,'' said Rick Hess, spokesman for the Democratic
National Committee. ``Bush can't have it both ways. He can't say
the answer to gun safety is better enforcement, when he's not
enforcing the law himself,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts, a lobbyist for Texans Against Gun Violence, said
Bush should be held at least partly responsible for the DPS'
failure to immediately report the gun-law violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know is that there are a lot of dangerous people out
there right now, and they have their hands on guns. ... And under
Bush's leadership, nothing was done to prosecute them,'' said
Butts, whose open-records request first revealed the ignored
violations.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott McClellan, a spokesman in Austin for the Bush
campaign, said it was the governor's ``leadership that prompted the
DPS'' to transfer the files to Texas Exile prosecutors. ``The
governor's office called the DPS'' about the cases, McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS began learning of the violations in 1996 while
conducting background checks on people who had applied for a
concealed handgun license, Mange said. As part of that written
application, she said, a person has to show proof of taking a ``gun
proficiency'' training class.
</P>
<P>
   The applicants must also note whether they have ever been
convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases sent to prosecutors yesterday, applicants showed
proof of taking a training course, which requires using a gun, and
they also noted that their past included a criminal conviction,
Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   She said licenses were denied to anyone with a felony
conviction, but that the state did not go a step further and notify
proper authorities that a felon may have illegally used a gun _
even if it was only in a training class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never tried to forward it on. We held on to the records,''
Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the DPS did not have the ``resources'' to pass on the
information, and ``normally, prosecutors expect to have more ...
than just that we think a felon touched a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leading advocates of gunowners' rights said the DPS
should have immediately contacted prosecutors. But they did not
blame Bush for the oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the governor's place to do the research if DPS has
found out that someone is unqualified to have a ... concealed
handgun license,'' said Randy Gibson, executive director of the
Texas State Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said the association does not support stricter gun laws,
but that those already on the books should be enforced.
``Otherwise, why have the law?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A right-to-carry advocate whose parents were killed in a mass
shooting, state Rep. Suzanna Gratia Hupp, R-Lampasas, said she
found it ``quite maddening'' that the cases had not been referred
to prosecutors earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really bothers and offends me that so many people are
screaming for stricter gun-control laws, when we're not enforcing
the ones that we have,'' Hupp said.

EDITORIAL: A TOUCHING TRIBUTE IN WORCESTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 11:
</P>
<P>
   At a moving memorial service attended by thousands of
firefighters from around the country and several foreign countries,
President Clinton paid tribute Thursday to the six firemen who
perished battling the inferno-like blaze that broke out at an
abandoned warehouse in Worcester, Mass., last Friday. Fittingly,
the president also took the occasion to pay homage to the nation's
entire family of firefighters _ the men and women whose willingness
to risk injury and death in order to protect others, Clinton noted,
is too often taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester blaze, and the courage shown by the firefighters
who battled it with lethal results amid unbearable heat and
blinding smoke, was a reminder of the risks routinely faced by
firefighters everywhere when they answer an alarm. So far this year
100 firefighters have been killed in the line of duty in this
country, a death toll roughly comparable to that suffered by
crime-fighting police during the same period. In New York City
alone, 13 firefighters have lost their lives since 1995, according
to Fire Department records. Many more have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony, President Clinton quoted from Benjamin
Franklin's salute to firefighters contained in an essay, ``Brave
Men at Fires.'' ``Neither cold nor darkness will deter good people
from hastening to the dreadful place to quench the flame,''
Franklin wrote. All these years later, battling flames remains what
it has always been _ an honorable, necessary and extremely
dangerous job.

   In a recent national survey of 129 companies, Ceridian Employer
Services of Minneapolis found that 65 percent believed that ``work
perks'' helped to attract and retain employees.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular were casual-dress policies, offered at 82
percent of the companies; flexible hours, 60.5 percent; personal
development training, 49 percent; entertainment and product
discounts, 40 percent; and free food and beverages, 36 percent.

themselves in a competitive job market and to create a culture that
appealed to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, such perks don't cost much, she added, and they
can help create loyalty among existing employees while attracting
new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that we need to be extremely creative in the
types of environments we create,'' Ms. McNutt said.

I DIDN'T BUY THE STOCK. SO WHY IS MY HEART RACING?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lately I've been feeling guilty about my
health-club regimen. Yes, I work out enough to stay in shape. But
the trouble is, I almost never make thousands of dollars in the
stock market at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   That failing leaves me behind the avant-garde of exercise _
something called the Netpulse Station. A marvel of multitasking,
the Netpulse lets you ride a stationary bike, listen to music,
watch TV or DVD, surf the Web, send and receive e-mail and even
engage in online trading.
</P>
<P>
   It puts you in front of a touch-screen computer _ at a sort of
mini-office, but one where profuse perspiration is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   You even earn sweat equity _ a reward for watching the
advertising on the screen. ``You earn airline miles for each minute
you work out,'' said Tom Proulx, the president and chief executive
of Netpulse Communications.
</P>
<P>
   So in the spirit of Silicon Valley, I descended recently on the
Bay Club, a chichi San Francisco gym, with a vow to shed my
anachronistic views of exercise. My plan was to ride the bike,
listen to tunes, surf the Web, and, in a feat of elite
multitasking, use the Net to place a highly profitable stock trade.
And I would do so without pharmaceutical enhancement. That's right,
no ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the prospect of simultaneously strengthening my abs
and my assets, I was uneasy. Isn't exercise supposed to be a
sanctuary, a time reserved for not having to be productive? Should
life force us to constantly compete in a digital decathlon, in
which we are made to feel lazy if we don't check our voice mail
while skeet shooting? And what if a wild market swing caused me to
pull a hamstring?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the physical hazards of multitasking. Louis
Tijerina, a transportation researcher and member of the Human
Factors and Ergonomics Society of Santa Monica, Calif., explained
that doing too many things at once could lead to what is called
focus depletion. That is a particular problem when people are
driving, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (I confess to a particular fear of being run down by someone
talking on the cell phone and checking e-mail while driving a sport
utility vehicle to Starbucks.)
</P>
<P>
   But what about the risks of concurrently exercising and
day-trading technology stocks? ``Good luck,'' Tijerina said. ``It's
your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounting the Netpulse, I quickly found that the scientists had a
point: It wasn't easy to perform all the tasks at hand.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it was difficult to type on the touch-screen
while pedaling _ I spent 15 minutes just logging on. Then I surfed
to the home page of my brokerage firm and couldn't find the ticker
symbol for the stock I wanted to buy, Matchmaker.com. It was a tip
from Jordan Shay, a personal trainer at the Bay Club, who doled out
financial advice while giving fitness counsel to other patrons.
</P>
<P>
   I also suffered a multitasking-related ailment thanks to my
persistent prodding at the touch screen _ my first-ever
index-finger injury from riding a stationary bike. I was breaking a
sweat all right, but it was because of my Web surfing, not my
intermittent pedaling.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick break, I climbed back on the bike and renewed my
assault, but with better equipment. Cell phone in hand, I called my
broker for help in placing the stock trade. I logged on again and
plugged my headphones into the CD player. I began to pedal, point
and click, a picture of productivity, my multitasking summit in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, trouble. My broker informed me that
Matchmaker.com is not yet a public company, so obviously I couldn't
buy the stock. Second, I had taken so long that the market had
closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, my effort collapsed. The day trade was not to
be. I was Icarus with a cell phone. ``Well,'' Shay told me,
``that's what you get for taking stock tips from a personal
trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   As I folded my electronics and athletic shoes into my gym bag, I
realized I had asked too much of him _ and of myself. Maybe I'm a
mono-tasker at heart, a relatively unproductive plebe taking cues
not from dot.com executives but from Thoreau and Walden Pond. Next
time I'm here for a workout, I'll look up his Web site.

 &HT;    Education tops Florida Democrats' agenda
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Stressing that their party has shed its
discord from a year ago, House and Senate Democrats rolled out a
unified 2000 agenda Thursday that focuses on public education,
health care and gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced one day before the start of this weekend's
Democratic State Convention in Orlando, calls for 10 percent salary
increases for teachers and the infusion of 10,000 teachers into
Florida's public schools. The price tag: $840 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the agenda is limited because Republicans control both
chambers, by a margin of 75-45 in the House and 24-15 in the Senate
(one special election will occur in January to replace Sen. Al
Gutman, R-Miami).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is simply riding the wave of success of
this governor,'' said Senate Democratic Leader Buddy Dyer of
Orlando, flanked Thursday by 18 of his colleagues at a Capitol news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leaders believe the new agenda, which also pushes
for the use of gun safety locks and patients' rights to sue
insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, unifies
the party and will boost their election chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago when Republicans took over, we went through a
confusing time,'' said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-West Palm Beach), who
is leading House efforts in the 2000 campaigns. ``But this past
year, we've seen the `for sale' sign on public policy and we are no
longer confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the slogan, ``We're on Your Side,'' they singled out
Republican-sponsored measures last year that they say benefit
``wealthy special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they mentioned a $1.1 million tax break for
country club members, later vetoed by Gov. Jeb Bush, and a new law
that allows people with concealed weapons permits in other states
to carry their guns in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans point to the school voucher plan and 10-20-Life
law, which targets violent criminals who use guns in felony crimes,
as proof of their pro-family record.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``greedy lawyers and teachers'' who support the Democratic
initiatives, said House Majority Leader Jerry Maygarden
(R-Pensacola).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the GOP agenda mirrors that of ``Florida's working
parents, children and our seniors, and our growing numbers are
proof of that,'' he said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros placed a bold check mark next to Item No. 1 on their
offseason list of things to do, signing second baseman Craig Biggio
to a three-year contract extension worth $28 million Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agreement eliminates the risk of losing Biggio as a free
agent after the 2000 season and locks up the seven-time All-Star
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio will receive a $7 million signing bonus to be paid in $1
million installments in each of the next four years, with a $3
million payment due in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old second baseman will earn base salaries of $6
million in 2001, $7 million in 2002 and $8 million 2003. He already
was under contract for $5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With an average annual salary of $8 million, Biggio joins
Cleveland's Roberto Alomar as the highest-paid second basemen in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig has established himself as one of the best players in
the game,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``No single
player has meant more to this franchise since its inception than
Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is on track to become the first (career) Houston Astro to
be elected to the Hall of Fame when his career is completed. We
targeted this as our most important move of the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are the only organization for which Biggio has played
since being drafted in the first round in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to spend just about your entire career with one
organization is a great feeling,'' the native New Yorker said. ``In
this day and age, it just doesn't happen very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an East Coast kid, 21 years old, and I survived 13 years
in Texas. Now, I have a few more, and you couldn't ask for a better
situation. I couldn't think of a better time to be wearing an
Astros uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio debuted with the Astros toward the end of their success
in the late 1980s and was around for some lean years in the early
1990s. He and first baseman Jeff Bagwell formed the backbone of a
team that has won the National League Central Division title the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The contract extension allows Biggio to help the Astros make
another run at the postseason without uncertainty regarding his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have bothered me to go through the entire season
without getting a deal done,'' he said. ``But it's just nice to
know that management thought enough about me that they wanted to
get it done beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio hit .294 with 16 home runs, 73 RBIs, 28 stolen bases and
a club-record 56 doubles in 1999 as he became only the sixth player
to have at least 50 doubles in back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best leadoff hitter in baseball,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``It's such a dynamic spot in the lineup, and it's
been such a tremendous strength for our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's continually trying to get better. His offense speaks for
itself, but his defensive accomplishments are just as important _
if not more important _ as the things he does with his bat and on
the bases. He's a complete player, and it's hard to find complete
players at the major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many players who had success in the minor leagues were able to
do almost everything, but when they get to the majors, if there's a
weakness, it will be exposed. At this stage in his career, we have
a guy who has no discernible weakness. This was the most important
step we could take this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   With Biggio secured for four years, the Astros can turn their
attention to center fielder Carl Everett and lefthander Mike
Hampton, both of whom can become free agents after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker hopes to sign each to a contract extension, but the
general manager has acknowledged that players who are not signed
beyond the 2000 season are candidates to be traded _ perhaps at the
winter meetings, which commence today in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After the coming season, the Astros will face a similar
situation with Bagwell, who is signed through 2001. By then,
Bagwell might be in position to demand a salary in excess of $15
million a year, leading some to wonder if Bagwell will end his
career in an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has been able to do some unbelievable things
here,'' Biggio said. ``If you lose Baggy, you're going to be losing
a tremendous part of your ballclub. You can't lose a guy like that.
If anyone can get it done, (owner) Drayton (McLane Jr.) will get it
done. I'm not really concerned about that, because I know it will
get done.''

JUST A COUPLE EXTRA ZEROS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12)

   So many people had such good stories about expense accounts and
the mischief they inspire that a second column on the subject
seemed to be merited. Without further ado, here is an accounting: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Lynn Porter of Larchmont, N.Y., tells the story of an
executive who, early in his career, was transferred to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told his boss he needed a Blazer `because of all the
snow,''' says Ms. Porter, senior executive vice president of the
Sidney Frank Importing Co., importers of Jagermeister and Grey
Goose vodka. ``His boss said, `O.K.' and told him to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out and bought his wife a Chevy Blazer and put the
expense on his expense report,'' Ms. Porter continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When his boss saw the expense, he was shocked at the thousands
of dollars and asked what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive explained that he had bought a Blazer automobile
as discussed and approved previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``His boss told him he had meant `one with three buttons.'''
</P>
<P>
   (The expense was approved.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I once put in for lunch with a horse,'' writes Steve Zousmer
of Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the Kentucky Derby as chief writer for `Good Morning
America' in 1978, the year of the great Affirmed-Alydar rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Churchill Downs representative had been assigned to the
television staff, but there was a limit to how many people could
plausibly claim to have taken him to every meal every day. So I
alleged that I had gained editorial perspective in an $11 lunch
with `Derby insider Raymond Earl.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond Earl, with his conveniently human but unrecognized
name, did indeed run in the Derby, and as far as I know, he's still
running. But I finished in the money. If challenged, I would have
claimed $6 for my hamburger and $5 in oats for the big fella.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years ago, I had a new sales manager who made frequent
trips to Philadelphia, presumably on company business,'' writes
Richard Carlton of White Plains, who was then the executive vice
president of a television syndication production company. ``His
expense sheets were fairly normal and aroused no suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, Carlton's assistant mentioned that the manager ``had a
unique way of solving his laundry problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her comment went right by me, but knowing that he was single
and lived alone, I thought about it the next time he went to
Philadelphia,'' Carlton says. ``Sure enough, the expense sheet had
a revelation: Laundry _ $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it was a one-night stay, it seemed odd, so I sent for
the past expense sheets, and for the first time examined the hotel
bill. Every one had laundry running upward of $8 on overnight
stays.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton says he then realized how the manager solved his laundry
problems: ``Pack a bag with dirty laundry, check in for an
overnight, send the laundry down for express service and _ bingo! _
problem solved.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it, Carlton recalled, the manager ``tried to
make light of his unusual technique, but the game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A quick check with his accounts in Philadelphia ended the
story. They hadn't seen him in months, but he did call once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then goodbye to the manager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Smyster, the founding editor of The Oak Ridger, a daily
newspaper in Oak Ridge, Tenn., recalls that in the paper's early
years, one of the sundry jobs of the small news staff was to
conduct tour groups, usually children, through the plant.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that after one such tour, one staff member submitted
the following expense claim:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three peppermint candies (AT) 2 cents each in order to cover
up odor of Friday lunch beer before taking Girl Scouts through
office on tour.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   ``As part of my introduction to expense account policies at a
company I had just joined, I was told that everyone in the company
flew coach class on domestic flights,'' writes Ronald J. Rakowski
of Bethel, Conn., a former human resources vice president for a
major corporation. ``However, first-class travel was OK if coach
seating wasn't available.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I didn't consider the policy particularly onerous, one
of my fellow department managers didn't think the policy applied to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd often boast that he would simply lie on his expense
account about the availability of coach seating and fly first
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it soon came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``While attending a Chicago meeting with my boss, he received a
call from our Denver division asking us to come out and handle a
labor problem at one of its operations. So we detoured to Denver
and, after addressing the local labor problem, booked passage back
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we threaded our way back to our seats in the nearly vacant
coach section, whom should we spot perched in first class sipping a
free drink? Yep! My fellow department manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss was outraged. During the rather long flight home, he'd
settle down for a while before breaking out with another diatribe
on the importance of honesty and following company policies. He
usually avoided drinking alcohol on flights, but he had a couple
that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my boss said to the manager after we landed,
but the guy resigned shortly thereafter.''

<P>
   Machiavelli as role model? Machiavelli as business guru at the
cusp of the you-know-what? Niccolo Machiavelli, symbol of all
that's calculating and cold-blooded?
</P>
<P>
   Are they kidding?
</P>
<P>
   No, the Prince of Expediency has been having his own renaissance
of late, his name gracing the cover of one book after another, from
``The New Machiavelli: The Art of Politics in Business'' to ``The
Machiavellian Manager's Handbook for Success'' to ``What Would
Machiavelli Do?'' And, lest nonprinces feel left out, ``The
Princessa: Machiavelli for Women'' and ``A Child's Machiavelli: A
Primer on Power.''
</P>
<P>
   That last one (Penguin Studio, $14.95), by Claudia Hart, is an
odd specimen indeed: It has the look of a children's book _
snippets of cuddly text meandering alongside cute drawings. But you
might think twice, at least, about reading those words at the
frilly bedside of your 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling: ``Either be really nice to people or kill 'em.''
``If you wanna give presents to people, make sure it's other
people's stuff.'' ``People who cheat are always more successful
than people who are honest.'' ``You have to destroy everything'' _
this with a drawing, a la ``The Little Prince,'' of a planet as
rapidly deflating balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Who could this book possibly be for? A little rib-tickling
stocking-stuffer for the corporate princes on your list? The jacket
copy, so kindly, acknowledges the book's ``tongue-in-cheek
concept.'' Oh, so that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Tongue practically punctures cheek, meanwhile, in ``What Would
Machiavelli Do?'' (Harper Business, $21), by Stanley Bing. The
cutely outrageous tone is set in the dedication: ``I'm going to do
what Machiavelli would tell me to do, and dedicate this book to
myself.'' No, it's actually set on the dust jacket: ``So start
reading. Or get out of here. You're beginning to get on our
nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bing, a Fortune columnist with a (sort of) secret life as a
television executive, sprinkles in modern-day case studies of a
sort, like everyone's favorite gold-plated, high-rise ego on
wheels: ``Donald Trump would be a failed real-estate agent if he
didn't have the world's biggest need to tell everybody how great he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying for a good business reason, Bing writes, is now called
``positioning, and people get paid good money to do it, lucky for
me.'' (A little hint about Bing's day job.)
</P>
<P>
   But mainly he indulges his flamboyant outrageousness: ``Don't
like it? Get over it, you sniveling tree hugger.'' ``You have
enormous selfishness within you. Let it out. Let it flower.''
``You'll have to find, cultivate, and celebrate your insanity if
you have any hope of ruling others.'' On the Dalai Lama: ``I hear
he can get really cranky when they screw up his reservation at
Spago.'' It wears thin before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Machiavellian Manager's Handbook for Success'' (Libey
Publishing, $14.95), by L.F. Gunlicks, plays it a little
straighter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lest the title lead you to think it's a how-to manual, you are
encouraged to use the book as ``an entertainment source,'' perhaps,
or ``to identify the Machiavellian Manager to avoid the carnage he
eventually causes.''
</P>
<P>
   And to shatter any hint of doubt, this disclaimer: ``I am not
advocating Machiavellian behaviors _ I detest and deplore them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunlicks sums up: ``Although I have slightly exaggerated parts
of the descriptions of Machiavellian Managers, the beasts are out
there. If you don't believe me, just look around _ or in a
mirror.'' Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Machiavelli'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $16.95), by Alistair
McAlpine, also goes for serious analysis: ``The point is not that
Machiavelli advocated evil-doing; rather that he accepted that all
human activity, and especially politics, will involve evil-doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are whimsical touches. ``Clearly,'' he writes, ``it is not
possible at the turn of the 20th century to behead managing
directors.'' But the tone is mainly earnest: ``Courage, honor,
energy, ability, perseverance and, above all, dedication are the
ingredients of success.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``Machiavelli would find the last years of the 20th century
a strange world, for much has changed since the 15th century, not
least the attitude of women towards men who would beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Women. That's where ``The Princessa'' (Doubleday, $22),
by Harriet Rubin, comes in. Citing everyone from Cordelia to
Scheherazade, she strives to define a distinctly feminine type of
power. Unlike the prince, ``the princessa cannot cripple the
enemy,'' Ms. Rubin writes. ``She must make her opponent an
unwitting ally.''
</P>
<P>
   Her one-liners are tasty: ``I have found a way for a woman to
become the artist of her anger and her desire.'' ``Women are the
fiercer sex. The Greek poets and philosophers trembled before
women.'' ``Why fight like Machiavelli when we can fight like
Machiavella?''
</P>
<P>
   She even quotes E.M. Forster, about ``enlarging the space in
which you may be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   By her rules, Hillary Rodham Clinton doesn't cut it. In the
health care fight, she tried to keep control, but a true princessa,
Ms. Rubin writes, ``makes her war others' war too.''
</P>
<P>
   So what to do with these books? Most are petite, sized just
right for bizarre little gifts _ if you can just figure out who
deserves them.

 &HT;    Florida Gov. Bush fights to reduce death row delays
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Ready to spend millions more taxpayer
dollars to do so, Gov. Jeb Bush on Thursday called a special
legislative session to pick up the pace at which Florida kills its
condemned murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, House Speaker John Thrasher and Senate President Toni
Jennings agreed to discuss shortening the time for death row
appeals, lessening the influence of jury recommendations in capital
cases, limiting the options available to state-paid death row
lawyers and making lethal injection the primary method of execution
_ all in two and a half days in January.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious of the changes, so-called ``parallel
tracking'' of death penalty appeals, is modeled after the system in
Texas, where Jeb's older brother, George W. Bush, is governor.
Texas leads the nation in executions each year.
</P>
<P>
   Because about half of all death sentences in Florida are
overturned by the state Supreme Court in the first round of
appeals, Bush's new plan would mean half of the secondary appeals,
which would be done simultaneously, would be wasted effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cost a little more, but I think it's worth it,'' Bush
said, conceding that he didn't yet know how much more but that
staff members would produce the numbers in time for the Jan. 5-7
session.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups and defense lawyers predict some of the
proposed changes will backfire, ultimately delaying executions with
lengthy court challenges over their constitutionality _ changes,
for example, such as limiting state-paid death row lawyers, but not
privately paid lawyers, to one appeal in each state and federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Spalding, an American Civil Liberties Union lobbyist, said
lawmakers, in their rush to write and pass complicated laws in just
a few weeks, would undoubtedly give defense lawyers vast new areas
to explore. ``They haven't been able to get it right yet,'' he
said. ``I'm reasonably comfortable that they won't get it right
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The session was requested originally by Attorney General Bob
Butterworth to stave off a pending U.S. Supreme Court review of
whether using Florida's electric chair constitutes cruel and
unusual punishment. Florida is one of only four states that uses
the chair as its sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a special session has grown to encompass more
than a dozen separate ideas, going far beyond a mere switch from
electrocution to lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth asked Bush and lawmakers to pass a law before Jan.
10 _ his deadline for filing his brief with the high court _ to let
him ask the court to declare the electric chair's constitutionality
moot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, though, made it clear he would not call a special session
unless the bill it produced did something to reduce the current
14-year average stay on death row before inmates are put to death,
a figure he said has increased from eight years in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``These statistics point to a system that's not working,'' Bush
said. ``It's wrong. Justice delayed is justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONALITY
</P>
<P>
   Marty McClain, a former state-paid appeals lawyer whose efforts
have put the electric chair under the eye of the U.S. Supreme
Court, said the new changes would in turn bring their own legal
challenges and, hence, even more delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons for all the delays is the legislature every
couple of years makes changes and it takes a couple of years for
the courts to rule on the constitutionality of those changes,''
said McClain, now a capital-case public defender in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the commission appointed by the Supreme Court to
shorten appeals delays, meanwhile, questioned how Bush and
legislators could want to prohibit an inmate from taking newly
discovered evidence to state courts if the inmate has already been
through his state appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal bars all such appeals with the exception of DNA
evidence that might not have been available during the inmate's
original trial.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH CLAIMS AMPLE PROTECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Susan Schaeffer, chief circuit judge in Pinellas County, said
such a blanket prohibition would apply, for instance, to three
eyewitnesses who independently realize they've made a mistake after
seeing the real killer on a ``America's Most Wanted''-type
television program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really think about it, they would not want to deny
actual evidence,'' Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's defenders say inmates with new evidence can still
make a case in federal court. ``We have ample protections for
people on Death Row,'' Bush said.

U.S. EXPELLING RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT IN BUGGING OF STATE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department said Thursday that it had
ordered the expulsion of a Russian diplomat who was apprehended
outside the department's headquarters with electronic equipment for
monitoring a listening device hidden in a conference room used by
senior American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The order to expel Stanislav Borisovich Grusev, an employee of
the Russian Embassy here, came after a long investigation that also
uncovered a tiny sophisticated transmitter on the top floor of the
State Department, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said their investigation had uncovered a
``very aggressive'' Russian intelligence operation that represented
a serious penetration of the State Department. The FBI and the
department are still trying to determine the extent of the damage
to national security from the eavesdropping operation, which may
have been running for months before it was detected early this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the case marked the first time that the
State Department headquarters was known to have been successfully
penetrated with listening devices by a foreign intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   FBI counterintelligence agents detained Grusev on Wednesday in a
public park across the street from the State Department. Grusev,
identified by the federal authorities as an embassy attache, was a
technical expert from the SVR, or Russian foreign intelligence
service, officials said. He was not charged with any crime, and was
quickly turned over to Russian officials after he invoked
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were later directed to remove Grusev from the
United States within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, a senior FBI official in charge of
counterintelligence operations, told reporters at the State
Department that investigators first became suspicious of Grusev
almost by accident early last summer when an FBI surveillance team
working on another case noticed him outside the department. The FBI
agents recognized him from their surveillance of Russian Embassy
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made an observation that Stanislav Grusev was standing in
the vicinity of the State Department, and it took them as a little
bit odd, and they just remembered that very brief observation and
came back and developed a surveillance strategy,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said the FBI had information before Grusev
was detected that led them to suspect a Russian operation was under
way at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, FBI agents watched how Grusev often drove up to the
department, got out of his car and walked around in the surrounding
streets and parks. Gallagher said that Grusev always parked his car
_ with diplomatic license plates _ in the same location, and that
that action had attracted the attention of surveillance agents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Agents documented his movements around the State Department, the
frequency of his visits and the activity surrounding his car, and
concluded that the Russians had planted an electronic eavesdropping
device inside the department. After a search lasting several weeks,
a transmitter that Gallagher said was a ``very sophisticated'' and
``sensitive technical'' piece of espionage equipment was found this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode should be a stark reminder to all of us in
government that despite the thawing of tensions between competing
nations, government facilities and personnel remain a desirable
target for foreign intelligence services,'' Assistant Secretary of
State David Carpenter told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the investigation of Grusev began
months before the recent espionage incidents that evoked the Cold
War practice of retaliatory expulsions. In late November, the
Russian authorities expelled an employee at the American Embassy in
Moscow after they said they had found her carrying spy
paraphernalia, including a device designed to detect signals of
electronic surveillance gear.
</P>
<P>
   And just before that, a Navy enlisted man who had worked at the
super-secret National Security Agency was arrested and charged with
passing secrets to Moscow about American submarine espionage
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they did not know how long ago
the listening device had been installed at the State Department or
who might have planted it. Officials said they had no suspects
under investigation who might have aided the operation from the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials described the potential damage as serious, but it
was unclear what conversations might have been monitored by the
Russians. Officials said that 50 to 100 meetings might have been
held in the conference room since the time that Grusev was thought
to have begun his activities.
</P>
<P>
   Grusev entered the United States in March, but officials said
the listening device could have already been in place by that time.
He may have been sent to Washington to continue an eavesdropping
operation already under way.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the FBI would study the listening device to
look for clues about when it was installed. Officials are also
studying logs of meetings held in the conference room to determine
who had access there.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated eavesdropping device was carefully installed
in a hidden location that was not visible, officials said Thursday.
They said the installation required tools and a high level of
technical skill and could not have been completed in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials theorized that whoever planted the listening device
had probably entered the conference area more than once, and
probably at a time when the State Department allowed authorized
visitors to move throughout the building without an escort. The
department tightened its policy on allowing unescorted visitors in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Grusev's visits to the State Department did not appear to be
timed to eavesdrop on particular meetings, which the officials said
suggested that the Russians did not have inside information in
advance about high-level meetings. The device could work only when
activated from close range, and could not store previously recorded
conversations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was caught, Grusev had hidden in his clothing a remote
switching device that turned on a receiver and tape recorder in his
car and a device designed to detect electronic surveillance
signals.

LIPINSKI BLOSSOMS AS AN ARTIST ON SKATES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, France, Ukraine, Texas)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When she was in seventh grade, Tara Lipinski burst
into big-time figure skating, a 12-year-old jumping jack long on
athleticism but, understandably, undeveloped artistically.
</P>
<P>
   The last five years have brought huge success and change. At 14,
she became figure skating's youngest world and youngest U.S.
champion ever. At 15, she became the sport's youngest Olympic
champion ever. Now, as a 17-year-old professional, she can still do
the jumps beautifully, but the artistic parts of her skating have
indeed become artistic and not just links between jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the best jumper,'' she said in an interview
Thursday. ``I want to become the best skater.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be that already. She has an opportunity to confirm that
Friday and Saturday nights in the Metabolife world pro
championships at the MCI Center. Competing in these championships
for the first time, she will oppose Oksana Baiul of Ukraine, the
1994 Olympic champion; Surya Bonaly of France, three times the
world silver medalist; 36-year-old Denise Biellmann of Switzerland,
the 1981 world champion, and Tonia Kwiatkowski, a member of the
U.S. world team.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable absentee is Michelle Kwan, the American who was
upset by Lipinski for the 1998 Olympic gold medal. Kwan is
retaining her eligibility for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City
by passing up such events as this outside the jurisdiction of the
International Skating Union. Under that body's convoluted rules,
Kwan, ostensibly an amateur, can earn as much money as Lipinski,
and the money is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   After her Olympic triumph, Lipinski turned pro and earned
between $1 million and $2 million for four months on the Stars on
Ice Tour. She will make a similar 70-stop tour starting next month,
and competitions, commercial endorsements and other appearances
bring her perhaps an additional $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski says she likes life much more as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it all, including the tour,'' she said. ``There's not
a lot of pressure. Even though there are a lot of stops, I get home
more often. I used to compete and tour and train and there was
little time for anything else. I still train every day, but it's
not as strenuous, and that helps avoid injuries. I have more time
and no injuries, so I'm doing a lot of competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also doing many things any other 17-year-old would do,
including studying. She is in 12th grade at River Oaks Academy in
Houston, near her family home in Sugar Land, Texas. A tutor travels
with her, and she spends four hours a day studying. She has a
straight-A average.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 1 inch, she weighs 98 pounds and, she says, eats well
and intelligently. At home, she drives her own Corvette. With an
autobiography, a contract as a television actress and appearances
as a favorite television guest, she is a celebrity beyond sport,
but she still seems almost taken aback by public recognition.
</P>
<P>
   People come up and ask, ``Are you Tara Lipinski?'' She responds
with a nod and smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real flattering,'' she said. ``They want an autograph or
just want to say hi.''
</P>
<P>
   The young idealist in her bonds easily with her admirers. The
audience is happy because she is accessible, and it helps that she
is unbeaten in her four major competitions since she turned pro.
Her success, on and off the ice, almost seems a case of too much
too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``Some people can't handle it. I think my
parents prepared me for it. They taught me how to react to people.
If I couldn't handle it, I think my parents would tell me to come
home and go back to school full time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity makes her the female equivalent of Scott
Hamilton, the dynamic 1984 Olympic champion who has become the
darling of figure skating crowds everywhere. She enjoys the
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be remembered for breaking records, for being the
youngest to win some championships,'' she said. ``But I want to be
like Scott. Audiences all over the world love him. I'd like them to
love me like that.''  &QL;

PINCAY TIES SHOEMAKER RECORD WITH 8,833 CAREER WINS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Panama, Calif., Ill . , Ky.)   By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay Jr., riding a horse that had
not won in 11 career starts, reached the winner's circle and the
record books Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, joined Bill Shoemaker atop the list of thoroughbred
racing's winningest jockeys with victory No. 8,833. He won the
fourth race at Hollywood Park aboard the 3-year-old gelding I Be
Casual, who is trained by Jack Van Berg, a fellow member of the
sport's Hall of Fame. Shoemaker had held the record alone since
supplanting John Longden 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very proud,'' Pincay said. ``I just need one more win
and my dream will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay rode in three other races on Thursday's card, finishing
no better than fifth. He has five mounts scheduled for Friday and
six for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   I Be Casual, the 6-5 favorite in the field of nine $25,000
maiden claimers, prevailed by a head in a stretch duel with A J
Flyer. Omar Berrio, riding the runner-up, waved his whip in
celebration of the accomplishment by his fellow Panamanian. Berrio
narrowly defeated Pincay two races earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A mob scene awaited Pincay in the winner's circle. He was
carried to the scales for the postrace weigh-in on the shoulders of
his fellow jockeys. He was handed a Panamanian flag by Berrio for
the winner's circle photo with his family and the wheelchair-bound
Shoemaker, who watched the race on a monitor in the jockeys room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest, in my opinion,'' Shoemaker said. ``He's
climbed to the top of the mountain, but he's got one to go to be
there by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker had held the record since passing Longden with winner
No. 6,033 in 1970. Pincay passed Longden in 1985 and has been
chasing Shoemaker ever since. Shoemaker set his record with 40,350
career rides compared with 44,630 for Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, 46 and still one of the top riders, is third on the
career list with 7,608 winners. He could eventually pass Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, who turns 53 on Dec. 29, rode his first winner in his
native Panama aboard Huelen on May 19, 1964, and was brought to the
United States two years later by the horse owner Fred Hooper to
ride in Chicago. &QL;

SOME IN GOP UNEASY OVER BUSH IN DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many prominent Republicans have concluded that Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas is an unimpressive debater, but they
disagreed over how much that should be a cause for deep concern
among his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans expressed fears that Bush would be no match for
Vice President Al Gore or Bill Bradley in a general election, while
others argued that all that mattered was that the governor not make
any humiliating blunders.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews among Republicans who have endorsed Bush or
who are neutral in the primary thus far, there was overwhelming
agreement on this point: the governor's performance was lackluster
in the debates this week and last week. Even two of Bush's foreign
policy advisers _ speaking anonymously _ expressed concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been the Michael Jordan in the debates,'' said Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio, who withdrew from the presidential race and
endorsed Bush this summer. ``He's not been himself or as
effervescent as he is capable of being. My advice to George Bush is
to keep studying, keep learning, be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries, Kasich said, all that matters is that Bush
avoid a big gaffe. But, counseling that Bush needed some polishing,
he said, ``I have said all along that Al Gore is not to be
underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The critiques are among the first serious questions that have
been raised about the political dexterity of Bush, the Republican
front-runner. Many Republicans had argued that Bush's affable
personality would come across well on television and give him a
crucial advantage over Gore or Bradley should he win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many said that Bush appeared uncharacteristically
awkward on television and that the events raised questions about
his command of the issues. These Republicans also said that Bush's
performance raised questions about whether he had suffered because
of his lack of national campaign seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who is neutral in the race,
said it was ``a terrible mistake'' that Bush did not emerge from
Austin early and begin campaigning and debating. ``I think he took
his lead for granted and that was a mistake,'' Specter said.
Contending that Sen. John McCain of Arizona had appeared more
steady, Specter said, ``McCain's been through a lot of fire. In the
Senate, we make speeches all the time and are in all sorts of
debates. That experience level is an automatic reflex. Governor
Bush doesn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in
1996, said that Bush needs to loosen up in front of the cameras.
``Cramming is not good,'' he said. ``I don't think he ought to have
his head full of facts and figures and statistics. It's more
important to be relaxed and cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabrizio, who was Bob Dole's pollster in the 1996
presidential race and is neutral this time, said he was deeply
worried about Bush's debate skills. ``I'm concerned more for the
general,'' he said. ``Anybody who thinks that Gore is going to be a
pushover in the debates is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debates so far, he said, Bush ``was very repetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I understand that benefit of repeating a message.
But to where it's just rote? You've got to be a little deeper than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the many Republicans interviewed, almost no one was greatly
impressed by Bush. ``Did he score a grand slam home run? No,'' said
Steve Duprey, the Republican chairman in New Hampshire. ``But I
don't think he needed to. What he needed to do was not make a big
error.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher DePino, the Republican party chairman in
Connecticut, described himself as a ``Kool Aid drinking Bushie.''
But he said the affable, charming candidate he knows was not
reflected on television. ``There's a side of this man that is
completely different from his television persona,'' he said. ``In
my opinion, he's very humble. But that does not come across
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning on Thursday in Goffstown, N.H., Bush brushed aside
questions about whether he knew enough to be president. ``I'd
rather be underestimated than overestimated,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast here with reporters on Wednesday, Karl Rove,
Bush's chief strategist, dismissed criticism about his candidate.
``You don't get elected governor unless you've got some great
communication skills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that before last week Bush had only taken part in two
debates _ one when he ran for governor in 1994 and another when he
sought re-election in 1998 _ Rove quipped, ``In the last five days,
Governor Bush has doubled his debate experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rove conceded that Bush's one-on-one appeal does not
always convey well on television. ``Does he come across better when
he's sitting two feet away from you?'' he said. ``You bet. That's
just the nature of what television is all about.''

</P>
<P>
   Two of Bush's foreign affairs advisers were less charitable,
saying that the candidate is not at his best in debates. ``He's
better as a natural guy than in these stylized settings,'' one
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser put it this way, ``He really relates to people,
and he's clearly at his best when he's dealing with small groups.''
The adviser said that Bush needs to figure out whom he is talking
to when he is in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sipple, who for years was a media consultant for Bush, said
the debates have been ``a learning experience'' for the governor
and that he will no doubt improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The format and the stilted nature of these events is something
he will grow accustomed to,'' Sipple said. ``He's got a lot of
strength, a lot of personality traits that will come through as
time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bush supporter, Rich Bond, a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee, said, ``George is playing error-free
ball. And if you're behind in New Hampshire, that's a cautious
strategy. I am not urging boldness upon George at this point. But
if it gets a little more dire between John and he then he may have
to sharpen his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said that although they were not impressed with
Bush's debate skills, they insisted that would not pose an
insurmountable problem for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is not an Adlai Stevenson, intellectually, but neither
was Ronald Reagan, not his father, not even Dwight Eisenhower for
that matter,'' said David Hess, a state representative in New
Hampshire who will back either Bush or McCain. ``The American
people are suspicious of the four-point-0, straight-A guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Sutherland, a Republican national committeeman from
Kansas who is neutral in the primaries, said Bush could never
``live up to his dad's credentials'' and needs ``to get hard-nosed
_ he's going to have to get aggressive going after Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he was optimistic about the governor. ``He's not
Aristotle's philosopher-king,'' Sutherland said. ``But he did a
perfectly workmanlike job. He answered the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said that Bush only has to meet expectations that are
already low. ``He doesn't have to be a super star,'' he said.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was the taping with Jay Leno, the late
dinner at a restaurant bustling with celebrities, the visit to a
Holocaust memorial trailed by an invited pack of television crews,
and the paid speech to 17,000 people at a ``motivational
conference'' in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a political event on the itinerary of Donald
Trump, here to present himself as triumphant developer, new book
author, and the potential next leader of the free world. It was a
cantankerous meeting with leaders of the California Reform Party,
whose support Trump would presumably like should he run for
president. For many, the most memorable moment came when someone
asked if Trump supported the Reform Party platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Trump responded loudly, ``Nobody knows what the Reform
Party platform is.'' As a swell of boos rippled the crowd, a man
stepped forward to offer Trump a copy of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's two-day trip to the West Coast was an exploratory
campaign trip by an exploratory candidate. Yet the visit did little
to settle what has emerged as the fundamental question around his
potential candidacy for the Reform Party nomination: Is he serious?
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Trump has taken a few steps that would suggest
this is something more than an exercise in self-promotion. He has
begun meetings with Reform Party leaders, including the one here on
Monday night, as well as meetings in Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Florida and New York. He has placed on retainer two
signature-gathering companies, which he would need to get on 29
state ballots and become an official contender for the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He has offered a plan to cut taxes, is preparing his own
proposal to provide universal health care and is considering naming
a running-mate early next year.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Trump has yet to do the kind of political spade work
that a candidate for office, or even a potential one, would
customarily have done by this point. His meeting in Beverly Hills
was the only real political event on his short schedule here.
Indeed, Trump suggested that his invitation by Leno and the
$100,000 he was paid for his motivational speech were the real
incentive for flying his black-and-gold private Boeing 727 across
the nation and back.
</P>
<P>
   Trump has yet to hire a campaign staff, and while he says he has
commissioned some polls, he has declined to say who is doing them.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's political travels happen to coincide with a release of a
book, and what at first glance appears to be a campaign pamphlet
turns out, on closer inspection, to a promotional leaflet for the
book.
</P>
<P>
   And as Trump's performance with the Reform Party leaders here
suggested, the developer's command and interest in the details of
running for president sometimes seemed tenuous. Asked to discuss
the idea of a national sales tax, Trump responded: ``How do I feel
about sales tax? I try to avoid paying it whenever possible. But
the idea is an idea that a lot of people like very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing U.S. trade policy, Trump promised to appoint himself
as the nation's trade representative, saying he would have no
trouble serving both in that post and as president. He then
attacked the current holder of the job, Charlene Barshefsky. ``Who
is she?'' demanded Trump. ``I never heard of her!''
</P>
<P>
   And Trump offered an unusual analysis of why he would be a
strong candidate. ``In a three-person race, we need 33 1/3 percent,
a little more, figure 34,'' he said. ``So it's not a very large
percentage in a three-person race.'' In fact, while the analysis
may be correct as a matter of theoretical mathematics, the history
of three-person races suggests that they are never so evenly
divided, with the ultimate winner getting closer to 45 to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The one issue on which Trump was firm was restrictions in
immigration. ``I'm opposed to new people coming in,'' he declared.
``We have to take care of the people who are here.''
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties with the details aside, Trump, a man accustomed
to attention, is luxuriating in what he sees as a cross-country
shower of interest in his potential presidential ambitions. He
raises his hands in a victory salute as he charges onto the set of
the Jay Leno show to the sounds of ``Hail to the Chief.'' He beams
in the glaring television lights as he walks through the solemn
hallways of the Holocaust exhibit in Los Angeles, and camera crews
_ whom he invited to attend _ climb on top of the exhibits to
photograph him.
</P>
<P>
   As he makes his way through the Ivy restaurant, he stops to say
hello first to Rod Stewart and then to Michael Bolton. In arguably
unusual behavior for a White House candidate, he remarks, while
taking questions at the motivational conference, on the clothing
and physical appearances of several women, all young and
attractive, whom he called on for questions.
</P>
<P>
   And, narrating his own voyage, he makes sure to point out how
much attention is being paid to him. ``By the way the camera is `60
Minutes,''' Trump said at the Reform Party meeting here. `Don't
worry about them. It's just a small program on television.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leno inquired how it was going, Trump, responding with
characteristic exaggeration, said: ``Oh, so much press. So much
press out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his dressing room after the interview, Trump
described himself as serious and dismissed the suggestion that this
was a self-promotional lark. ``I'm looking at it seriously,'' he
said. ``Very, very seriously. And a lot of people think I'm pushing
the book. But just remember, I had three No. 1 best sellers. So I
believe this will be a No. 1 best seller, or very close to it, even
if I don't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Should Trump run, he is in a strong position to win the
nomination. The Reform Party is racked by infighting, which Trump
says could allow a newcomer like himself to gain quick advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, party rules permit almost anyone who requests a
ballot to vote on the party's presidential nominee, which Trump's
main adviser, Roger Stone, argues would allow Trump to draw much
support from the clients he has assembled in his gambling and real
estate businesses over the years.
</P>
<P>
   And in a party that is anything but conventional, the notion of
a Trump candidacy is stirring some interest. In New York, Trump has
won the support of the chairman of the New York chapter of the
Reform Party, Jack Essenberg. ``He's a very interesting guy,''
Essenberg said. ``He certainly impressed me with the seriousness of
his candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trump is leaving nothing to chance, attacking, in
particularly brutal terms, his main opponent for the nomination,
Pat Buchanan. (Trump was presumably unaware of the provision in the
Reform Party platform enjoining against attacking opponents.)
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he would only run if he could win, and there are few
professional politicians these days who believe there is much
chance of that. But the New York developer asserts that if he
decides to run, he is prepared to spend $100 million of his own
money _ and while that might not make him president, it could
certainly change the outcome of a three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to toot my own horn, but everybody says two
things about Trump: He's very competent, and he's very rich,''
Trump said. ``That's not so bad. If you have to have two traits, I
mean you might as well have those two.''

POP GOES THE CLASSROOM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   (af)  
 By MARIANNE M. JENNINGS and STEPHEN K. HAPPEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey and her beau, Stedman Graham, teach a course at
Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
Michael Milken has been a guest lecturer in finance courses at
UCLA's Anderson School of Management. There can be little doubt
that Ms. Winfrey, a woman who parlayed her television success into
extensive business interests, and Milken, the king of junk bonds,
have great war stories. They are the stuff that MBAs dreams are
made of.
</P>
<P>
   But while TV stars and tycoons have their place in business
classrooms, they also have their limitations when it comes to
educating students. We have no personal knowledge of what goes on
in their classrooms, but we wonder whether Ms. Winfrey ever
discusses the failure of her last movie, ``Beloved''?
</P>
<P>
   Does Milken discuss the public policy, ethical and corporate
governance issues related to the losses shareholders suffered from
1980s greenmail?
</P>
<P>
   As business school professors for more than two decades, we
confess to a bit of self-preservational wincing over celebrity
faculty members. But we also fear that higher education is being
reduced to little more than a talk-show format.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Ms. Winfrey and Milken would have raised
eyebrows as classroom guest speakers. Now, as the distinction
between pop culture and higher education has become increasingly
muddled, they are conducting class.
</P>
<P>
   As professors, we have witnessed the dumbing-down of the
curriculum, as well as the elimination of general studies,
mathematics and science requirements for a degree. Nowadays, Ms.
Winfrey's MBA course, called ``Dynamics of Leadership,'' sounds
like serious learning next to courses like ``Rock Journalism'' and
``Star Trek and Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Paralleling trends in elementary and secondary schools, higher
education has moved from rigor to fuzziness in teaching techniques.
In the sage-on-the-stage vs. guide-on-the-side debate, the guide
has won, and it is now unchallenged that students learn better from
one another in groups as faculty stroll among them. Yet imagine
Milton Friedman teaching a class in which students form discussion
groups while he just ambles about, asking whether there are any
questions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, higher education is taking on characteristics that are
very familiar to Generation X and their baby brothers and sisters,
the Echo Boomers. Much like the dragons and dungeons encountered in
these students' video games, higher education has become an
obstacle to be bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to find a way to morph to the next world, complete
with credentials, so that you move directly to the bonuses and
rewards without enduring the challenges of the present.
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are making that morphing easier. Taking Peter
Drucker's ``universities without walls'' to the max, they are
becoming clearinghouses for self-generated studies and stages for
star appearances. They offer cyberspace and satellite courses. They
grant credit for life's work. Soon, deans will be able to hawk
their business schools as if they were selling cars: ``I can grant
that degree in 180 days or the fee's on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But a classic education takes time _ and demands creativity. The
ability to plug models into a computer is not the same as the
ability to develop the model itself. That requires creativity,
innovation and training to outlast trends.
</P>
<P>
   Through all their new shortcuts, including the granting of
credentials for communing with the Internet, business schools may
indeed ease the path for students who have spent a lifetime in
front of some form of screen. And who better to grace the screen
than a TV star with great stories?
</P>
<P>
   Pop culture and education are one; the morphing will soon be
complete. &QL;

POLICE OFFICERS ACCUSED IN DIALLO KILLING WILL PUT THEIR
CREDIBILITY ON TRIAL

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four police officers accused of murder in the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo plan to testify in their own
defense at their trial next month and are leaning toward choosing a
trial by a judge instead of a jury, according to their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of the officers, and its credibility, will be
focal points of the trial because there were no other witnesses to
the initial encounter in February between Diallo, a West African
immigrant, and the plainclothes officers who killed him in a
fusillade of 41 bullets. The shooting came to crystallize the
debate over the Police Department's aggressive tactics in cracking
down on crime, especially in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have said through their lawyers that they
mistakenly thought that Diallo, an unarmed street peddler with no
criminal record, was reaching for a gun. But they have not spoken
publicly about the incident, they declined to appear before the
grand jury and they were not debriefed by their superiors. So even
after weeks of protests and months of often angry argument, the
only version of what the officers say happened in the vestibule of
Diallo's Bronx apartment building last Feb. 4 has been the largely
generic account offered by their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's office has also had little to say
about the case since the officers were indicted on second-degree
murder charges in March. But prosecutors and the defense have spent
months compiling evidence for the trial, which is scheduled to
begin Jan. 3, as well as debating whether an impartial jury can be
picked in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A review of much of that evidence, including witness statements,
crime- scene videotapes and forensic analyses, reveals a much more
sharply defined picture of the incident and underscores what are
likely to be the critical contested issues at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also includes details of the early-morning shooting
and the investigation that were not previously known, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   One witness to the end of the shooting told investigators that
one of the officers was ducking as if he thought he was being fired
upon.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness said that after the shooting, she heard an
unidentified officer remark, ``This is what we are going to say,''
a statement that could be used to undermine the credibility of the
officers' accounts at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for one of the officers said there was no evidence that
the witness was referring to one of the four officers.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also shows that investigators spent weeks
unsuccessfully pursuing a tip that Diallo may have been unusually
fearful on the night he was shot because he had been told about
another peddler who was robbed by men in plainclothes with shields
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   And the medical examiner who did the autopsy told investigators
he believed Diallo was felled by one of the first of the 19 shots
that hit him, a conclusion the defense will try to rebut.
</P>
<P>
   Although the course of the trial remains undetermined,
interviews and the evidence reviewed by The New York Times indicate
that the case will largely focus on three unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   One issue will be the question of when Diallo was incapacitated
by his wounds. The defense and the prosecution are expected to
present conflicting analyses of whether Diallo was felled by one of
the earlier bullets that hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Another will be the question of how long it took the officers to
fire 41 shots. The shorter the duration, the easier it will be for
the officers to argue that the encounter happened too fast for them
to recognize their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And then there will be the matter of whether there was a pause
in the firing. Seven witnesses have told investigators that they
heard a pause after the initial shots. Prosecutors are expected to
argue that the pause gave the officers a clear opportunity to
realize that Diallo did not pose a threat.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution were to show that Diallo was felled by an
early shot, or that the officers continued to fire after a
significant pause when it was clear he was not a threat, it would
help the argument that the officers had shown a depraved
indifference to human life, as outlined in the charge of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case is already the most closely watched police
shooting of the decade because the debate has gone beyond the
question of whether the officers, all members of an elite Street
Crime Unit known for its aggressive tactics, committed a crime.
Instead, the debate has evolved into an argument between those who
applaud the obvious success of the city's gung-ho crime-fighting
strategies and those who say the success was obtained through a
reckless trampling of civil rights, especially those of minorities.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers cited the politically charged atmosphere of the
case in court papers last month, when they indicated they were
likely to select a bench trial because they said it might be
impossible to pick an impartial jury. ``We are not afraid of the
law, we are not afraid of the facts, but we are afraid of the
politics,'' said Stephen Worth, the lawyer for Officer Edward
McMellon.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit, which searches thousands of unarmed
people a year as part of its mission to seize illegal guns, is at
the heart of the controversy. Many officers say they believe they
are expected to seize at least one gun a month, although police
officials say the unit does not have a quota.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, during the 15-month period that ended in March, police
officers stopped 56,499 people on suspicion of carrying a weapon
but found a weapon only 2.6 percent of the time, according to the
state attorney general's office. How the propensity by officers to
suspect a weapon, even when none exists, colors their judgment
during potentially deadly, split-second encounters is likely to
become an issue at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, records filled out by several of the officers in the
Diallo case show they had often stopped people on the mistaken
assumption they were carrying a gun. Officer Sean Carroll, for
example, in the six weeks before the shooting, stopped men in six
separate encounters who had no weapon, according to documents from
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's perceptions are particularly critical because it is
he, according to his lawyers, who mistakenly yelled ``gun'' when,
the lawyers say, Diallo pulled out his wallet. One witness has said
she also heard an officer yell ``gun'' as the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest evidence I have is my client and his
testimony,'' said Carroll's lawyer, John Patten. ``He will tell
exactly what he observed, what he reacted to and what he felt.''
</P>
<P>
   If the officers' stated belief that Diallo had a gun _ although
mistaken _ is held to be reasonable, then, under the law, their use
of deadly force could have been justified. But there are many
facets to such a finding, including the question of whether the
belief of danger they might have held as the shooting began was
still a reasonable one by the time the 41st bullet was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say that the fact that most of the police
force's encounters with suspected gun holders do not end in gunfire
bolsters their contention that in the Diallo incident the victim
did several things that contributed to the shooting, like ignoring
a command to freeze. The lawyers, however, have refused to provide
a detailed description of what they say were Diallo's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what was taking place in front of him, what he heard
and what he saw,'' said James Culleton, the lawyer for Officer
Richard Murphy, ``his actions seemed completely reasonable. He
thought he was about to be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the shooting, Diallo started home from 14th
Street in Manhattan, where he sold videos, at 11 p.m., according to
a Metrocard found in his wallet. At 11:55, when one of his
roommates came home, Diallo was on the couch in his apartment at
1157 Wheeler Avenue, watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes later, another witness mentioned seeing Diallo
walking down the block. About 12:20 a.m., another witness reported
seeing a man standing in the doorway of Diallo's building, peering
up and down the street suspiciously. But he said the man wore a
green hat. Diallo wore a red knit Yankees hat that night.
</P>
<P>
   The officers pulled onto that block of Wheeler Avenue about
12:40 a.m. Many accounts have had them searching for a rapist that
night, but a commander told investigators that their primary
mission was to look for suspects in a pattern of robberies and
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have said through their lawyers that they spotted
Diallo, 22, in the doorway of his building as their unmarked red
Ford Taurus passed by. According to the officers' account, Diallo
receded into the shadows, then peered out after them, suspiciously,
so the officers backed up the car to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and McMellon got out first and approached. Witness
accounts differ on whether the vestibule, with its two overhead
fixtures, was well lighted or dark that night, and what happened
next remains unclear. The officers _ their shields dangling from
their necks, according to one witness _ have said they identified
themselves and told Diallo to freeze, but that he made a sudden
movement toward his waist and they fired. The officers, who are
waging a joint defense, have not indicated who fired the first
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner who performed the autopsy, Dr. Joseph
Cohen, concluded that one of first shots hit Diallo in the aorta,
critically wounding and felling him. ``The victim was definitely
rendered incapacitated, possibly after the first or the first
several shots,'' Cohen told Detective Mark Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he believed that Diallo ``was down or going down
before the end of the first several rounds fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance personnel noted a slight loss of blood when they
arrived, a fact that the medical examiner considered in concluding
that the aorta had been hit by an early shot, thereby reducing
Diallo's blood pressure. Investigators have not determined who
fired that shot.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team has said that any suggestion about the sequence
of shots is unfounded speculation. Officers are trained to shoot
until they have stopped a potentially deadly suspect. The officers
have maintained, through their lawyers, that Diallo stayed upright
as most of the 19 bullets hit him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officers' account, Murphy and Officer Kenneth
Boss followed McMellon and Carroll toward the stoop. At one point,
the officers' lawyers have said, McMellon slipped and fell back,
creating the impression he had been shot. Carroll told a doctor
that night that he, too, fell while scrambling away from Diallo,
who he believed had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Seven witnesses have told investigators there was a pause in the
firing. Edward Martinez said he was watching TV when he heard the
shots. ``Three shots and then a pause,'' he recounted, ``and then
there was a barrage of firing.'' He estimated the pause lasted two
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The defense contends there was no pause, citing accounts of
other witnesses who did not hear one. The defense has argued that
the semiautomatic pistols the officers used can fire so fast _ 16
rounds in less than six seconds _ that the officers had no chance
to catch themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of the time line for the shooting are known. The
first 911 call came in at 12:41 a.m., from a woman who reported
hearing gunshots. Thirty seconds later the shooting is clearly
over, as Boss gets on the radio to request ``a bus and a boss,''
police parlance for an ambulance and a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   When the supervisors arrived they found Diallo sprawled on the
vestibule floor. He had never said a word, according to the
officers' account.
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene video made by investigators shows Diallo on the
floor, his left leg crossed over his right, wearing a blue and
white windbreaker, black jeans and sneakers without socks. His
beeper and wallet are near his outstretched right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported a sad, stunned aftermath. Two recalled how
one officer just kept pacing back and forth. Then, one of the
witnesses said, ``he threw his cap to the ground and was shaking in
the street.''

 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced Thursday that he
would sue to obtain a spot in New York's presidential primary,
contending that the state party had laid down a thicket of election
rules to ensure that its preferred candidate, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, goes unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, to be filed in federal court, would seek places on
the primary ballot for all widely recognized candidates, McCain
said. He also called on Bush, Gov. George Pataki of New York and
the state party to disavow the rules, which have long been a magnet
for criticism, and immediately help the other contenders get on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that no other state made it so difficult for
presidential candidates to enter primaries, and he recalled that
similar legal action pried open the 1996 Republican primary in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Republicans in New York should have a real
choice,'' he said. ``It's not any more complicated than that.
Elections should be decided by the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a news conference at New York University Law School
with his state campaign chairman, Guy Molinari, Staten Island
borough president, and two lawyers, Burt Neuborne and Richard
Emery, who brought the 1996 case and plan to represent McCain in
the new lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush and Pataki, who is the party leader and Bush's
biggest champion in the state, dismissed McCain's comments, saying
that the rules had been loosened for this election and were
entirely fair. They said a candidate with respectable support
should have no trouble getting on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Molinari said that they had hoped to obtain a ballot
spot in some parts of the state, but that the petitioning process
was so arduous that there was little chance of getting on statewide
for the primary, to be held March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Republicans _ Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
and Alan Keyes _ are expected to pass up the primary because they
believe they will not be able to comply. A fourth, Steve Forbes,
the millionaire publisher, vows to spend $750,000 to get on the
ballot. All four may eventually join the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The rules in most other states are as basic as New York's are
complex. Several states, including California, automatically give
spots to candidates with national recognition. In some states, all
that is required to enter is a filing fee.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republicans are required to gather signatures of
party members on petitions in all 31 congressional districts in the
state, with the level ranging from 82 to 890 for each district,
depending on the number of registered voters. The petitions are
often challenged by front-runners, which means exhaustive and
expensive legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, federal judges, ruling on a lawsuit in which Forbes was
a plaintiff, decided that the system was too burdensome and ordered
him to be put on the ballot across the state. After that primary,
Pataki pushed through changes that reduced some of the technical
requirements in the petitioning process and lowered the number of
signatures necessary to qualify in each district.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Bush's rivals assert that the changes are just
tinkering, saying that campaigns are still required to set up an
expensive statewide operation to collect signatures in each
district.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have a similar system, though in one respect it is
somewhat easier. Campaigns that do not want to collect signatures
in all the districts can gather 5,000 signatures statewide,
including some in at least half the districts. Both major
Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, are expected to be on the ballot statewide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki and Bush have declined to say whether the Bush
campaign and the state party will seek to have the McCain or Forbes
petitions disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why anyone can't get on the ballot if they
really want to get on the ballot,'' Michael McKeon, a spokesman for
Pataki, said Thursday.

AILING SHIPYARD ON GUAM PROMPTS CLASH BETWEEN NAVY AND CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Md., Hawaii, Ill., Iowa, Guam)  (lh) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years ago, Congress agreed with the Pentagon
and a federal base-closing commission to shut a Navy shipyard in
Guam to save $172 million by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Now many lawmakers from both parties and even some Navy officers
fear that they may have made a big mistake, one that could
ultimately cost the United States control of a vital repair site
strategically situated near areas of potential trouble in Asia like
East Timor or Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting move seemed smart in 1995 because it would keep
in sync with a shrinking post-Cold War Navy, but its unintended
consequences have drawn sharp fire on Capitol Hill. Members of
Congress and officials in Guam say the Navy is undermining a plan
to help preserve jobs on the island and protect U.S. interests,
carried out by leasing the shipyard to a private American operator
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Navy is circumventing a law requiring
that U.S. ships be repaired in U.S. shipyards, including Guam,
except in emergencies. Navy officials say its five ammunition and
supply ships operating out of Guam are exempt from the law and can
be overhauled at cheaper, more convenient shipyards in South Korea
or Singapore. Without that work, however, the Guam shipyard may be
forced to close or surrender its lease to a foreign rival.
</P>
<P>
   Facing that prospect, an unusual alliance of pro-labor Democrats
and Republican defense hawks are pressing the Navy to reverse
course and comply with the law as the lawmakers interpret it. Their
ranks include Reps. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
Democrat in the House, and Robert Ehrlich, R-Md., who is a close
ally of Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Joining them are some
powerful Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee,
including Daniel Inouye of Hawaii and Tom Harkin of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin recently wrote Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, saying that
his visit to the island last August underscored ``the unique
strategic role Guam may play as a forward deployment option for the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably,'' he added, ``current policies being implemented
by the Navy are inhibiting, rather than promoting, this
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this fight is Adm. James Lyons Jr., a
blunt-spoken retired commander of the Pacific Fleet who is the
chief executive of Guam Industrial Services, which runs the
shipyard. Lyons is lobbying his broad network of connections in the
Navy and in Congress to save his financially troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the uncertainty in China and Korea, the Navy is doing
everything they can to close us down,'' Lyons said. ``The
difference here is a few million bucks to keep open an important
strategic facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy agrees, up to a point. ``We do need a repair capability
there,'' said Michael Hammes, deputy assistant secretary of the
Navy for ship programs. ``It's a question of how much capability.''
</P>
<P>
   When the United States closed the Subic Bay military base in the
Philippines in 1992, the Navy lost its premier shipyard in the
Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, leaving the 100-acre shipyard in
Guam as its westernmost repair site in the Pacific. It formed a
part of a major military installation that now includes an air
base, a Navy ammunition depot, a hospital and a support unit for
Navy special operations teams. As one of Guam's largest private
employers, the shipyard has had a work force as high as 325 people
since the Navy pulled out; it now hovers at around 150.
</P>
<P>
   Navy warships undergo repairs at U.S. shipyards at the end of
their six-month sea tours. But more than 30 support ships operated
by the Military Sealift Command deploy for nearly a year at a time,
and must be able to steam into foreign ports for repairs rather
than make the time-consuming trips back to the United States, Navy
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Navy does not assign the support ships to a
domestic home port, calling them simply ``forward deployed,'' a
technical but important distinction because the ship repair law
covers only those vessels formally based on Guam or in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin complained that the Navy's interpretation ``is contrary
to both the letter and spirit of the law, and must be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials say they have gone out of their way to help
smooth Guam's transition from a government shipyard to a private
one. The Navy agreed in 1997 to steer $25 million in work over two
years to help the shipyard get on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   But to break even, the shipyard needs about $20 million of work
a year, Lyons said. When it comes to attracting the commercial work
to make up the difference, Guam has several disadvantages. For one
thing, it is off the beaten path of major shipping lines. Repair
costs in Guam, while in line with those on the West Coast, are 25
to 70 percent higher than at Asian shipyards.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is trying to overcome perceptions that the shipyard has
failed to market itself aggressively. But Guam officials are
threatening to lease the shipyard to another company if it cannot
sustain a large enough work force.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials say they are in a bind. ``Guam is a pivotal
location and a hedge against the future,'' Adm. Thomas B. Fargo,
commander of the Pacific Fleet, said in a telephone interview.
``It'll take a mixture of Navy and commercial work to sustain it at
a steady state level.''
</P>
<P>
   But Navy budget experts are wary of pouring more subsidies into
a financially shaky shipyard, even if it has a strategic mission.
``They need a graceful transition, but we've provided two years of
that already,'' said Hammes, the Navy's ship programs official.

 Firms Leery of Getting Paid With Paper  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The story has taken on almost mythic status among advertising
agencies in San Francisco. Some of the wilder rumors are
exaggerated but, yes, Black Rocket agency once had a chance to get
pre-IPO stock options in Yahoo at what its CEO calls ``extremely
favorable prices.''
<P>
   But Black Rocket turned down the offer, opting for cash up front
to handle Yahoo advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, that's true,'' John Yost, head of Black Rocket,
said. ``I wish I'd been able to see clearer, but at that time, we
were just getting started and we needed computers and desks more
than we needed options on somebody's stock.''
</P>
<P>
   For every Yahoo that offers options in lieu of payment to
advertising agencies, landlords, executive recruiters, accountants
and even caterers, there are many Internet startups whose options
turn out to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Equity-based compensation is a risk many businesspeople can't
afford to take. Others see it as something of a barter system.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Cederblom, an executive recruiter in San Rafael, says he is
willing to work for stock options provided the company's prospects
look promising. But Cederblom said he, too, has options so
worthless they could be used for scratch paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking options in lieu of cash is a gamble,'' he said. ``There
were three companies I did that with that didn't make anything. In
two of the cases, the companies didn't get funded. The other one
just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cederblom said it makes sense, sometimes, for executive
recruiters to take options in lieu of cash because it makes the
recruiter a quasi-employee of the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've done these projects, it's like retaining a permanent
adviser, knowing I've got a vested interest in that company,'' he
said. ``I'll get them a VP of marketing, but I'll also introduce
them to (an) ad agency and other executives. I've got five deals
like that pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses find the risk-to-reward ratio too heavy on the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Buechert, director of the Leagas Delaney advertising
agency in San Francisco, says he often turns down option offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're against stock options,'' Buechert said.
``We do have arrangements, but it's under a very judicious policy.
We have to have faith in their business model, financing and
executive group. You're not buying into a company when you accept
options; you're buying into the possibility of a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We insist our costs are covered with cash, actual American
currency. ... But I am willing to take a certain percentage of
profit margin in stock option, taking a flier when it seems
right.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the option deals Leagas Delaney has entered into has
paid off _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because the companies are so young,'' Buechert said.
``It remains to be seen. But if it hits, the upside is tremendous.
Everyone in the industry knows about the Yahoo-and-Black-Rocket
story. Lurking in everyone's head is, if just one company with
options becomes a success, it makes all the risks worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Yost of Black Rocket says his agency has only accepted stock
options with one Internet client.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much uncertainty in it,'' Yost said. ``It's hard to
pick which will be the winners and losers. Sometimes, the most
interesting advertising clients are not necessarily the hottest
IPOs. But then, there are cases like Yahoo. We don't have any sour
feelings about not taking options with Yahoo. We're just delighted
to get the account. It's been a good partnership.''

REFORMS ARE ON IOC AGENDA, BUT BIG CHANGES ARE NOT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Even if the International Olympic
Committee enacted all 50 of its proposed reforms at meetings here
this weekend, many Olympic observers do not expect the group to
change in more than an incremental way in the aftermath of the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of the scandal, which was disclosed a year ago,
was underscored Thursday when Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC
president, said through a spokesman that he would agree to a
``voluntary interview'' with the U.S. Justice Department sometime
after he testifies before Congress in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, by agreeing to later questioning, Samaranch avoided
the embarrassment of being subpoenaed when he arrived in
Washington. The continuing Justice Department investigation has so
far resulted in two indictments related to a sham job arranged by
Salt Lake City bidders for the son of a prominent IOC member from
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an important weekend for Samaranch, who is certain
to face hostile questioning on Capitol Hill about IOC business
practices if he cannot show proof of significant reforms when he
appears next week before the House Commerce Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, chaired by Rep. Fred Upton, the
Michigan Republican. The IOC is being threatened with a loss of its
tax-exempt status and the withholding of television rights fees
unless it enacts major reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be damaging if it falls apart,'' said Anita DeFrantz
of the United States, a vice president of the IOC. Speculation that
Samaranch would resign after this weekend's reform package was
pushed through has persisted, but he has said that he will fill out
his term, which ends next year.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz defended the IOC's reform movement, pointing to the
creation of an ethics commission and a worldwide doping agency, to
the opening of meetings to reporters and to the public issuance of
financial reports. ``We had a crisis and we took the opportunity to
make much-needed changes,'' DeFrantz said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the IOC meets to consider reforms, however, questions
continue to be raised about how much DeFrantz knew about the
bidding practices in Salt Lake City and corruption within the IOC.
A copy of a report written by Salt Lake City bid officials after
they attended an IOC meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Aug. 25
to Sept. 1, 1989, stated that one of the officials, Bennie Smith,
had spoken with DeFrantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``She suggested we not base everything on what Ganga says,'' the
report said. ``Ganga is very political and he is the kind of guy
that wants to know how his hand will be greased. He is not
trustable.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was written a full decade before Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Congo Republic was removed from the IOC this year after
accepting more than $250,000 in illicit support from Salt Lake City
bid officials. One of those officials, Dave Johnson, has insisted
publicly that DeFrantz knew about the scholarship program and other
inducements, but she has vehemently denied it.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no recollection of making such remarks to
Smith. ``I wouldn't have said that,'' she said. ``What nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the IOC proposals to be voted on this weekend are not
what they seem. For instance, term limits for its members are not
term limits at all. It is proposed that IOC members be limited to
eight-year terms, but those terms would be renewable by peer
election to the age of 80 for current members, and to 70 for
members elected in the future. Depending on how the 102 current
members vote, any future IOC president could remain in office for
up to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits that are infinitely renewable are not term
limits,'' said Jeff Benz, a San Francisco lawyer who served on the
panel headed by the former Sen. George Mitchell that investigated
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. ``I am convinced they are only
willing to do the minimum necessary to get through the current
crisis and that the real proof will be in how they implement those
reforms they are considering.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the potential chance for fireworks among committee
members this weekend if a revolt occurs against the most
controversial proposal favored by Samaranch _ that members not be
allowed to visit cities bidding on the Winter and Summer Games. A
panel of experts would assess the bids, which would be put to a
vote by the membership.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials plied visiting members and their
families with millions of dollars in cash payments, scholarships,
medical treatment, and shopping sprees in its effort to secure the
2002 Winter Games. Ten IOC members were removed or quit as the
scandal unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the reform package to be voted on this weekend
concerns the issue of doping. The IOC has caused much skepticism
with its doping reform package. It is proposing to throw out of the
Olympics any sports that do not comply with worldwide testing and
punishment standards. However, sports such as soccer, tennis and
cycling have long ignored IOC guidelines. In recent weeks, the
track and field federations in Cuba and Jamaica have declined to
suspend athletes who have tested positive for cocaine and the
steroid nandralone.
</P>
<P>
   The World Anti-Doping Agency, which the IOC recently set up,
raised questions about its legitimacy with the appointment to its
board of Hein Zerbruggen, president of the International Cycling
Union, which has become one of the most discredited sports
federations in the wake of the Tour de France doping scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor who is an expert on
performance-enhancing drugs, said that if the IOC eliminated drug
use, sponsors and fans may not be interested in watching races in
which records were no longer being broken. Yesalis and many others
have criticized the IOC for being decades and tens of millions of
dollars behind in anti-doping research. The IOC's current proposals
are ``smoke and mirrors,'' Yesalis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of putting wax on Lenin's body,'' Yesalis said.
``It's pretty well decayed.'' &QL;

JAPAN DROPS ROCKET PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS rocket name to `H-2' sted `H-II' thruout) 
 (rk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the latest setback for the Japanese space program,
the space agency said Thursday that it would abandon its troubled
H-2 rocket project, the cornerstone of the program, after a series
of costly failures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will delay the launchings of almost all Japanese
satellites for about a year and follows the failed launching last
month of the No. 8 H-2 rocket, which plunged into the Pacific
shortly after takeoff because of engine trouble. In developing the
rocket, Japan sought to free itself from the restrictions that came
with relying on the United States for rocket technology, and to
compete in the commercial satellite-launching market.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Space Development Agency said it would
immediately halt production of the No. 7 H-2 rocket, which is 90
percent complete at a cost of $160 million. The No. 7 rocket, which
despite its designation was the last in the H-2 series, had been
scheduled for launching with a communications satellite next year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it would focus on the next generation of rocket,
H-2A, which it said would benefit from past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has invested $4.14 billion in the H-2 program, which
began in 1986, including $2.7 billion for development and $180
million for each launching.
</P>
<P>
   An aerospace analyst, Fujio Nakano, said the decision to shift
focus to the H-2A was a good idea. ``With the past H-2 launches,''
Nakano said, ``we have already accumulated much valuable
information that can be used in designing the new rocket model.
Considering that this is an investment toward the next-generation
rocket technology, 16 billion yen is a small loss.''
</P>
<P>
   That total equals $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of the space effort was severely damaged on Nov.
15, when the No. 8 H-2 rocket, carrying a government satellite,
plunged into the ocean after the first-stage engine stopped firing.
That was the second H-2 rocket failure in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The lost rocket and satellite were valued at $340 million. The
agency has not determined the cause of the failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are still investigating the accident, we decided,
considering the cost involved, that we should cancel the No. 7 H-2
and apply the savings and what we learn from the investigation to
ensuring a successful launching of the H-2A,'' said a spokesman for
the agency, Yasukuki Fukumuro.
</P>
<P>
   Fukumuro said the agency would save $30 million by devoting its
efforts solely to developing the H-2A, which he said has a more
advanced engine and more power than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had planned the initial H-2A launching for early next
year. But its debut will be delayed for a year to conduct
additional ground tests, the agency said. The postponement, along
with the cancellation of the No. 7 H-2, will push back the
launching of almost every satellite for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it planned to launch the first and second H-2A
rockets, which are scheduled to carry a European Space Agency
communications satellite and Japanese military satellite, in the
summer and winter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Fukumuro said if the initial H-2A launchings were successful,
the agency hoped to transfer the technology to the private sector
to fulfill the long-term goal of launching commercial satellites.
To be competitive, the Japanese plan to offer customers steep
discounts on launchings and build a reputation for reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The highly competitive launching industry is dominated by three
major players, Boeing's Delta rockets and Lockheed Martin's Atlas
rockets, both from the United States, and Ariane rockets made by
Arianespace, the European consortium. Russia and China have small
parts of the market.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Losing the Startup Gamble  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   It's lunchtime at South Park, that splash of green in the heart
of Multimedia Gulch where young high-tech high rollers hang out
when not building their dot-com empires.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Pierre, two late-20s Web masters at an e-commerce
startup, dig their Doc Martins into the sand and rummage in their
brown bags for their sandwiches. They are, naturally, musing on
stock options _ the coin of the Internet realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got burned at this other (startup),'' Mike says. ``They had
a reverse split and reissued my stock at a quarter of the worth. It
decreased to the point it wasn't worth much. You take that
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but I still would never work at a place where I didn't
have options,'' Pierre says, ``where you're not, you know, a part
owner of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Mike says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these two software engineers might want to go to Redwood
City and consult with Michael Suever, 41, a veteran of three failed
Internet startup ventures who finally has opted for the relative
security of employment at Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough worthless stock options around to wallpaper two
outhouses,'' Suever said. ``I guess I've gotten really cynical
about it. Or, maybe just realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Suever is not alone. In fact, he's part of the silent majority
of high-tech workers whose dreams of vast stock-option wealth waned
when their startups fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   According to Internet Week magazine, only 220 of the thousands
of Internet companies are publicly traded. Numerous surveys have
shown that 70 percent of startups don't even make it to an IPO, and
Ernst &AMP; Young reports that slightly fewer than 50 percent of
Silicon Valley companies ever show a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge gamble,'' said Erik Cederblom, an executive
recruiter from San Rafael. ``For every company that gets started,
only about 1 in 10 gets funded or reaches an IPO. Of those, not
that many make people lots of money off options. But, still, all we
hear about is dot-coms going from zero to megabucks mega-bucks &LR; 
 &LR; overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   If workers are fortunate enough to land at the right firm at the
right time, they do, in fact, reach the megabuck level. Cisco
Systems has estimated that it has minted 2,000 millionaires among
its 19,000 employees. Netscape, Intel and eBay also have been
high-profile stock-option success stories for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Suever's wife, Naomi Chavez, was a winner in the options
sweepstakes, having joined Intel early enough to get many options
at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good timing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More typical is Kim Statz of Petaluma, who in 1992 was the fifth
person hired at a nascent software firm specializing in e-mail. She
worked for well below the base salary most operations managers
make. The hours were long, the conditions sometimes dreary. The
company, she said, started out of the founder's living room before
eventually moving to San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   But Statz had stock options _ thousands of them _ equal to 1
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working there until 2 in the morning,'' Statz said. ``We
all did. All we were thinking was going IPO and, of course, we all
had dollar signs in our eyes. It seemed a really good risk to take.
In fact, back then, I didn't think it was a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, just as the company was nearing its IPO, the founder
sold the business to a larger hardware firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founder walked away with about $15 million, but we didn't
get much. Basically, it was like a severence package _ cash and
stock in the other company. But that new company's stock price was
always around $5 (per share), so it wasn't a windfall for all that
work we put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Statz says she is not soured on the idea of stock
options, since acquaintances of hers have hit it big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just knowing what company to be at at the right time,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Suever, the three-time options loser, used to believe that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, Suever moved to the Bay Area to work for
Hewlett-Packard as a software engineer specializing in video
servers and digital cable equipment. He was 27 then, hadn't heard
of stock options and wasn't offered any.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in this business, there was a whole different
attitude,'' Suever said. ``There was loyalty to a company. I was
really comfortable at HP.''
</P>
<P>
   But Suever was ambitious. He had plans. While working at HP, he
earned an MBA in marketing. And, in the mid-90s, when HP decided to
stop pursuing the video server field, Suever thought it was time to
plunge into a startup.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, he definitely knew what stock options were.
</P>
<P>
   DiviCom, a pre-IPO digital video networking company, offered
Suever the two things he wanted most _ about 20,000 stock options
and a career in marketing. He had barely been there six months when
the company was acquired by C-Cube Microsystems, which proceeded to
pull a reverse stock split in which seven DiviCom options equaled
one C-Cube option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed two years and made a grand total of $20,000 (in
options profit), after taxes,'' Suever said. ``But when I think
about it, I lost in the long run. Because when I left HP for
DiviCom, I gave up $10,000 in HP contributions to my 401(k). And I
lost my HP vacation time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Suever wanted another chance at stock-option gold. In 1997,
he took another cut in base pay and went to Optivision Inc., a Palo
Alto provider of image compression hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real risk, because the company wasn't profitable and
it had less than 100 employees,'' Suever said. ``But my wife's
success at Intel gave me the freedom to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Suever survived several rounds of layoffs at Optivision, saw
that the company had no prospects for an IPO and decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he found a more promising spot as a product
manager for N-Cube, a provider of interactive servers and digital
video management solutions. Options awaited Suever again, but this
time he had a more realistic view of his chances for great wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only there three months when Cisco called me for a
digital video job I was seeking,'' Suever said. ``I couldn't really
turn it down. It was a job written right off my resume.''
</P>
<P>
   The job at Cisco doesn't afford Suever a stock-option windfall.
But it does provide a few stock options and other perks, such as
child care for his son, stability and a chance to carpool car-pool
 &LR; to work with his wife, who now works as a leadership training
manager at Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm maybe too old now to go after the options gamble,'' Suever
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lessard, 37, also needed to get burned a few times before
wising up to the options gamble. Lessard worked for seven companies
in seven years before chucking it all to start his own Web site for
worker complaints and co-authoring a book with Steve Baldwin called
``NetSlaves: True Tales of Working on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessard believes naive young engineers are exploited by
entrepreneurs who use options as a way to pay poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids hear all about the Microsoft millionaires and they
figure they'll get it, too, no problem,'' Lessard said. ``It's just
a carrot-on-a-stick thing. We get complaints on our Website  &LR; Web
site all the time about kids getting eaten up by entrepreneurs, and
the media is complicit. It makes IPOs sexy. The CEO has taken the
place of the rock star, with CNBC replacing MTV. Then you see these
Net net  &LR; slaves literally sleeping on cots in their cubicles and
working their butts off for options when, in the final analysis,
they'd be better off with 401ks &LR;   &LR; 401(k)s.''
</P>
<P>
   To work at a pre-IPO company, Suever says, you have to be young
and have tremendous drive, stamina and a single-minded approach to
the task at hand. ``It was something fun to experiment with when I
was younger,'' he said. ``But I just can't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all 40-year-olds are as stock-option wary as Suever and
Lessard.
</P>
<P>
   Romain Agostini, 40, quit his position as the network
administrator at Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center
after 10 years to become a business development engineer with
ClickNet Software in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk-reward thing for me,'' Agostini said. ``I'm taking
the chance that, down the road, stock options might make me rich.
But you put up with longer hours and the hectic environment. I miss
the excellent benefits and salary at Stanford _ and the vacation
time, too. But this company might go public next year if things go
well. I may be older than your usual Silicon Valley job-hopper, but
can't old guys be one of the few who get rich, too?''

 Weisel in Talks to Sell Stake _ $100 Million  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Thomas Weisel Partners, the San Francisco investment bank started a
year ago by the former chief executive of Montgomery Securities, is
in talks to sell a 10 percent stake to a major financial
institution for $100 million, people with knowledge of the matter
said.
<P>
   The investment by the unidentified partner would value the firm
at $1 billion, twice its initial worth and not far from the $1.3
billion Weisel got for Montgomery Securities, a firm it took him
nearly three decades to build before he sold it to North Carolina's
NationsBank in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are said to be advanced, but no information was available
on when an agreement might be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The new investor has also agreed to put as much as $1 billion
into several private investment funds organized by Weisel Partners,
according to the online business news service TheStreet.com, which
first reported the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the $1 billion value for Weisel Partners, a firm
with $65 million in capital and projected 1999 revenue of $150
million, astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   The high price for the stake in Weisel Partners, which sells
securities for and provides merger advice to fast-growing companies
in technology and other sectors, reflects intense buyer demand for
securities firms that have a strong position in the superheated
Internet and technology initial-public-offering market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is mind-boggling,'' said Michael Flanagan, an
independent securities industry analyst based in the Philadelphia
area. ``Valuations are skyrocketing, reflecting the dearth of
investment banks`` with good technology franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders will still control more than 80 percent of Weisel
Partners' equity after the deal and the firm intends to stay
independent, a person close to the firm said. A spokeswoman for the
firm declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Weisel Partners is one of the last remaining independent
investment banks in San Francisco. During a selling frenzy over the
past three years, almost all the city's home-grown firms were taken
over, including Montgomery, Robertson Stephens and Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Another independent San Francisco firm, Volpe Brown Whelan, is
reportedly near an agreement to sell out to Prudential Securities
for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion valuation of Weisel Partners is just under seven
times the firm's projected 1999 revenue. By contrast, Chase
Manhattan Corp. is paying $1.35 billion to buy Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,
about eight times revenue. But that price includes a premium for
taking control of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months ended in September, Weisel Partners completed
51 public or private stock offerings and advised on six merger
deals, worth a total of $13.5 billion. It ranked 21st among
investment banks nationwide in public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The firm started in January with $30 million in capital
contributed by partners and $35 million from outside investors. The
outside investors got a 7 percent stake, giving the firm an initial
value of $500 million.

NEWLY AGGRESSIVE GORE FOLLOWS CLINTON MODEL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas, Fla., N.Y., N.H.)   (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore tells audiences these days,
``I want to fight for you,'' and boy, does he mean it.
</P>
<P>
   He is fighting every day, around the clock and through the news
cycles, with his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley. Gore
rips him in speeches, flames him on the Internet, denounces him in
editorial interviews, attacks him even in a little hand-drawn
chart, calling his health-care plan a budget-buster, warning that
he wants to scrap Medicaid and shouting that on top of it all,
Bradley will have to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly the new Alpha Gore at work, sculpted by seasoned
campaign warriors like Bob Shrum and Carter Eskew. But it is also
the old Bill Clinton. It seems like centuries ago, but it was just
seven years back when the somewhat apolitical, seemingly morally
superior Paul Tsongas _ a figure not unlike Bradley _ was winning
plaudits as the low-key, authentic candidate, the one who was above
the fray, who appealed to independents and seemed like a refreshing
alternative to politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Until Clinton bared his claws.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign did to Tsongas what Democrats usually do to
Republicans _ assert that he would undermine Medicare and cut
Social Security. That did it, especially with old people in
Florida, where the Clinton campaign unleashed its most blistering
criticisms. Tsongas hardly knew what hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems to have the Clinton playbook on his bedside table.
And like Tsongas, Bradley seems a little dazed by the relentless
assaults. The most he has been able to muster is that Gore is being
dishonest and is distorting his record. He is fighting back in his
own low-key way, but to some this is little more than a cry in the
woods reminiscent of that of another wounded candidate, Bob Dole,
who snapped in 1988 when the anchorman Tom Brokaw asked him if he
had anything to say to his rival, Vice President George Bush.
``Yeah,'' Dole growled into the camera. ``Stop lying about my
record!''
</P>
<P>
   What Tsongas and Dole have in common, of course, is that they
both lost. The Gore campaign is obviously hoping to consign Bradley
to the same fate. The question is whether Gore can villify Bradley
without alienating voters and coming across as a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is getting awfully, awfully close to the
edge of demagoguery,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at
the Brookings Institution. ``As long as he's allowed to get away
with it, he'll be fine. But it's time for this to stop working.
Mean is out.'' This is evident on the Republican side, where the
front-runners, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., are all smiles to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hess acknowledges the exigencies of politics and the long
list of unsuccessful candidates who have failed to fight back. And
he said that Bradley might be taking an even greater risk by not
defending himself _ even if doing so undercuts his image as a
nonpolitician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is sort of moseying around, and that's been
attractive, but now he's got to fight back,'' Hess said. He said
Bradley's so-far muted response suggested a campaign that was not
ready for prime time. ``There is still something a little
amateurish about the Bradley campaign, which has its charms, but
they better get some professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters are appalled by the turn of events. Clark
Rasmussen, who was the Clinton-Gore campaign director in Iowa in
1996 but now supports Bradley, summed up the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Gore is doing on the health care, the Medicare-Medicaid
issue, is just abominable,'' Rasmussen said. ``And people see
through that. That's a core value for Democrats. To think that our
vice president would be attacking Bradley for coming out with such
a forward-looking health-care plan on such a core value is
incomprehensible to Iowans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those supporters see another risk in the Gore assault. If Gore
wins the nomination, the pounding could hurt his ability to attract
Bradley supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But to Gore advisers, the risks seem minimal and the benefits
tangible. Gore has halted his slide in the polls and is pulling
back even with Bradley in states like New Hampshire and New York,
where he was trailing. Pounding Bradley on his proposals, Gore
advisers say, is a way for Gore to distinguish himself from a
fellow Democrat with whom he is ideologically in sync and allows
him to assert himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers were worried that Gore began his assault on
Bradley with an overly negative tone. In September, the vice
president started taking him on directly and accusing him of being
a bad Democrat for voting for the Reagan budget cuts and
``quitting'' the Senate with his retirement in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That revved up Gore supporters but was viewed internally in the
Gore camp as too divisive. Now Gore has dropped that personal
reference. ``Everyone's very happy with this, as long as we stay on
the issues,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, justified Gore's approach
this way: ``These are serious issues, this is a presidential
campaign, and people want to know that you're going to fight for
them on issues they care about.'' Lehane added that Bradley's
laid-back approach raised a serious question about him. ``If you
are not willing to fight for your ideas in a campaign,'' he asked,
``when will you?''
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the architect of Clinton's successful 1992
strategy, sneers at those who question Gore's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be on a different planet than everyone else,'' Carville
said, ``but why would you put out a comprehensive plan and not
expect it to be the topic of discussion or attack? That's politics.
That's discourse. The real risk in a democracy is to let people do
something and then just accept it on its face.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville dismissed any notion that Gore might be coming across
as too negative. ``This is all wimpy, press, editorial goof-ball
mush,'' he said. ``I'm nauseated with the sort of goo-goo pristine
idea that you can't question someone's proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's combativeness has been evident in the past, as in his
debates with Dan Quayle, Ross Perot and Jack Kemp, and he is not
uncomfortable in this mode. After all, he was the candidate who in
1988 first raised the issue of prison furloughs in Massachusetts,
laying the groundwork for Vice President Bush to seize on the image
of Willie Horton.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ian Robinson, the chief executive of Scottish Power
PLC, likes to tell how a young man from a modest background _
himself _ discovered the world's widest horizons.
</P>
<P>
   As an engineering graduate in his early 20s, he was offered a
job in the copper mines of Zambia, then the British colony of
Northern Rhodesia. The son of a railroad worker from northeastern
England, he had never flown before.
</P>
<P>
   When his airplane developed engine trouble over Uganda, he was
grounded for three days until a replacement engine arrived from
London. He spent those days in a swank hotel on Lake Victoria,
partying with the flight crew until the plane was repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The tyro engineer and the reveler, may be difficult to discern
in the solid, silver-haired executive who is now 57 . But the
appetite for new horizons seems undiminished. He has built his
company into Britain's biggest power and water utility and is
leading a charge into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, Scottish Power completed the $6.5 billion
acquisition of PacifiCorp, based in Portland, Ore., the first
British acquisition of an American utility.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at Scottish Power in 1995 as chief executive, he
has built its customer base from 1.8 million to 7.5 million _
including the 2 million American customers of PacifiCorp. In
Britain, he has added gas, water and telecommunications companies
to the corporate portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But after mining the deregulation of British utilities for
growth, he sees the United States _ with its fragmented utility
business also going through deregulation _ as ripe for similar
alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he sees the world's utilities market as headed for
consolidation into just a handful of global players. ``Scottish
Power has to be one of them,'' he said at the company's new London
offices.
</P>
<P>
   So why focus on the United States when Europe's new single
market is on his doorstep?
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is way behind in the process of deregulating power and
other utilities,'' he said. ``So we think that the U.S. has a lot
of potential for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When he talks about the United States, he speaks from
experience. He lived there for four years among the 22 he spent
working for American engineering companies. In 1986, he became a
managing director of John Brown Ltd., a British engineering
company. He rose to become chairman in 1992 of the engineering
division of its parent company, Trafalgar House PLC, controlling
projects in more than 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Glasgow, where the company is based, with his wife,
Kay; they raised two childeren there. He travels extensively.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say Robinson has been able to court political
leaders and pursue expansion because he has granted substantial
day-to-day authority to talented aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of utilities in Britain are characterized by having a
very strong individual at the top,'' said Simon Flowers, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch in Edinburgh. ``What Ian Robinson has created is a
really strong team.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson expects to travel more than ever to rally his forces.
``I regard myself as the leader of the team and part of my job is
to ensure that we get the best out of the team when we work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a penchant for cultivating his political connections
face to face. The night in late November when he received word of
approval of the PacifiCorp deal by Utah regulatory authorities, he
had dinner with Scottish members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson may cast himself as an exemplar of the market-driven
1990s, but Scottish Power is itself protected from predators by a
so-called golden share _ in effect, the power to veto a takeover _
held by the Scottish authorities. He has cemented his ties to the
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair by running its high-profile
welfare-to-work program for young people.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of restructuring _ and the downsizing that comes with
it _ political connections provide useful protection against
criticism of job losses. Robinson freely acknowledges that, as it
has expanded with acquisitions, Scottish Power has shed some 5,000
jobs. But he sees that as a price of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The company says 3,000 other jobs have been created, largely by
a telecommunications subsidiary called Thus PLC, which had its own
initial public offering last month. With the PacifiCorp merger, the
company now employs 24,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, clearly proud of Scottish Power's success, recently
provided a diary of a typical week to a British newspaper. He
listed a 60- or 70-hour routine. And he often works weekends,
leaving not enough time for golf. (His handicap is 15.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the job, and have a passion for the job,'' he said.
It's a passion that Americans will be seeing a lot more closely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A profile last Sunday about Paul Sagan, president of Akamai
Technologies, misstated the year that a former colleague, Peter
Landis, began working with him at New York 1, the cable news
station. It was 1995, not 1991; Landis did not take part in
starting the station.

rush back to their typewriters and tap out reviews for tomorrow's

 &HT;    Changes deflate Florida county's Bible course
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ As a high school elective here, the Bible
just can't compete with home economics or shop.
</P>
<P>
   Brought forward by Christian activists, a controversial Bible
class similar to the one that will be debated today by the Georgia
Board of Education was offered in January 1998. More than 150
students enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   But the day before the class started, a federal court blocked
Lee County's original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   What's left in this Gulf Coast community is a course based on a
college textbook written by a Stetson University professor.
</P>
<P>
   The case remains the legal watermark for districts that want to
incorporate Bible courses into their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But just 23 months after all eight of Lee County's public high
schools offered the class, no one is teaching it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Not enough students signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Some seniors don't want to risk their grade-point averages by
taking a college-level course, which the Bible class is, said
Douglas Whittaker, executive director of curriculum for the Lee
County school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is, `I'm going to take ceramics,'''
Whittaker said. ``This wasn't a Sunday school class. This was a
rigorous academic class.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more critical in the enrollment drop-off has been the
court-mandated recording of the courses. Watchdog groups monitor
the video and audio tapes, making sure instructors don't stray into
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students were just very uncomfortable taking a class that was
under glass like that,'' said Mike McNerney, principal at Mariner
High School, the last school in the county that taught Introduction
to the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the course really ever had a chance because it
was political in nature,'' McNerney said, ``and that spelled defeat
from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Board of Education member Bruce Jackson has said
state School Superintendent Linda Schrenko and others gain
political capital from the Bible proposal, ``whether we approve it
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lehigh Senior High, across the county in this southwest
Florida community, Principal Pete Folaros said the history
instructor who volunteered to teach the class felt apprehensive
because of community scrutiny. Reached Wednesday, the teacher
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he might face personal damages,'' Folaros said.
``Even though the district would go to bat for him'' there was no
guarantee a teacher might not become the subject of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The issue first surfaced in 1996 when a citizens group asked for
a high school Bible course. The five-member school board approved
the idea 3-2, creating a committee to design a legally acceptable
Bible class.
</P>
<P>
   The committee met for 1 1/2 years but fractured into two groups:
a minority that favored a secular presentation of biblical events
and a majority that advocated material from the North
Carolina-based National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public
Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Local Christian activists supported the North Carolina material.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevic barred the
group's New Testament course because it might violate
constitutional bans against teaching religion in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kovachevic, in her ruling, expressed constitutional reservations
over the presentation of Christ's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judge, ``the only reasonable interpretation of
the Resurrection is a religious interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   School districts debating Bible courses should tread cautiously
in light of what's happened in Fort Myers, advised Whittaker, the
Lee County curriculum chief.
</P>
<P>
   Kovachevic ``is very conservative and tends to align herself
with the political right _ and she found that curriculum
untenable,'' Whittaker said. ``You're probably going to end up in
court if you choose to use it. It's a prescription for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, two years after the debate started, Bible class
opponents spent $14,000 on election advertising and voted out two
school board members who supported the North Carolina curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves just one school board member who favors the more
evangelical course.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described Christian conservative Lanny Moore, a member of
the committee that recommended the original class material, was
elected to the Lee County school board after it approved the idea
of a Bible course.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said most of the committee's time was spent arguing over
whether a class should be taught at all. He's distressed the North
Carolina curriculum was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any vestiges of the Christian influence basically has been
expunged from the social studies and history classes in our
district,'' Moore said. ``If you can't teach history as it happened
in an academic setting, where can you teach it? You can't teach
Christianity, and you can't allude to it. Where's your academic
freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wayne Robinson, whose Unitarian Universalist Church of
Fort Myers was a primary opponent of the course, argued that the
material originally proposed was little more than an extended
Sunday school class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate in the media made it seem like an issue of faith,''
Robinson said. ``I really think it was misunderstanding of our
Constitution. ... We respect all religions and minorities. But
we're not to establish a religion.''

AS U.N. NEARS ACTION ON IRAQ, INSPECTIONS REMAIN UNSETTLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two Security Council resolutions that pave the
way toward a new relationship between the United Nations and Iraq
are headed for a decision this week, diplomats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative, said, ``We
are now on the run to a final vote.''
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to extend the oil-for-food program is expected to
pass on Friday without much debate. Under that program, the Iraqis
are allowed to sell $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months to
pay for urgent civilian needs. That vote is expected to lead the
Iraqis to resume oil exports, which they suspended three weeks ago
to protest stopgap extensions.
</P>
<P>
   More difficult will be the adoption of a plan creating a new
arms inspection system for Iraq, which could lead to a suspension
of the crippling embargo on Saddam Hussein's government next year.
The embargo was imposed after Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
This vote is tentatively planned for Saturday, but governments are
still discussing key provisions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, the sanctions were
linked to Iraqi promises to destroy all prohibited weapons. The
sanctions have remained in place because inspectors could not
certify that Iraq was free of biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons and certain missile systems, or was not trying to re-create
them from hidden material or illegal imports.
</P>
<P>
   At issue now between the United States and Russia is how and
when to determine that Iraq is in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The current draft of the resolution gives the new U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission and its
executive chairman, to be appointed by the secretary-general, the
responsibility for setting the tasks Iraq must accomplish and for
judging progress.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and a majority of other council
members interpret that as demanding a high level of compliance with
both the new commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which will be responsible for watching Iraq's nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   Russia prefers a demonstration of cooperation with inspectors as
a new system is installed in Iraq but not a requirement to meet all
disarmament tasks before sanctions could be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also wants a suspension of sanctions _ to be reviewed
every 120 days under the newest draft _ to take place by the end of
next year, a fixed date. The U.S. says sanctions should be
suspended only after Iraq has met the tasks assigned by the new
inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the U.S. undersecretary of state, was in New
York again Thursday for talks with the Russian envoy, Sergey
Lavrov, but diplomats would not say what they discussed.

U.S. TOLD TO SPEND MORE TO NEUTRALIZE SOVIET GERM SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has made ``impressive strides'' in
preventing former Soviet scientists from working for rogue states
and terrorists seeking unconventional weapons, but it should spend
much more to achieve that aim, a Washington research group said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the consequences of the chemical and biological brain
drain,'' says a report issued by the Henry L. Stimson Center in
Washington, ``sound argument can be made for at least doubling the
amount of money going annually into collaborative research grants
for biological weaponeers, and at a minimum tripling the grant
funds for chemical weapons scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon alone has allocated $3.172 billion since 1992 to
help the former Soviet states secure and dismantle their weapons of
mass destruction and keep their scientists peacefully employed. But
Amy E. Smithson, a chemical and germ warfare expert who wrote the
report, argues that much of this money has been skewed toward the
nuclear sector and too little of it toward keeping germ and
chemical scientists gainfully employed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the administration has invested about $250 million
in the four programs aimed at engaging former Soviet weapons
scientists in collaborative research. Of that amount, Dr. Smithson
says, only $7.5 million has gone toward supporting chemists, and
only $19.5 million for support of former biological weapons
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she writes, the major American grant program got
money in 1998 to only 1,000 of the 7,000 biological scientists with
expertise in deadly germs. And of those who received grants and
stipends, the average support was ``inadequate to keep 10,500 key
chemical and biological weapons experts above the poverty line.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the cost of a six-year effort to vaccinate American
forces against anthrax, a Soviet germ weapon, is $130 million, the
report says ``it is more cost-effective to stop proliferation at
the source.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Smithson says the exhaustive review process of prospective
grants results in substantial delays in getting money to scientists
in desperate need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists who need to feed their families will find it
difficult to withstand the prosperity that proliferators offer if
the proposal approval process drags on for more than two years,''
notes the report, which is scheduled to be published Friday.
Moreover, the four different pots of money to contain the problem
``invite complication'' and competition among the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticizes the Russian government for keeping
``hold-over apparatchiks'' intent on blocking scientific
cooperation in positions of power.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from such hard-line elements has kept four key
biological labs run by the military and a network of anti-plague
institutes closed to outside scrutiny, the report says. In turn,
that fosters suspicion about whether Russia is still conducting
illegal germ and chemical weapons research and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike these Cold Warriors, the overwhelming majority of the
scientists want out of the weapons business,'' she concludes, based
on visits to former Soviet unconventional weapons institutes and
interviews with administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Smithson, whose views on chemical weapons are well respected
by conservative and liberal defense analysts in Washington,
disagrees with those who argue that cutting money for Russian
science will force Moscow to open its military institutes and
become more open about its past weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Offering incentives, she says, is more likely to entice military
scientists who are trying to find their way in Russia's turbulent
economy and half-hearted political reform.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, she gives high marks to the concept of stopping the
spread of dangerous nuclear, chemical and biological expertise by
engaging the very scientists who built the unconventional weapons
that were once aimed at America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to milk a rattlesnake,'' she writes, quoting an
American official involved in the programs, ``one has to grab it by
the head.''

TRANSPORTATION BOARD HURT BY `SERIOUS OVERLOAD,' STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Transportation Safety Board is facing
increasing doubt, from inside its ranks and from outside aviation
experts, about its ability to investigate complex aviation
accidents as it attempts to re-structure itself and cope with a
variety of high-stakes investigations.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report released Thursday by Rand Corp., requested
by the safety board officials last year, the board is ``coping with
serious overload.'' Rand researchers reported having ``encountered
a consistent uneasiness regarding the ability of the NTSB to
generate timely, accurate results.'' And among the staff and board
members, aviation veterans are raising questions about the quality
of the board's work.
</P>
<P>
   Two principal authors of the $400,000 study declined to identify
specific cases. But within the five-member board and among its
staff, there is dissatisfaction with, for example, the
investigation into a fire on board a Federal Express DC-10 flying
from Boston to Memphis in September 1996. The plane made an
emergency landing in Newburgh, N.Y., and the five crew members
barely escaped with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board found evidence that a bio-medical device on
board had been improperly carrying a flammable fluid, and some of
the investigators thought that was the cause of the fire. But the
board decided there was insufficient evidence to isolate that
device as the probable cause of the accident, which destroyed a
$30-million aircraft, partly because the staff could not say how
much of the liquid was present before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't nail the facts down,'' said one board member, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the time needed to complete major
investigations was ``climbing alarmingly.'' The September 1994
crash near Pittsburgh of a Boeing 737 operated by USAir, which
killed all 132 people on board, took more than four years to study.
The explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in July 1996 is
still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as the board restructures itself, struggling
over who should release information on accidents _ and when _ and
over its public image.
</P>
<P>
   In October, without meeting, the board quietly approved a new
order on media relations that bars a board member from staying at
the scene of a crash for more than five days without the permission
of the board chairman. Board members say the vote was a reaction to
the TWA 800 crash, in which Robert T. Francis, the vice chairman,
stayed on Long Island for weeks, appearing at joint briefings with
the FBI and the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, James E. Hall, has also broken the regular pattern
of sending board members to accidents according to a rotation
system; for the crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane and the
Egyptair 990 crash, he went himself, although it was not his turn
to go.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hall has instituted stricter controls on travel,
following inquiries about travel expenses by members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The various changes have produced some resentment within the
board.
</P>
<P>
   The board is also struggling with the flow of information.
Long-time board officials say they are stunned at the growing
intensity of media interest after high-profile crashes, from that
of TWA 800 to those of Kennedy's single-engine plane in July and
Egyptair in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand study released Thursday also called for changes in the
``party'' system, in which the board works with groups like the
airline, the airplane and engine manufacturers and the pilots'
union during investigations. The study said that the system was
prone to the appearance of conflict of interest problems.  &QL;

EWING READY TO START, BUT HE'S NOT EXACTLY SMILING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ A glowering Patrick Ewing stepped out of a side
door to the gym Thursday and made a direct line to a driver waiting
for him in a Lincoln Navigator, never breaking his loping gait to
confirm an end to the drama. Moments earlier, Coach Jeff Van Gundy
had announced that Ewing would start Friday night against
Philadelphia at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the first playing time for Ewing since he partially
tore his Achilles' tendon on June 1, during Game 2 of the Eastern
Conference finals. Instead of expressing relief that his long wait
was over, Ewing profanely declined to comment on his return as he
left the team's practice facility at SUNY-Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ewing was fined $10,000 by the National Basketball
Association for refusing to grant the news media accessibility this
week. This afternoon, the team fined him (the amount was believed
to be $10,000) for failing to make himself available after practice
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties probably serve only to further irritate Ewing.
This season, he has been reclusive in a locker room full of
teammates who do not treat him with reverence, angry at an
organization that has provided him with a $68 million deal while
trading or cutting his friends, and upset at how his Achilles'
tendon partially tore when team physicians assured him it would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the ways Ewing's edginess has manifested itself, members
of the organization and teammates believe he has been wrestling
with the reality of being on the decline as a superstar. In
October, Ewing began training camp by saying that he would not
return ``until I feel that the pain is gone, and I can play the way
I'm accustomed to playing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be me if I'm playing hurt,'' he said. ``When I can't
be me, I'm going to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Ewing expects instant results. His coach and teammates
understand that he has missed 88 regular-season games over the last
three seasons and do not expect a miracle performance from him
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect him to get better over time,'' Van Gundy said
Thursday. ``I expect him to probably struggle for a couple of
weeks. The big thing is, I want him to enjoy these last X-amount of
years he has to play. I'm concerned with that. He has had a great,
great career. He's won a lot of games and helped two teams get to
the finals. He's a top-50 player and Hall of Famer. I just want him
to enjoy the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Larry Johnson could be Ewing's example. As Johnson has
experienced, there comes a time when helping the team win is just
as enjoyable as being able to carry it. Not to the extent of Ewing,
but Johnson was once an All-Star go-to man before injuries limited
his impact in the box score.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I just put all that stuff out of my mind and said
`Win,''' Johnson said. ``It was so sweet last year. Everyone has a
role, and what you do is understand your role, accept your role and
enjoy playing your role. There's a difference in accepting your
role and playing your role. When you enjoy it, and you win ... How
can you not have fun winning?''
</P>
<P>
   A lot depends on how Ewing adjusts to Latrell Sprewell and Allan
Houston, how they adjust to him and how other players respond to
having their minutes decreased. Instead of answering questions
surrounding the date of Ewing's return, others will pop up in their
place for Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Knicks knew about Ewing's decision to return. He
told only Van Gundy after practice and never said a word to his
teammates. For more than two weeks, Ewing has practiced without
pain but had given no indication when he would be ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the TNT commentator John Thompson, Ewing's former
coach at Georgetown, announce before a television audience
Wednesday night that a ``little bird'' told him the Knicks' center
would be back on Friday, Van Gundy approached Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Patrick about that before practice,'' Van Gundy said
Thursday, referring to Thompson's comments. ``He said he hadn't
made up his mind. But after practice, I talked to him and he said
he is going to play tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncomfortable position for Van Gundy, knowing that
Ewing had apparently let Thompson in on his plans first. ``I'm more
happy that he's back than disappointed in the other,'' Van Gundy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy embraces the chance to have Ewing on the floor again,
in whatever capacity. The team is woeful in rebounding, ranked 25th
in the league. And they have not had a consistent low-post threat
all season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team is finally healthy and intact, Van Gundy is
not expecting Ewing's impact to be the cure-all for a team with a
so-so record of 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick may not be able to add anything tomorrow,'' Van Gundy
said. ``I don't know. You put your best players out there when
they're coming back, you let them play, you see what they can do
and go from there.''

ATP OVERHAULS TOP EVENTS AND RANKING SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATP Tour officials announced a marketing makeover Thursday that
they believe will offer a bolder and more structured look to men's
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted fans to know more than just four times a year that
something important in tennis is happening,'' said Mark Miles, the
ATP Tour's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP has repackaged the Super 9, its nine premier
tournaments, into the Tennis Masters Series, which features four
tournaments in North America, five in Europe and concludes with the
season-ending Tennis Masters Cup, formerly the Grand Slam Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The tour has created a new ranking system for 18 tournaments _
the ATP Champions Race 2000 _ which starts with each player having
zero points at the start of each year. The ranking replaces a
hard-to-follow system in which points were constantly rolled over
on a 52-week cycle. Miles said the system is designed to encourage
the best players to enter more tournaments and to build up
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is totally baffled by our current ranking system,''
Miles said. ``Pete Sampras can beat Andre Agassi in the final of
Wimbledon, and at the conclusion of the match have Andre Agassi
pass him to be the No. 1 player on the board. That won't happen
with the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATP has sold the television, sponsorship and licensing
rights to the nine Tennis Masters tournaments and the Tennis
Masters Cup to ISL Worldwide, a global marketing firm, for $1.2
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis has always suffered from fragmentation in the
marketplace,'' Miles said. ``Each tournament sold its own
television, sponsorships and licensing. Now we'll control
production and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, Miles said, ISL Television will spend
three times as much as the networks have spent on producing the
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP is also paring from 212 to 15 the number of sponsors of
the Masters Series and Masters Cup. Now, Miles said, the smaller,
centralized group of sponsors ``will have an interest in promoting

MANDELA AND GATES TALK PHILANTHROPY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa,
had breakfast Thursday morning at the Lake Washington estate of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Bill and Melinda that I haven't got a word in English
to describe my impression of the house,'' Mandela recounted
afterward. ``I don't think beautiful, or exquisite, is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere during the three-day visit here that began on
Wednesday, Mandela took the baton and led the Seattle Symphony and
a high-school choir in a rendition of the South African national
anthem. He smiled graciously at a public school when questions from
students were read aloud, and one wanted to know what he had done
with his ``spare time'' during 27 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most forcefully, though, as the Nobel Peace laureate
sought support for a newly formed foundation intended to promote
health care and education across the African continent, Mandela
implored business leaders here and across the country to get
involved in a crusade to develop vaccines, including one against
the AIDS virus, and distribute them to rich and poor alike around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children across Africa die every day because they don't have
access to vaccines that children in communities like Seattle take
for granted,'' Mandela, the 81-year-old former president and
anti-apartheid leader, said Thursday at a global health forum at
the University of Washington here.
</P>
<P>
   That Mandela and his wife, Graca Machel, would choose to make a
relatively extended trip to Seattle is a powerful demonstration of
the growing role of philanthropies based here in the Pacific
Northwest. Seattle is home to three of the world's richest men (
Gates, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Microsoft's President
Steve Ballmer), and the foundation established by Gates and his
wife recently became the biggest philanthropic organization in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Craig and Susan McCaw Foundation, also based here, helped to
sponsor the trip. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, is
chairman of Teledesic LLC and is hoping to develop an ``Internet in
the Sky'' satellite system, in part with backing from Gates'
company.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was to be the only stop on his trip to this country, but
the White House said Thursday that Mandela was likely to stop off
briefly in Florida on Saturday, on his way home, to meet with
President Clinton, who will be speaking to the state Democratic
convention there. The two plan to discuss Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons for coming to Seattle, the Mandelas showed
impeccably good timing, as they clearly wound up giving a needed
lift to a city reeling from the aftermath of the protests that
engulfed the streets during last week's meeting of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Mandelas reserved their highest praise for Gates. During a
brief interview Thursday morning, the two men were all smiles with
each other, and at one point Mandela placed his hand on Gates' knee
while recalling their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, anybody who is aware of what is going on in the world
knew of Bill even before you met him,'' Mandela said, ``and I had
the honor of meeting him in my official residence in 1997. And, as
usual, he was very generous.'' Ms. Machel, speaking of Gates before
the audience at the University of Washington, said, ``You are
gifted and you decided to use your gift to share with millions of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela spoke repeatedly of the need to develop a vaccine
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   After Gates spoke with some passion about his desire to develop
vaccines for a whole host of diseases, Mandela rose and mockingly
chided him for ``a very important omission'' in his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a vaccine against old age,'' the elder
statesman deadpanned, as his audience broke into laughter and
cheers. ``I hope that Bill will go to work to develop that
vaccine.''

TYCO STOCK FALLS 23 PERCENT AFTER COMPANY DISCLOSES SEC INQUIRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyco International's stock price fell 23 percent Thursday,
trading at its lowest price in more than a year after the company
disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking
into Tyco's merger accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco said that the SEC staff had begun a ``non-public informal
inquiry'' related to charges and reserves taken in connection with
acquisitions made by Tyco, a conglomerate that has grown rapidly
through mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent market activity in our stock, which is
not justified by any development at the company, we welcome the
opportunity to respond to this request,'' said L. Dennis Kozlowski,
the chairman and chief executive of Tyco. ``We remain confident of
our accounting methodology, our public disclosures and the
continuing strength of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tyco spokesman, J. Brad McGee, said that the SEC had sought
all supporting documents relating to charges and reserves taken by
Tyco during the last six years. During that time, it made more than
120 acquisitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco shares fell $8.25, to $28 in New York Stock Exchange
trading, on volume of 114 million shares, the largest daily volume
in the company's history. Thursday's low of $22.50 was the lowest
price for the stock since October 1998 and was less than half the
prices realized in July when Kozlowski raised $170 million by
selling shares and Mark Swartz, the company's chief financial
officer, sold $108 million of his shares.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco's stock price peaked Oct. 8 at $53.875, adjusted for a
subsequent split, but fell after the company's accounting was
criticized by David W. Tice, an analyst and money manager whose
newsletter, ``Behind The Numbers,'' is followed by many
institutional investors. Tice said that the large charges Tyco had
taken after it made takeovers had inflated later reported profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, a column in The New York Times reported that two
companies acquired by Tyco had taken big writeoffs just before
being acquired, making later comparisons look better than they
would have otherwise been. The column said that Tyco had not fully
disclosed those writeoffs in filings with the SEC, though Swartz
said that the information had been provided to analysts who
requested it.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that all the criticisms were unfounded, and
emphasized that the SEC had not challenged its accounting when it
reviewed filings made in connection with numerous deals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Tyco announcement indicated that while the SEC was
seeking a vast amount of information, it had not begun a formal
investigation. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Tyco employees Thursday, which the company
released, Kozlowski said that ``Tyco will emerge from this episode
even stronger than before,'' he wrote. ``All things considered,
this is very exciting time for Tyco and I am confident in our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the October criticisms of the company's
accounting, the share price fell to as low as $35. It then rallied,
as many Wall Street analysts said the company's accounting was
proper and recommended the stock. It climbed back to more than $45
before beginning to slip during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, with the share price again around $35, Kozlowski
issued a statement saying that Tyco ``remained on target to meet
expectations for the quarter and year for sales, earnings and cash
flow.'' McGee said that the company received the SEC's request for
information on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco retains considerable support on Wall Street. Phua Young, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., issued a report Thursday
reaffirming his buy rating on Tyco. ``While this investigation puts
a further cloud on the stock,'' Young wrote, ``we believe that the
company will receive a clean bill of health from the SEC regarding
its accounting policies, which could put an end to all the rumors
and accusations.''

PANEL URGES REMOVING NUCLEAR ARMS FROM ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arms-control experts and members of Congress urged
President Clinton and the Pentagon on Thursday to take the American
nuclear arsenal off alert, a move that would allow additional time
for government leaders to gauge possible nuclear strikes and
determine responses.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the National Press Club, Dr. Bruce
Blair, a former Air Force missile-control officer who is a military
analyst at the Brookings Institute, said the time that leaders had
to launch retaliatory missiles should be extended, from minutes to
days, or even longer. Calling the issue neglected, Blair said
national security was ``in considerable jeopardy in continuing to
operate nuclear weapons as though the Cold War didn't end.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there was a widespread misconception that nuclear
weapons in the United States had been taken off alert.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a pact in 1994 by President Clinton and President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia to stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other,
nuclear warheads remain attached to missiles, and targets can be
activated in seconds. National security advisers have 2 to 30
minutes to respond to a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Blair said, ``Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have
only a few minutes, at best, in which to evaluate reports of an
apparent incoming missile strike and decide the fate of the world.
This is an intolerably short time.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlined proposed steps for lowering the alert status. First,
all submarines should be placed on a ``relaxed state of alert,'' he
said. Clinton and Yeltsin should eliminate and renounce the
launching of missiles in case of an incoming attack, Blair said,
and all but 500 missiles should be taken off alert. The United
States should also encourage other nuclear powers, including
Britain, China and France, to remove their nuclear weapons from
active status.
</P>
<P>
   The American strategic war plan includes 3,000 targets in
Russia, a 20 percent increase since 1995, Blair said. ``The United
States needs to take a leadership role on this issue,'' former Sen.
Dale Bumpers, director of the Center for Defense Information in
Washington, said at the news conference. ``On that basis, we will
have the moral and political basis on which to ask Russia to
reciprocate.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a coup attempt in Moscow led President George Bush to
take the warheads off strategic bombers and thousands of nuclear
missiles. President Mikhail Gorbachev of Russia took similar
measures about a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., introduced a resolution in Congress
in August that calls on the United States and Russia, as well as
other countries with nuclear arsenals, to negotiate verifiable
methods for ensuring that all nuclear warheads have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has 84 co-sponsors in the House, urges the
Defense and State Departments to increase the time needed to launch
nuclear missiles and to study the effects that might have on
nuclear deterrence and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weapons should not sit like cars at a drag race with
revved engines waiting for the start light to turn green,'' Markey
said. ``We need to slow down the decision-making engine to ensure
that decision makers have time to be 100 percent certain.''

BELLSOUTH JOINS WITH DUTCH IN $20 BILLION GERMAN WIRELESS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ BellSouth Corp. upset the chessboard of
European mobile communications Thursday, teaming up with the Dutch
phone company KPN to take control of E-Plus Mobilfunk, Germany's
third-largest wireless telephone network, in a transaction worth
nearly $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the unusual deal, BellSouth will not put up any of its own
cash. Instead, it will exercise options to buy full control of
E-Plus Mobilfunk but transfer the shares to KPN, which will put up
about $10 billion in financing.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, BellSouth will retain its 22 percent stake in
E-Plus but will get half the seats on its board and have veto
rights over significant decisions, including on any future mergers
or partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth will also have the option to convert its E-Plus stake
after 18 months into a 19-percent stake in KPN. At the Dutch
company's current market price, such a stake would be worth about
$6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, BellSouth said it would lend KPN $3 billion for
additional wireless investments in Europe in exchange for
additional warrants for KPN shares.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a financial coup for the Atlanta-based BellSouth,
because its stake in E-Plus is likely to be worth more as a result
of its expanded control. It is also a victory for KPN, giving it a
key position in Germany, the largest economy in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth's chairman and chief executive,
said, ``We think we've got a good partner, a nimble partner, and we
get to preserve options for ourselves about what we might want to
do in Europe in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was a significant setback for France Telecom, which
thought it had reached its own deal to pay $9 billion or so for
more than 60 percent of the stock in E-Plus being sold by Vodafone
AirTouch of Britain and two German utility giants, Veba and RWE.
France Telecom's shares have dropped more than 7 percent since
rumors of a BellSouth move appeared on Tuesday in The Financial
Times.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom had hoped to use E-Plus as a staging area for
competing against Deutsche Telekom AG, Germany's dominant phone
carrier. The French and German phone companies broke up a
longstanding partnership earlier this year, after Deutsche Telekom
infuriated the French by making a surprise bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   But although France Telecom reached agreements to buy out the
E-Plus stakes held by Vodafone, Veba and RWE, BellSouth retained
rights of first refusal on those same shares, which means it had
the right to purchase them before they could be offered for sale to
others. BellSouth was one of the founding partners in E-Plus in
1993, paying about $150 million for its 22 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The deal negotiated Thursday underlined the enormous gambles
taking place in Europe's booming mobile communications industry.
The biggest competitors are all scrambling to build pan-European
wireless networks, spending the equivalent of tens of billions of
dollars to acquire businesses in such large markets as Britain,
Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is in the midst of a hostile takeover attempt against
Mannesmann AG, which controls wireless networks in Germany, Italy
and now Britain. The value of that deal has steadily risen with the
ascent in Vodafone's shares and is now worth an estimated $147
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom recently spent $11 billion to buy Britain's
smallest mobile phone company, One 2 One, and it remains on the
prowl for other international acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam Thursday, speculation about a possible deal drove
shares of KPN up 8.9 percent to a record high of 68.15 euros, or
$69.62. KPN's American depository receipts, each representing one
common share, rose $4.50, or 7 percent, to $68.875. BellSouth
gained $1.21 in New York, closing at $47.25.
</P>
<P>
   KPN, once a government-owned monopoly, is now majority-owned by
shareholders and its stock is traded on the Amsterdam, New York,
London and Frankfurt exchanges. The Dutch government still owns 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   KPN has about 3.2 million subscribers in the Netherlands, or 54
percent of the market. E-Plus has about 3.1 million subscribers, or
16 percent of the much larger German market. E-Plus is the youngest
of the three German wireless telephone networks, and has grown
rapidly since it began offering service less than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, with a population of more than 80 million, is poised
for continued rapid growth in mobile phone services. Though the
share of adults with cellular phones has climbed to 25 percent from
17 percent in the last year, mobile cellular phones use is still
less pervasive than in several Nordic countries and in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the merger impulse in the mobile phone business has been
driven by an effort by the companies to spread their costs over a
broader base of customers. By establishing cross-border networks,
providers can lower or even eliminate the ``roaming'' charges they
impose on customers from other countries _ a potentially big
marketing advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The European companies are also spending heavily on advanced
wireless-data technologies, which make it possible to tap into the
Internet over mobile devices and transmit data faster than over
ordinary fixed telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone was forced to sell its stake in E-Plus after it
acquired AirTouch Communications of San Francisco in January.
AirTouch had a big minority stake in Mannesmann's D2 mobile
network, and Vodafone would be prohibited from owning stakes in two
rival networks. Veba and RWE are in the midst of big mergers with
other power companies, and eager to solidify their resources on
those markets.
</P>
<P>
   The KPN deal for E-Plus is likely to intensify this urge to
merge among European telecommunications companies, particularly in
mobile communications.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is now in the position of having to look again
for paths to expansion, though officials refused to comment
Thursday night on BellSouth's deal with KPN. When the French phone
company announced its plan to take control of E-Plus, executives
characterized the move as merely the first of many steps to roll
out a broad array of telecommunication services across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, those plans have now been delayed.

SALEMME PLEADS GUILTY TO RACKETEERING

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tired after five years of legal wrangling, reputed New
England Mafia boss ais ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme pleaded guilty
Thursday to a federal racketeering indictment after prosecutors
agreed to drop murder charges that could have sent him to prison
for life.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a charcoal, pin-striped suit, Salemme, 66, took the
witness stand and admitted under oath that he formed a pact with
South Boston crime boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger to extort ``rent''
from bookmakers, loansharks and drug dealers from 1979 through
1994.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by US District Judge Mark L. Wolf if he had ever been
known by any other name, Salemme quipped, ``Not by myself your
honor, but by the press I'm known as Cadillac Frank Salemme.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Wolf described 15 counts of racketeering, extortion,
bribery, and interstate travel in aid of racketeering, and asked
Salemme if he had committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' was the response each time.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and Salemme's attorneys filed a plea
agreement, recommending that Salemme serve a sentence ranging from
10 years and 10 months to 13 1/2 years. Salemme would be credited
with the time he has been jailed _ since August 1995 _ awaiting
trial, meaning he could be free in 6 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme has not agreed to cooperate in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf accepted Salemme's plea, but has yet to decide whether he
will accept the agreement. If he rejects it, then under the
agreement, Salemme may withdraw his plea and go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the agreement as ``a good result for the government,''
US Attorney Donald K. Stern noted that Wolf had indicated that he
might dismiss allegations that Salemme killed four men in 1967.he
judge had raised questions about whether the grand jury was misused
to add the murder charges to an existing indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The killings include three Boston brothers, Edward, Walter, and
William Bennett, and another man, Richard Grasso.
</P>
<P>
   Without the murder charges, Stern said Salemme would probably
have faced eight to 10 years in prison, if convicted at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks it's easy to go back 37 years and prove
murders hasn't tried any of these cases,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Anthony Cardinale, who represents Salemme, said he was
confident that Salemme could have beaten the case, but there were
``no guarantees,'' and if the murder charges weren't dropped,
Salemme could have faced a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tired of fighting,'' said Cardinale, adding that Salemme
was anxious to distance himself from his codefendant, longtime
Bulger sidekick Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi. Both Bulger and
Flemmi have been exposed during the case as longtime FBI
informants.
</P>
<P>
   While Bulger has remained a fugitive since the 1995 indictment,
lawyers for Flemmi, Salemme, and reputed mobster Robert DeLuca have
tried to get the case dismissed because Bulger and Flemmi were
working as FBI informants at the same time the government says they
were members of the racketeering enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   During lengthy pretrial hearings, former FBI agents revealed a
cozy relationship between some FBI agents and Bulger and Flemmi.
One former FBI supervisor admitted pocketing $7,000 in bribes from
the pair and tipping them to cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a 661-page ruling in September, Wolf refused to dismiss the
case afr rejecting Flemmi's argument that the FBI promised him and
Bulger protection from prosecution. But Wolf is planning more
hearings and has barred prosecutors from using some evidence
against Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank doesn't want to be next to Flemmi for another second,
never mind another two years,'' said Cardinale, referring to
evidence that Flemmi leaked information to the FBI about Salemme's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardinale credited Salemme with helping expose Bulger and
Flemmi's relationship with the FBI. ``I believe that the positive
thing that's going to come out of it is you're going to see the
whole system of how the FBI deals with informants radically
changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chase, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's
Boston office, said the agency's informant guidelines are being
reviewed by the FBI and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did learn some lessons from this case and I think
we will benefit from them, and, yes, there will be some changes in
the rules,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme's departure from the case leaves just Flemmi and DeLuca.
``If we can resolve this case in a way that DeLuca doesn't have to
face a trial, that's an option we have to consider,'' said his
attorney, Randolph Gioia.
</P>
<P>
   As for Flemmi, his attorney, Kenneth Fishman, said, ``As far as
we're concerned, we're happy to have the courtroom to ourselves.''

CBS LETS MCDONOUGH GO

 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sean McDonough's 10-year career as one of the CBS's top
sports announcers will end later this month, apparently to help the
network open room for longtime NBC announcer Dick Enberg.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough, who also has been the television voice of the Red Sox
the last 12 years, showed great versatility at CBS. He worked two
World Series, the Olympics (bobsled and luge in Nagano), NCAA
basketball, a College World Series, and numerous golf events. He is
the son of Globe sports columnist Will McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   CBS would not confirm Enberg has signed with the network, but
sources said it was a done deal and that Enberg probably will
replace Verne Lundquist as the network's No. 2 NFL play-by-play
announcer next season.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough was told Tuesday by CBS Sports president Sean McManus
that his cntact would not be renewed. McDonough said he was
disappointed and would use his time off to ``sit on the sidelines
and wait for something good to come along.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said he hasn't been unemployed in 15 years. The
Syracuse graduate worked for ESPN before joining CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like playing musical chairs and when the music
stopped, I was the one without a chair,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   His last assignment with CBS will be the Sun Bowl Dec. 31
between Oregon and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said his first love is working Red Sox games, but his
status in that role is unclear as Fox 25 recently signed a deal as
the team's new television partner. ``That is the only team that I
actually care whether they win or lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The winds of change have been blowing at CBS for a while. When
the network acquired the rights to the AFC games two years ago,
McManus said he would be loyal to employees who didn't leave CBS
after it lost the rights to the NFC to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom had McDonough paired with Phil Simms as
the No. 1 NFL broadcasting team. Instead, McManus hired Greg
Gumbel, who had left CBS for NBC, to work with Simms.
</P>
<P>
   McManus's argument was that CBS needed to keep talented
announcers on its college football games to allay fears that NFL
games would drain CBS's best and brightest. McDonough took the hit
in stride and worked with Terry Donahue last year and Todd
Blackledge this season.

EDITORIAL: RHETORIC AND REALITY ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   More than eight years after American-led military forces
triumphed in the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein still rules Iraq
and continues to cheat on the surrender terms that require him to
eliminate all biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles
capable of delivering them. His galling defiance and America's
frustrations in dealing with him have again made Iraq an issue in a
U.S. presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas talks about contingencies in which
he would use American military power to ``take out'' Iraq's illegal
weapons. On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore argues,
with the benefit of hindsight, that Bush's father erred in 1991 by
not marching to Baghdad and toppling the Iraqi dictator in the
war's closing days.
</P>
<P>
   Such martial talk about a reviled foreign despot makes for
satisfying campaign oratory. But as Presidents Bush and Clinton
learned, containing Iraq's weapons and ambitions has never been
simply a military task. It has required long and often tortured
diplomacy involving a coalition of disparate countries that broadly
agree on the need to contain Saddam but not on every element of
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as early as Friday the U.N. Security Council will be
voting on a new compromise resolution that could bring
international arms inspectors back to Iraq after a costly yearlong
absence. Of the council's 15 members, 11 now support the main
elements of the resolution. Russia is the chief remaining holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would establish a new inspection commission with
powers to draw up a list of essential disarmament conditions Iraq
must fulfill to win limited relief from sanctions. If Baghdad meets
the conditions, including a resumption of unhampered inspections,
the council would consider a temporary suspension of sanctions.
Iraq's export revenues would pass through an internationally
supervised account, and its imports would be vetted to prevent the
purchase of weapons or weapons ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   France accepts all elements of this formula, but regrettably has
not committed itself to vote for the resolution. Russia, however,
seeks to dilute the list of disarmament conditions and require Iraq
only to admit the inspectors and leave them alone for a few months
instead of achieving specific disarmament benchmarks. That is
unacceptable. The Clinton administration, which made sensible and
significant adjustments in its Iraq policies to broaden U.N.
support, should not agree to dilute the resolution in the ways
Russia proposes. Intrusive arms inspections inside Iraq are the
most effective approach yet discovered for detecting and thwarting
illegal Iraqi weapons programs. Getting U.N. approval for a new
inspection program is less dramatic and stirring than the war cries
of the politicians. But it is far more useful.

NEW COCA-COLA CHIEF SAYS HE PLANS NO ABRUPT CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (With COCACOLA-NORRIS-COLUMN) 
(rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after his surprising selection as the next chairman
and chief executive of Coca-Cola, Douglas N. Daft got on the
telephone with reporters Thursday and talked about, among other
things, his feelings upon being asked to lead the soft-drink giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tended to range from shock to surprise to sorrow to
elation,'' Daft said. And then there is pride, he added, ``pride in
the company and pride in being asked to take this position.''
</P>
<P>
   The overtures to reporters and the discussion of his emotional
life are two signs of the difference between Daft's style and that
of his predecessor, M. Douglas Ivester, who stunned the business
world by announcing on Monday that he would step down.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that Coca-Cola will not operate so differently
under Daft. His mentors, he said, were Roberto C. Goizueta, the
chairman and chief executive who died in 1997, Ivester and Donald
R. Keough, the former president who now works for Allen &AMP; Co., the
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   He stands by the large price increases Coke recently instituted
for the concentrate it sells to bottlers in the United States, even
though many of them are irked. And he said he was committed to
increasing the number of cases sold by 7 percent to 8 percent and
earnings growth by 15 percent to 20 percent, even though many on
Wall Street doubt the company can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   The company whose corner office he will inhabit is tarnished
from a year of unprecedented regulatory difficulties, a racial
discrimination lawsuit filed by four current and former employees
and the biggest product recall in its history. The share price has
fallen 7 percent this year, and earnings have disappointed for the
last six quarters. Coca-Cola earns 75 percent of its profits
overseas; many of those markets have been gripped by recession or
monetary crises for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said we are in a period of readjustment,'' Daft said.
``The October and November results were ahead of the third quarter;
2000 is the year of the recovery for the world, and obviously our
business will be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts question whether Coca-Cola can grow at twice the
industry average. ``We've advised investors to wait out this period
of uncertainty, and we're waiting to get comfortable that Doug Daft
is not just going to keep the status quo,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a
beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   The issues facing Coca-Cola, he said, include figuring out how
to make the global bottler system profitable after a long period of
consolidation, as well as how to successfully sell Coke in regions
like Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia where cheaper
brands have chipped away at Coca-Cola's market share. And Coca-Cola
might be better off lowering expectations, which would affect share
price in the short term but redefine what growth means at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester was known as a brilliant tactician who preached an
aggressive growth plan and once made a speech before an industry
group in which he compared Coca-Cola to a wolf among sheep and
declared he wanted the entire soft-drink market, not just a share
of it. Part of his strategy included urging bottlers to consolidate
and exhorting ``anchor bottlers,'' the biggest, to invest heavily
in vending machines, production facilities and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the world, Coke's big bottlers have poor
returns on their invested capital because local fiscal crises have
cut demand for pricier American soft drinks. The bottlers in
trouble include Coca-Cola Beverages, based in London and operating
in Eastern Europe and Italy; Coca-Cola Amatil, based in Sydney and
operating in much of the Far East, and Pan American Beverages,
known as Panamco, which paid close to $1 billion for a bottling
company in Venezuela, soon before a major economic downturn there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make the bottler network sustainable,''
Pecoriello said. ``It can't be the Coca-Cola Company winning at the
expense of its bottlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he needed to mend fences with bottlers, whose
displeasure at the concentrate-price increases _ at 7 percent,
twice the typical rate _ likely did not go unnoticed by Coca-Cola's
board, Daft said he thought the situation had been overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have extremely strong relationships with all our partners
everywhere,'' he said. As for the price increases, he added: ``I
was well aware of the strategy in the U.S. and well aware of the
thinking behind it. And I totally agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has been in the business of making huge support
payments to its bottlers. Its largest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises in Atlanta, received just less than $1 billion last
year, without which the publicly traded bottler would have finished
the year in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Market support to bottlers will continue, Daft said, although he
did not give specifics. ``The market support is a critical part of
the relationship,'' he said. ``Each of the bottlers will continue
to get that support, and the level will depend on the local market
and local needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft told of meeting with Ivester last Friday night, in what he
thought was just a routine conversation with his boss. ``He called
me into his office and said to me, `Remember when we talked about
making life decisions?''' Daft said, adding that he had made one of
his own some six months earlier. ``And then he told me, `I've just
made one.' And he told me what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was ``sorrow and discussion,'' he added. ``And on
Sunday, he said to me, whatever happens I'm your friend. Both of us
were very emotional.''

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR TOPS PROFIT FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Semiconductor Corp. reported second
quarter earnings Thursday that exceeded analysts' estimates, as the
company continues on a recovery path. National had returned to
profitability in the previous period after five quarters of losses.
</P>
<P>
   National's strong showing partly results from its exit from the
personal computer microprocessor business, where it had been
bloodied in the price wars between the Intel Corp. and Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. But the results also reflect the large portion
of the company's revenues that come from analog devices, which are
used in cellular telephones, wireless computers and consumer
electronics products of all sorts. Analog sales are growing more
rapidly than digital sales.
</P>
<P>
   National's shares closed up $5, or 11 percent, at $51, on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended on Nov. 28, National reported
earnings of $92 million, or 49 cents a diluted share, compared with
a loss of $94.4 million in the comparable period a year ago. Sales
were essentially flat at $513.9 million, compared with $510.1
million in last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings in the latest quarter include after-tax gains of $28.4
million related to the sale of the Cyrix PC processor business,
offset partially by an after-tax extraordinary charge of $6.8
million resulting from the early repayment of $259 million in
convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding these items, National had earnings of $70.4 million,
or 37 cents a diluted share, in the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street expected National to earn 26 cents in the quarter,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quarter gets us off to a good start, not only from the
overall market robustness but also as a direct result of our
strategic positioning and our solid execution on cost
initiatives,'' said Brian L. Halla, National's chairman, president
and chief executive. ``Bookings, sales and earnings were well up,
led by our analog business.''
</P>
<P>
   National said its analog chip orders in the second quarter were
up about 60 percent from last year. Orders were particularly strong
for chips used to manage power supplies and amplify signals, and
for those used in wireless applications. The percentage gain in
analog orders from the previous quarter was in the mid-teens, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though strong analog sales are helping National at present, for
the long term the company is promoting its concept of a PC on a
chip, which reduces nearly all of the semiconductor components of a
personal computer to one chip.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile companies, including IBM and America
Online, have announced devices using the National chip, which could
be used in various information and computing appliances.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CREATING WIDELY SPREAD MELISSA VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A New Jersey man pleaded guilty Thursday to state
and federal charges that he created the most widely spread,
disruptive and costly computer virus in history, but he insisted
that he had had ``no idea'' that his Melissa virus would replicate
itself exponentially as it swept through more than a million
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a Monmouth County courthouse Thursday morning, and
being described later by his lawyer in U.S. District Court here,
the man, David Lee Smith of Aberdeen Township, was portrayed as the
creator of an innocuous program that did not destroy computer
programs and hardware or steal money, but simply disrupted those
systems. ``I did not anticipate and expect that amount of damage,''
said Smith, 31, as he answered questions from Judge John A.
Ricciardi in state Superior Court in Freehold. ``I had no idea that
there would be such profound consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Edward Borden Jr., said that while his client
was ``profoundly remorseful,'' his goal had simply been to
circulate ``a harmless, joke message.'' But law enforcement
officials assembled in the two courtrooms were not laughing. They
said that Smith had caused at least $80 million in disruption, lost
commerce and computer downtime as the virus made its way through
1.2 million computers in one-fifth of the country's largest
businesses, and even into the electronic mail systems of the Marine
Corps and NATO in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from being a mere nuisance, Melissa infected computers and
disabled computer networks throughout North America,'' said Robert
J. Cleary, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The New Jersey
attorney general, John Farmer, called the case the ``single most
significant Internet prosecution in the nation to date'' and an
indication of how aggressively law enforcement would pursue such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Borden said the determination of prosecutors to try his client
in both federal and state courts led to Smith's guilty plea, under
which some lesser state charges were dropped. Smith faces up to 10
years in prison and a $150,000 fine on the state charges when he is
sentenced on Feb. 22, and up to five years and a $250,000 fine on
the federal charges when he is sentenced in federal court on May
15.
</P>
<P>
   Peter S. Tippett, vice chairman of ICSAnet, a computer security
firm, told reporters outside the federal courthouse that the
company had research pointing to multiple Internet personalities
for Smith, including a record of five years of virus writing and
determined disruption. Tippett, whose firm helped law enforcement
officials quantify the virus' damage, said that in one persona
Smith was the virus writer ``VicodinEs,'' who bragged in the
cyberunderground about ``creating a ruckus'' in computer systems.
But he also surfaced as ``Doug Winterspoon,'' a free-lance
cyberdetective who offered people advice over the Internet on
detecting and debugging viruses, Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Borden denied that his client was also ``Doug Winterspoon,'' but
would not discuss whether Smith was ``VicodinES.''

MOTOROLA STEPS IN TO KEEP IRIDIUM GOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iridium LLC, the troubled global satellite
telephone venture, said Thursday that a group of investors led by
Motorola Inc. had agreed to commit $20 million so that the company
could continue operating through early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
August, said the money would allow it to operate through
mid-February and give its executives more time to develop a plan
for restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our existing investors have stepped forward to provide for
ongoing operations while we continue to have discussions with
potential new investors,'' John Richardson, the chief executive of
Iridium, said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have expressed an interest in taking a huge
stake in Iridium, based in Washington, is Craig O. McCaw, the
cellular telephone pioneer, who has been interested in gaining
control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium officials would not say who the potential investors are
and McCaw, who is a large investor in Teledesic LLC, the so-called
Internet in the Sky global satellite service that expects to begin
operating in 2004, was unavailable for comment Thursday. A month
ago, however, McCaw agreed to raise $1.2 billion to lift ICO Global
Communications, another global satellite telephone service, out of
Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the announcement Thursday suggested
that Motorola and others continued to believe that Iridium could be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that Motorola is holding out some hope,'' said Armand
Musey, an analyst at BancAmerica Securities. ``They could have
pulled the plug.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which helped develop the Iridium system, has continued
to back the venture despite criticism from some analysts earlier
this year and huge charges against earnings in recent quarters
because of financial commitments to the satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Motorola officials said they remained confident about
the viability of Iridium. ``Motorola is very encouraged by the way
Iridium LLC and its board of directors is working together to find
new investors that can help Iridium achieve a successful financial
restructuring,'' the company said in a statement. ``We hope today's
action will provide Iridium with the time it needs to complete that
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Motorola, however, said the company would stand by
its earlier statements about not committing significantly large
sums of money unless Iridium comes up with a convincing plan to
reorganize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not make any more significant contributions unless
there is a sound business plan and a sound management team and
appropriate financial participation by the other investing
partners,'' said Albert R. Brashear, a Motorola spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear also said Motorola would suspend operations of the
satellite service on Feb. 15 if a reorganization plan was not in
place. Motorola has been operating the service at no charge for
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Iridium also warned investors that once its
reorganization plan was announced, its shares might be worthless.
Shares of Iridium, which traded as high as $70 in May 1998, dropped
to about $3 after the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the shares have been delisted by the NASDAQ stock
market and now trade off the market in what is called the pink
sheets, a bulletin board for stock quotations operated by the
National Quotation Bureau Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has soared recently on speculation that McCaw could take
a stake in the company, but Iridium executives say that the
reorganization may not raise the value for shareholders because the
company has more than $4 billion in debt and legal priorities
related to the bankruptcy.

PANEL SAYS AIDS PROGRAMS FOR MINORITIES NEED MORE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state AIDS panel is urging leaders in Albany to
spend more money on AIDS and H.I.V. programs and services aimed at
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member AIDS Advisory Council, which advises the governor
and the Legislature on policy, also said in a report distributed at
its monthly meeting on Wednesday that more money was needed to pay
for better programs aimed at minorities, which have been
disproportionately affected by the disease in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had allocated $156 million for programs
that would specifically help minorities with AIDS or H.I.V., the
virus that causes AIDS, and more money would be added next year.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which distributed $250 million to state and local health
departments for AIDS prevention programs, required those
departments to allocate their portion of money in a way that
paralleled the disease. In other words, if 50 percent of a city's
AIDS patients are African-American, 50 percent of that city's money
from the C.D.C. must go to programs that serve those individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have said that new cases of H.I.V. are
dangerously high among minority gay men and heterosexual women,
especially minority women.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, for instance, Hispanics make up more than one
third of all AIDS cases, according to a report by the Latino
Commission on AIDS. While death rates from AIDS have slowed
nationally, those rates have fallen much more slowly among blacks.
In New York City from 1995 to 1998, AIDS deaths among white men
fell 83 percent but the rate declined by 75 percent among black
women.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that aim services at minorities are clamoring for a
larger proportion of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time now, there has been a lot of people bringing
concerns to us about how the epidemic has shifted so much to men
and women of color,'' said Allan Rosenfield, chairman of the
Columbia University School of Public Health and a member of the
advisory council. ``We need to focus our efforts on the group that
makes up the highest risk at the present time.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Daft's priority: Long-term growth
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Douglas Daft, the new president of Coca-Cola, said
Thursday that his greatest challenge will be to leave an indelible
mark on the company like his predecessors did _ and enjoy himself
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But first, ``I have to get through the next couple of days,''
Daft joked during his first round of media interviews since
becoming president and chief operating officer earlier this week.
The promotion was prompted by Chairman M. Douglas Ivester's
decision to retire in April, when Daft will take over that job.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, 56, reassured investors that the Atlanta-based beverage
giant is committed to building shareholder value over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't concentrate on the short-term swings in the (stock)
market,'' said the former head of Coca-Cola's Middle East, Far East
and Africa operations. ``The company is committed to its long-term
growth goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have questioned those goals, saying they are
overly ambitious and cannot be sustained. The goals include annual
average increases in global case sales of 7 percent to 8 percent,
as well as earnings-per-share growth of between 15 percent and 20
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Coca-Cola has been able to meet those goals
fairly consistently, propelling huge profits for its long-term
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the company has failed to hit those targets _
depressing its stock _ largely because of troubled economies in
parts of Asia, Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those economies have improved, Daft said, they
still have not fully gotten back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, he is convinced the good ol' days for Coke
shareholders will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities haven't changed,'' he said. ``We are
perfectly positioned to benefit'' from economic rebounds around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Daft said he will follow the advice of the
company's late chairman, Roberto C. Goizueta, who stressed the
value of focusing on a ``short and critical agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be developing that agenda after discussing key issues
with other senior executives, as well as by remembering a central
lesson he learned during his three decades with the company:
``Don't lose your intuition.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key issues he will be dealing with is whether to
appoint a president when he becomes chairman in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a critical issue, but it's too early to
comment,'' Daft said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester had been criticized by some analysts for not having a
No. 2. Some have said that a dispute over the issue with board
members may have prompted Ivester to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Daft emphasized the importance of building relationships. Some
analysts also have criticized Ivester for not doing enough of that,
saying that may have aggravated some of the company's recent
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a high value on people and relationships,'' Daft said.
``People are critical to my success. ... The consumer is king.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft also said building stronger ties with bottlers and
retailers will be an essential part of his job. He doesn't plan any
changes in the company's recent decision to raise the price of
concentrate it sells to bottlers to make soft drinks. That decision
caused bottlers to raise prices, especially in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of the company's largest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, has been taking a pounding lately. On Thursday, it
fell to another 52-week low before closing at $16.93 3/4, down
$1.06 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock, meanwhile, rose $1.62 1/2, closing at $62.12
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The shares got a boost from analyst David Goldman of Banc of
America Securities, who raised his rating to ``buy'' from ``market
perform.'' He predicted the shares will reach $75 within 12 months.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet mania reached new levels of frenzy
Thursday as investors paid huge multiples on an initial public
offering, giving a market value of almost $10 billion to a tiny
company with powerful competitors, little revenue and no
expectation of earnings in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The company, VA Linux Systems of Sunnyvale, sells computers
powered by standard Intel Pentium processors that run on Linux, the
free Unix-based operating system created by a Finnish graduate
student and now marketed by more than a dozen companies worldwide.
The computers are designed as servers, computers that deliver
Internet products, like Web pages and e-mail, or other network
services.
</P>
<P>
   Though giants like Dell Computer and IBM already market Linux
servers of similar power, shares of VA Linux Systems surged more
than eight-fold Thursday, setting a record for an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 4.4 million shares, an 11 percent stake, priced
at $30 a share, raising $132 million. The shares opened at $300,
and closed at $250 in Nasdaq trading, giving the tiny company a
market valuation of $9.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for shares of companies that deal in Linux products
and services has been enormous this year, and those stocks shared
in Thursday's largess. Shares in Red Hat, a Linux distributor, have
soared twenty-fold since the company went public Aug. 11 and rose
$15 to $286.20 Thursday. Andover.Net, which runs a network of Web
sites devoted to Linux, has more than quadrupled since its initial
offering on Wednesday, gaining $14.125, to close at $77.50. Corel
Corp., which sells software that runs on the Linux system, most
notably a Linux version of its WordPerfect document-creation
software, rose $10.9375, to $39.25, after trading as low as $2 in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux has never made money and does not expect to for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   As the company's prospectus points out: ``We do not expect to
generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability and,
therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses for at least
the foreseeable future. If we do achieve profitability, we may not
be able to sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said the stampeding market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stock like this is an obvious example of something going
through the roof with absolutely no underlying fundamentals,'' said
Michael C. Perkins, co-author of ``The Internet Bubble'' (Harper
Business, 1999). ``It starts with the institutions flipping the
stock, and then the momentum players and the day traders take over.
Just when you think you've seen the peak of the insanity, this is a
perfect bubble stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, has become a cause
celebre within an industry wary of Microsoft Corp.'s domination of
both operating systems, with Windows, and the business application
programs that run on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the darling of ``open source'' advocates. Open Source
is based on the concept that making a program's underlying code
freely available, and allowing it to be modified by anyone, will
result in a more powerful and secure system and will free consumers
from the tyranny of proprietary operating systems, especially
Windows. Linux grew out of the GNU Project, an effort to build a
free operating system similar to Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Linux kernel and associated GNU (pronounced NEW)
components can be downloaded for free by anybody, more than 22
companies now sell GNU/Linux software. The best known are Red Hat,
Suse, Turbo Linux, Caldera Systems and Mandrake Soft.
</P>
<P>
   As the notion that Linux could be a viable alternative to
Windows has gained currency, these companies have captured the
imagination of investors.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that notion was fed by Microsoft itself, which insisted
earlier this year in its antitrust battle with the government that
Linux threatened its Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were not there for the great IPO of the '80s see
this as an opportunity to ride the crest again, as Microsoft II,''
said Maureen O'Gara, publisher of Client Server News, a trade
publication. ``This is not based on fundamentals. They don't read
beyond the first page of the prospectus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of VA Linux, she said, ``The fact that they could be
crushed by one finger of Dell's hand has not slowed their flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of Linux-based computers are expected to grow by 25
percent from 1999 through 2003, more than twice the 10 percent to
12 percent pace for other workstation and server systems, according
to the International Data Corp., a market research firm based in
Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of increase is possible only because the market
today is so miniscule. Lost in the excitement about Linux is the
fact that the actual user base today is tiny compared with Windows,
commercial versions of the Unix operating system or Apple
Computer's Mac OS. Although Linux proponents often say that the
operating system is more reliable and secure than Windows NT, major
corporations have not been eager to run mission-critical
applications on Linux. Those that have embraced Unix are more
likely to purchase Solaris from Sun Microsystems, HP/UX from
Hewlett-Packard or other name brands.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux's biggest sales have been to Internet companies,
including Akamai Technologies, eToys, StarMedia Network, and 24/7
Media. Sales to these four customers accounted for 14.5 percent of
the company's total revenue in fiscal 1999 and 23.3 percent in the
first quarter of fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Linux is going to kill Microsoft, but I say, `How
do you do that without killing Sun first?''' said Michael Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. ``I don't think
they have any understanding of what Linux is, what it means, the
fact that it's free.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, VA Linux was represented by leading investment
banks, and had previously attracted savvy venture investors. Credit
Suisse First Boston was the lead underwriter, with Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and Lehman Brothers as the
co-managers of the offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company's backers include the Silicon Valley venture capital
firm Sequoia Capital, which holds a 23 percent stake, and Intel,
which holds an 8.9 percent stake.

UCONN MEN CLOSE IN ON SOCCER TITLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ In the early 1980s, the University of
Connecticut men's soccer team was a powerhouse. It won the national
championship in 1981 and reached the semifinals the next two years.
For the next 13 years, though, UConn was unable to even get past
the first round of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This season, UConn again has an elite program. The Huskies
(19-4) will enter Friday's Final Four matchup of the College Cup
against Santa Clara (15-3-3) riding a 12-game winning streak. Eight
of those victories have been shutouts, and the offense has scored
27 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana (19-3), the defending champion, will take on UCLA
(19-2), the winner of the NCAA title two years ago. The games will
be played at Ericsson Stadium in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ray Reid, who led Southern Connecticut State to three
Division II titles between 1990 and 1995, has revitalized the
Huskies' program in his third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no pressure on us from the school to do what
the men and women did in basketball,'' Reid said Thursday. ``The
only pressure we have is what we've put on ourselves. The school,
in fact, has given us great support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies rallied to eliminate Hartford, 2-1, in four
overtimes in the first round; defeated Yale, 3-0; and then had to
come back twice to defeat Furman, 3-2, in the quarterfinals last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't panic when we were down, and that's a testament to
our players,'' Reid said. All of UConn's victories came at home at
Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, making its second consecutive appearance in the
semifinals, opened the season with 11 victories, nine by shutout.
The Broncos may have an advantage over Connecticut because they
have played all their tournament games on the road. They eliminated
Stanford, top-ranked Duke and Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing every game on the road has certainly been challenging
for our team,'' coach Mitch Murray said. ``But we survived and our
team is in high spirits because we feel we have a lot of soccer
left to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said: ``Santa Clara is very well organized defensively, but
I don't expect them to sit back and play low pressure. Their
defense will be difficult to break down. We'll have to neutralize
them in transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's team, led by Luis Arauz and Daren Lewis, has the speed to
do damage. Arauz has scored 13 goals and Lewis has 10.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which eliminated Santa Clara in the semifinals last
year before beating Stanford in the championship game for its
fourth national title, struggled against Kentucky in the first
round before eliminating Washington and Penn State to reach the
semifinals for the 13th time under coach Jerry Yeagley.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, coached by Todd Saldana, is making its 10th appearance in
the semifinals. The Bruins have captured three titles and were
runners-up three times. They reached the semifinals this season by
defeating San Diego at home and St. Louis and Virginia on the road.

IRISH PARADE IS LATEST ISSUE FOR FIRST LADY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wading into one of the more complicated political
issues here, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that she would
like to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade in March, an event
that many Democrats have boycotted because the organizers exclude
gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   The remark threatened to dampen the enthusiasm that Mrs. Clinton
had fostered this week among an important New York voting bloc when
she announced her support for gays serving openly in the military.
Later, the spokesman for her U.S. Senate campaign seemed to
backpedal, suggesting that the first lady's presence in the parade
was not guaranteed and that she hoped it would not exclude anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made the comment as she sought to please
Irish-American political and community leaders, who surrounded her
at a news conference Thursday at a midtown restaurant. They took
note of her four trips to Ireland as first lady, and she promised,
if elected, to push for more aid to Northern Ireland as it moved
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she planned to march in the parade, which Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, her presumed Republican rival, has faithfully attended,
she beamed and replied, ``I would hope so.'' The remark drew
applause from the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I've got a lot of good company,'' she continued,
turning again toward the smiling group, ``I would certainly go
marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-floor lounge erupted in cheers, but Mrs. Clinton's
remarks appeared to take her aides by surprise. It also left other
Democrats and gay leaders wondering if she had stumbled on a land
mine.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is a magnet for politicians of all stripes, but in
recent years, several Democrats have boycotted it, because the
Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Roman Catholic fraternal group
that organizes the parade, forbids gay organizations to march under
their own banners.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Clinton's news conference, when reporters pointed out
the parade's political turmoil, her spokesman, Howard Wolfson,
said: ``It wasn't a firm commitment that she made. I think she said
she hoped to, and we will revisit the issue when we get closer to
St. Patrick's Day. We'll deal with Christmas first.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later telephone interview, he said Mrs. Clinton indeed
wanted to march but added that she hoped that the parade would be
inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders said they would seek to persuade Mrs. Clinton to
work with them to have gay groups included or, failing that, to
skip the parade.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Thomas Duane, a Manhattan Democrat who is gay, said,
``I think she probably does not know the depth of feeling
surrounding New York's St. Patrick's Day parade and its history.''

</HEADLINE>
 WITNESSES PLEAD FOR FALA (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By JERRY KAMMER 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  Phoenix - Former co-workers, rela
tives and friends implored a judge Thursday not to end Scott
Falater's life, which they said was exemplary until that bizarre
night in 1997 when he stabbed his wife to death.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was the most compassionate, caring boss that I've ever
had,'' said Wyvaughna Mullins, a shipping clerk at Motorola, where
Falater was an electronics engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the calm, level-headed one,'' said Michael
Vines, who befriended Scott and Yarmila Falater 20 years ago when
the couple were living in Illinois. ``He just had the greatest
heart of any man, I think, I have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins and Vines were two of 11 witnesses who testified on the
first day of a sentencing hearing for Falater, who was convicted in
June of first-degree murder. The 44-year-old father of two faces
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member jury rejected the defense claim that he was sleep
walking when he stabbed Yarmila dozens of times, dragged her into
the backyard pool and held her head underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his fate is in the hands of Judge Ronald Reinstein, who is
weighing the circumstances of the crime before deciding from three
options: the death penalty, life with no chance for parole, or life
with the possibility of parole after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Juan Martinez is attempt ing to convince Reinstein
that the murder meets the state death penalty standard because it
was ``especially heinous, cruel or depraved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense attorneys Mi chael Kimerer and Lori Voepel
argue that the ``mitigating circumstances'' in Falater's life
should persuade Reinstein to impose the least severe sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez launched the hearing by guiding a county medical
examiner through a graphic description of the 44 stab wounds that
punctured Yarmila Falater's upper body with a hunting knife.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was so fierce that two of the wounds penetrated to
the hilt of the 5-inch blade, according to the testimony of Dr. Ann
Bucholtz.
</P>
<P>
   Bucholtz, spoke in calm, clinical terms, holding up autopsy
photos and explaining that the cause of death was ``multiple stab
wounds with asphyxiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez attempted to establish the attack's cruelty by arguing
that Falater left his wife to die while he returned to the house,
washed the blood from his hands and arms and stashed his crimsoned
clothes in the wheel well of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   After Bucholtz's testimony, defense attorneys began questioning
their 20 witnesses. The testimonials about Falater's character will
resume Mon day.
</P>
<P>
   All expressed bewilderment about the killing and disbelief that
Falater acted consciously that night, after having what his two
teenage children said at trial was a calm dinner at home. All urged
the judge to spare the life of a man whose son and daughter have
already lost their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and Megan adore this man, and they need him desper
ately,'' said Cheri Allen, who knows the family through Mormon
Church activities. She described Falater as ``a kind, devoted,
loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez challenged all the defense witnesses. Some had only a
superfi cial acquaintanceship with the Fala ters, he said, and none
could truly understand what happened inside the Falater home.
</P>
<P>
   He said Falater was responsible for the suffering of Megan and
Michael, who were described by Falater's mother as ``devastated''
in the kill ing's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Thursday that the placid surface of the Falater
home concealed tensions and turmoil seething beneath.
</P>
<P>
   He described Yarmila as a strong-willed, independent woman who
re sented a church to which her hus band was devoted. He suggested
that Yarmila was weighing a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense witnesses said they saw no indication of
domestic stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was crazy about her,'' Allen said.

NEW YORK IS FIRST STATE WITH CANCER-RATE MAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Thursday became the first state to
produce maps showing the rates of some cancers, county by county,
but the maps were quickly dismissed as useless by some of the
people who conceived of the project.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by cancer survivors' groups and the Legislature,
the maps were to show cancer rates at a neighborhood level,
alongside known sources of serious air, water and soil pollution.
The idea was to identify possible environmental causes for ``cancer
clusters'' so that scientists could investigate and determine
whether there was a connection. Nothing like it had ever been
tried, except by amateurs at a local level.
</P>
<P>
   The maps released Thursday by the state Health Department do not
supply either half of the equation; they do not show sources of
pollution and do not show cancer rates at the local level, where
clusters might turn up. Dr. Antonia Novello, who became state
health commissioner this year, said the department would include
such information in future maps, though she could not say when.
</P>
<P>
   The data included in the maps is also not new. The department
has published county-level cancer rates for years, though officials
said that data had required some polishing before the maps could be
published. The maps can be viewed on the department's Web site, at
http://www.health.state.ny.us.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spent 18 months repackaging what they had before they
started, and they're dragging their feet on the important part,
which is the environmental risk factors,'' said Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, the author of the legislation that commissioned the maps.
``What they've produced is useless, and it can't be accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is controversial among scientists. Many believe that
there is no such thing as a residential cancer cluster, that
neighborhood variations are essentially random. Others contend that
such clusters do exist, though they are exceedingly hard to prove,
and that detailed maps can be a start down that road. (Some
occupational cancer clusters, like those among asbestos workers and
coal miners, are well documented.)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's administration has been uncomfortable with
the project from the start. Administration officials have voiced
fears that detailed maps could prompt people to leap to conclusions
about cause and effect. Real estate interests and corporations
responsible for significant pollution have lobbied against the
effort, fearing that it could result in lawsuits or reduced
property values.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, the Legislature mandated the maps and included
money for them in the state budget, but Pataki vetoed the spending
item. Then, in the face of criticism from cancer survivors' groups,
he ordered the Health Department to proceed with the effort. The
Legislature renewed the mandate in this year's budget, which the
governor signed.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department has long operated a cancer registry,
collecting information on people who get cancer diagnoses.
Advocates of the mapping project assert that maps comparing that
information, by ZIP code, with known major sources of pollution
could be completed in a matter of days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Novello said Thursday that the cancer registry data, which
was a few years old, needed updating and that duplications had to
be eliminated before maps could be made. But the same data included
in the maps issued Thursday was posted on the department's Web site
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cornell University researchers, using the state's data,
posted a county-level breast cancer map of the state early this
year, which can be seen on their Web site,
http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/bcerf. This week, the National Cancer
Institute published a set of county-by-county cancer mortality maps
covering the entire country, which are posted on the institute's
Web site, http://www.nci.nih.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The maps released Thursday show rates of breast, lung, and colon
and rectal cancers, among the most common types, from 1992 through
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer has become a potent political issue on Long
Island, where its incidence is relatively high. But the state's
data showed that the highest rate, nearly 30 percent above the
state average, was in Rockland County. Rockland is high in many
known risk factors for the disease: it is affluent, has a heavy
Jewish population, and women there tend to begin having children at
a later age.
</P>
<P>
   The highest rates of lung cancer and colon and rectal cancer
were in mostly rural counties in central and northern New York, a
pattern officials said they could not explain. New York City had
below-average rates for all three groups, though in each case,
Staten Island had above-average rates.

GM SAID TO BE READY TO BUY STAKE IN PARENT OF SUBARU 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Seeking to help its business at home while building
its tiny market share in Asia, the General Motors Corp. is expected
to announce that it will pay $1.4 billion for 20 percent of Fuji
Heavy Industries, the Japanese maker of Subaru vehicles, people
close to the talks said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which could be announced as early as Friday, would
allow GM to share Subaru's expertise in all-wheel-drive systems for
small cars, its engineering work on car-based sport utility
vehicles and its technology for continuously variable
transmissions. In addition, GM might tap into Fuji's distribution
system in Japan, where it has struggled to sell cars for years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts shrugged off the deal as a minor one for GM. ``It would
be a rounding error for GM in terms of the cost, in terms of the
earnings effect and in terms of the effect on their business,''
said David B. Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. ``It could
give them a source of engines and maybe save them some development
costs and maybe give them a toehold in the Asia-Pacific market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, GM's market share in the region was 4.6
percent. In the first nine months of this year, GM's revenue in the
Asia-Pacific region was $2.25 billion, and it lost $195 million on
the business. Those figures are dwarfed by GM's nine-month revenue
of $112.63 billion and net income of $4.86 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM acknowledged late Thursday that it had been negotiating with
Fuji about ``a strategic alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been considerable momentum with those talks, but
there is nothing firm to announce at this point,'' Anthony Cervone,
a GM spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuji deal may not be the last for GM, or for other
automakers looking for more business in Asia. With the recovering
Japanese economy helping regional economies rebound across Asia,
Detroit's carmakers are busy trying to forge links through
investments and other alliances.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Ford Motor executive traveled to South Korea to
meet with bankers there. GM has spent 22 months negotiating with
Daewoo, the country's No. 2 automaker, over whether to take a stake
in the company, which is in financial difficulty. But the bankers
asked Ford whether it was interested in Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ford told the bankers ``we are always interested in subjects
under the right conditions,'' W. Wayne Booker, a Ford vice
chairman, said in an interview Thursday night. He cautioned that
Ford had yet to hold talks with Daewoo. ``We haven't made any
proposals to anybody,'' Booker said.
</P>
<P>
   Like GM, Ford has looked to alliances with other automakers to
try to increase its market share in the Asia-Pacific region. Ford
will not disclose its country-by-country 10-year goals, but GM has
said it wants to increase its market share in the region to 10
percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   GM has not broken off its talks with Daewoo. Ford's interest
could force a decision on the matter soon if it does not derail the
GM talks. GM signed a memorandum of understanding with Daewoo in
February 1998 that laid the groundwork for discussions about a
deal, with a second memorandum of understanding signed in August.
</P>
<P>
   GM's long discussions with Daewoo have run aground because GM
wants to avoid acquiring any of Daewoo's enormous debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan also owns a 4 percent stake in Fuji, and is negotiating
whether to sell that stake to GM, people close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   The GM deal to buy a fifth of Fuji would be just the latest in a
wave of cross-border alliances in the auto industry. Last year,
Daimler-Benz of Germany bought the Chrysler Corp., the smallest of
Detroit's Big Three. Earlier this year, Ford bought Volvo of
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   GM itself last year raised its stakes in Isuzu Motors Ltd. and
the Suzuki Motor Corp. to 49 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
In the coming months, GM may also buy the piece of Saab it does not
already own.

BROOKS REDUX IN PITTSBURGH WITH A NOD TO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty winters ago, when Herb Brooks was on top of the world, he
was a man ahead of his time. He had a global perspective on hockey
and the imagination to make it fun to play and to watch. He coached
the U.S. Olympic team that upset the powerful Soviet Union and went
on to win the gold medal at Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Sports Illustrated rightly judged the unlikely
triumph of Brooks' American team to be the greatest moment in 20th
century sports. Greater than Louis over Schmeling or DiMaggio's
hitting streak or Roger Bannister's four-minute mile or anything
offered by football, basketball, tennis, golf or horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Push the fast-forward button now to the season of 1999-2000.
After coaching the Rangers for four years, the Minnesota North
Stars for one and the Devils for one, Brooks had been working as a
scout for the Pittsburgh Penguins. He served as coach of France, a
second-tier Olympic team, in the 1998 Winter Games in Japan. At age
62, he seemed to be putting in his time until retirement, sometimes
edgy and maybe a little bitter about the way both amateur and
professional hockey have evolved in North America. He was due to
resurface in a few weeks only for another round of interviews on
the Olympic anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   And, suddenly _ do you believe in miracles? _ Brooks is back
behind a National Hockey League bench for the first time since
1993. The Penguins named him to replace Kevin Constantine, and
Brooks coached Thursday night in Pittsburgh against Washington. He
has an important job with a troubled franchise. The team lost its
previous three games and was 8-14-3. After enduring a year of
bankruptcy, the Penguins were bought by Mario Lemieux, their former
star, who took control mainly to recover about $30 million owed to
him. Penguins attendance is down and payroll limitations have
forced a few personnel moves.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Brooks suggests many things, including
desperation. What if Brooks, two decades removed from his great
triumph, proves himself to be behind the times? Some of his new
players were toddlers that memorable week in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was hired by General Manager Craig Patrick, his assistant
coach on the American Olympic team. A skeptic can speculate about
cronyism and panic. But a romantic can hope that this is the
perfect move at the perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   In a league plagued by boring, defensive strategies, Brooks
takes over a team filled with Europeans schooled in puck skills and
playmaking. Forwards such as Jaromir Jagr and Aleksei Kovalev could
discover a coach who reminds them of their ``trainers'' in Europe.
A successful team in Pittsburgh, with a dynamic style under a
legendary coach, could help produce the shift in personality that
the league needs as it enters a new year, decade and century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb is a perfect fit for what we are trying to achieve
here,'' Patrick said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``I know
his hockey mind. He is always at the cutting edge of what is going
on in hockey. He always will be. He has a brilliant hockey mind.
Lots of teams are finding ways to beat the trap. I know him. He
will be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks promised his team will play ``an up-tempo, dynamic
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ice out there, not blacktop, wood or dirt,'' Brooks said
at the midday news conference to announce his hiring. ``The first
thing is to get back to even and play a type of game that fits into
the abilities of the players we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux did not attend the news conference, held across the
street from team offices. But he approved Patrick's decision. And
more fresh ideas could come from the 34-year-old owner.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux suggested that a cure for empty seats and low television
ratings might be to use an international-sized rink, 100 feet wide
instead of 85, the kind used in the Olympics and in Europe. More
space could mean more creativity. But might some owners not wish to
remove seats for a bigger playing surface?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you look around the league, there's not too many
teams selling out every game,'' Lemieux said. ``So, to make our
product better, if we have to take some seats out and, by doing
that, selling out most of the buildings, it makes more sense. All
I'm trying to do is make the game more fun for the players, the
fans and for the viewers on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept. It is the kind of talk heard 20 winters ago,
when Herb Brooks was golden and hockey hoped to make its great leap
forward.

ITALIANS INTRODUCE `SMART' WASHER WITH THE INTERNET IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Now, for the homemaker who truly has everything _
cyberlaundry.
</P>
<P>
   With the free-spending Christmas shopper as the target audience,
an Italian appliance maker Thursday put on sale a washing machine
that uses wireless telephone technology and a modem to communicate
with the manufacturer and the owner, and hat will in the future be
able to chat electronically with other appliances around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The vaguely retro-looking whitewasher, the Margherita2000.com,
is the product of Merloni Elettrodomestici S.p.A., which ranks
alongside Whirlpool of the United States as Europe's third-largest
appliance maker, after Electrolux of Sweden and Bosch-Siemens of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Margherita, a front-loading model that
retails for as much as $1,400, is Merloni's attempt to get a head
start on its big international rivals.
</P>
<P>
   As the use of the Internet and wireless phones spreads through
Europe, the Continent's consumer electronics makers are hustling to
create so-called smart appliances that can join the chatter. Last
month, Electrolux announced a joint venture with Ericsson, the
Swedish company known for cellular phones, to develop smart
appliances and the home networking they require. Electrolux plans
to have its first smart appliance, a refrigerator that can order
groceries through the Internet and is known as the Screenfridge, on
sale by next year. Siemens-Bosch has linked up with Sun
Microsystems to pursue similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excitement and white goods used to be an oxymoron,'' said
Francesco Caio, the former chief of the Olivetti computer group who
is now Merloni's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's introduction in Italy, Margherita is to be
offered in the spring in Britain and later in the year in France,
Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the push toward smart appliances are clear.
Three years ago, when Caio took over at Merloni, the European
appliance industry was burdened by stagnant sales and enormous
overcapacity, despite the opening of fresh markets in
post-Communist Eastern Europe. Electrolux soon announced an
ambitious five-year plan to cut 12,000 jobs and close 25 factories,
mainly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   European energy and water prices are high, and smart appliances
operate efficiently. They also put less of a strain on the
environment. But what attracts manufacturing executives like Caio
is the potential ability to create an array of related information
services around smart appliances and the networks that link them,
enabling the appliance makers to increase their revenue beyond what
they collect on the appliances themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Mosca, Merloni's director of innovative product
development, taps keys on his wireless phone to ask Margherita when
it has been set to begin the wash cycle. If he puts in too much
detergent, or sets the temperature too high for the cashmere he is
washing, the machine sends a warning message over the Internet to a
manufacturer's Web site, where Mosca can use a code and a password
to call it up. If Margherita's internal sensors note that one of
the components is about to go out, the machine informs a customer
service center so that timely repairs can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Using his cell phone, Mosca can now do little more than start
and stop the machine and tell it to change the preset starting
time. That is because the controls on Margherita are still
conventional analog controls, which consumers prefer.
Future-generation machines will be designed to respond to a broader
array of commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a work in progress,'' Mosca said.
</P>
<P>
   And Margherita has other talents. Sensors in the tumbler measure
the conductivity of the rinse water, enabling the machine to shut
off the rinse cycle as soon as all the detergent is dissolved.
Fuzzy logic enables the microchips to tell fabrics apart _
distinguishing, say, between cotton and wool, and to know whether
the right amount of detergent or water softener was used.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Thursday, though, Merloni had sold none of its
machines, though some people who browsed were clearly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanna Cecchi, an accountant in her 30s, said she liked the
idea of operating the machine remotely by cell phone. ``If you
leave wet wash in your machine all day,'' she said, ``it comes out
with a funny odor.''
</P>
<P>
   The price, she acknowledged, was ``a bit above the average,''
but the convenience for a working homemaker who uses the Internet
anyway she found ``pretty interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni, which does not sell appliances in the United States,
says it sees a market for its software package among American
appliance makers, who are expected to offer their own lines of
smart appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen huge interest yet,'' said Jill Notini,
spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in
Washington. But she added, ``We'll see; give it another year. I
think you have a first here.''
</P>
<P>
   Per Grunewald, president of Electrolux's new joint venture with
Ericsson, said that ``potentially, the United States is one of our
first markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Notini conceded she was unsure just how American consumers
would take to a machine that evaluated its owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd kill it,'' she said. ``How dare an appliance talk back?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cecchi said she liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a grandmother, telling you how to do the wash
better,'' she said.

FORBES OFFERS UP SPECIFICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix - Presidential candidate Steve Forbes on Thursday
defended his aggressive plan to privatize Social Security and said
problems created by a transition period for the newly revamped
program could be solved with long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with ``The Arizona Republic'' editorial board,
Forbes defended his plan to allow citizens to invest Social
Security funds in their own retirement accounts and said some of
the costs associated with introducing the plan could be paid for
with the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need to issue bonds to pay benefits, those bonds could
be financed at 4.4 percent long term, amortized over 40 years, and
still make the thing work,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been criticized by other GOP presidential candidates,
most vocally Gary Bauer, for failing to adequately explain how his
plan would be funded.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bonds, the new system would be paid for with
gains in worker productivity and spending caps, according to
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any kind of decent economic policy, the monies are
there to aggressively phase in this new system,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview, Forbes also said the problems
associated with illegal immigration should be laid at the doorstep
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and he called for
increased border operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to use the military, you just need to have the
INS get its act together,'' Forbes said, referring to the call by
some conservatives to use the military to stanch the flow of
illegal immigrants across the border.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent Arizona poll, conducted for ``The Republic,''
Texas Gov. George W. Bush led Arizona Sen. John McCain, 40 percent
to 36 percent, with Forbes in third place at 7 percent. The survey
had a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points. Despite his
third-place position, Forbes is competing heavily in the state's
primary, which he won during the 1996 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the campaign, Forbes sought Wednesday to
put daylight between his proposals and those of the front-runner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine publisher critiqued Bush's education proposal,
which would require states to establish minimum testing standards
to be reviewed by the federal government, as too bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long after Mr. Bush takes that office, if (he) takes that
office, bureaucracies will take on a life of their own,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes, his own plan to send education block grants
to states that agree to offer school choice is the more
conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also defended his recent support of allowing schools to
post the Ten Commandments, which he called ``the core of Western
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a particular religion,'' he said of the Bible tenets.
``It's the core of who we are and what we are.'' &QL;

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Riding a horse named I Be Casual past the
finish of Thursday's fourth race at Hollywood Park, narrowly a
winner for a record-tying 8,833rd time, Laffit Pincay waved his
whip overhead left-handed and called out to the beaten jockeys, ``I
got it! I got it!''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is even more rare than a flashy expression of
personal triumph by the normally stoic Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Berrio, riding the runner-up, raised his whip overhead. Pat
Valenzuela, aboard the third-place finisher, lifted his. And with
arms aloft, the three jockeys faded into the distance _ the one in
gold and green galloping into history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for (Pincay),'' Berrio said later, explaining why
he celebrated after losing a hard-fought race by a head after
leading yards from the wire. ``When I was a little boy, watching TV
in Panama, Laffit was my idol.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if everybody in the small but noisy crowd at
Hollywood Park felt like the fawning Berrio on the cool, clear
afternoon when Pincay, 52, equaled Bill Shoemaker's mark for
lifetime riding victories, setting the stage for a possible
tie-breaker today.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay got a hero's welcome as he jogged I Be Casual back to the
winner's circle while an Olympian fanfare blared from the
loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot damn, that was exciting!'' fellow Hall of Famer Chris
McCarron said, sprinting out from the jockeys' room to greet Pincay
with a shout of ``All right, Laffit!'' and a pat on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, Laffit!'' growled Jack Van Berg, I Be
Casual's Hall of Fame trainer, offering a handshake. Pincay beamed
and stroked the horse's mane.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Hollywood Park jockeys stormed out of their
locker room as the fans in the weekday crowd of 5,578 pressed
against the rail above the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laffit, you're the best athlete in the world!'' a man in the
crowd yelled as the winner's circle photographs were snapped,
Pincay and I Be Casual surrounded by his family, rival jockeys and
the horse's owners and handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Dismounting, Pincay was scooped up by the other jockeys and
carried to the scale to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to throw me in another cake,''
Pincay said later, referring to a past occasion when the jockeys
dumped the fanatical dieter in a huge sheet cake.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to the winner's circle for a formal ceremony
that included the wheelchair-bound Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park president Rick Baedeker congratulated Pincay ``on
behalf of all the racing fans here.''
</P>
<P>
   Baedeker unveiled a $10,000 check, a donation by racetracks to
the Shoemaker Foundation, established following the jockey's 1991
auto accident to aid injured horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's agent, Bob Meldahl, fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten to the top of the mountain, but he needs one more
to be up there by himself,'' Shoemaker said into a crackling
microphone. ``I'm rooting for him. Go get 'em, Laffit!''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay answered: ``I just (tied) the record of the greatest
rider who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   How much sweeter can it get when Pincay actually breaks the
record?
</P>
<P>
   It could happen today, when he's scheduled to ride in five of
Hollywood Park's eight races, although none of his horses is
favored on the morning line. It could happen Saturday, when he has
mounts in six of the nine races.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay tied the record by posting a single winner for the fifth
straight day, this time with a swooping rally from sixth aboard I
Be Casual, a gray 3-year-old gelding who'd been winless in 11
previous races under other jockeys. Whipping left-handed, he pushed
his horse's head in front of Berrio's AJ Flyer a few strides from
the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, bet down from a 2-1 morning line, paid $4.40. This
was the 44,640th ride of Pincay's career; Shoemaker had 40,350.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to win easy,'' Pincay said of the moment
when he angled I Be Casual out from behind other horses at the top
of the stretch. ``That other horse kept fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The win came on the second of Pincay's five tries Thursday. He
picked up a promising mount, Bob Baffert-trained De Witt at 2-5
odds in the second race, after Emile Ramsammy complained of an
upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics grumbled that the publicity-conscious Baffert
orchestrated the switch, but their speculation was moot after De
Witt finished second. A good thing, perhaps, because Pincay's wife
and children hadn't arrived at the track yet.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay finished sixth, seventh and fifth in three later tries.
The real celebration awaits.

ENRIQUE IGLESIAS: MAKING A CONNECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enrique Iglesias is running late _ very late.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be an earth-shattering surprise in a celebrity's
world of late-night concerts, autograph sessions and interviews,
but this Latin crooner has a legitimate excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias was en route to Paris recently to promote ``Enrique,''
his first English-language album, when the flight he was on
unexpectedly took a disaster-movie turn for the worse. And we're
not talking turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front window _ the cockpit window _ broke,'' said Iglesias
when he finally called from his safe hotel room in Paris. ``We were
at 35,000 feet. Emergency landing! Emergency landing!''
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias comes to Houston on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias' last local appearance was in March during the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo, where more than 56,000 people swooned to
his lush love songs. Some were so overcome by Iglesias' presence at
the Astrodome that they dived over guardrails and chased the singer
as he was leaving the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hilarious. You should've seen the bulls. Suddenly you
felt like the bulls were the audience,'' Iglesias said, recalling
the stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I jumped in the truck, there were already hundreds
of girls running all over the place and holding onto the truck.
Cops running all over the place. ... And the girls are actually
punching the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a reaction is typical at this entertainer's concerts, which
rely more on raw emotion and personal connection than the
prepackaged spectacle of Ricky Martin, Latin music's current king.
</P>
<P>
   The teary-eyed hysteria suits Iglesias just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the worst thing a girl can do? They're going to
scratch you? Give me a break. They're my audience,'' Iglesias said.
``They're not going to kill me. Thank God that happens. The day I
have to worry is the day that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old singer and songwriter won't have to worry about
fans losing interest anytime soon. Since the release of his first
Spanish-language album in 1995, Iglesias has sold more than 14
million albums, scored more than a dozen No. 1 singles, and earned
a Grammy and an American Music Award.
</P>
<P>
   This year brought the flamenco-flavored ``Bailamos,'' his first
English-language chart-topper, on the ``Wild Wild West''
soundtrack. It resulted in a fierce bidding war that incited
interest from Maverick, Madonna's record label.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias eventually signed a $40 million multi-album deal with
Universal/Interscope. He completed his ``Enrique'' album in a mere
two months, and no expense was spared on the glittering collection.
</P>
<P>
   It features credits from such big-league players as producers
Mark Taylor and Brian Rowling, David Foster, songwriter Diane
Warren and Whitney Houston, who joins Iglesias for a duet, ``Could
I Have This Kiss Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Arista Records (Houston's label) president Clive Davis suggested
the collaboration to Iglesias after Houston said she loved the
song, too. Because of conflicting schedules, the song was recorded
over the phone using Integrated Services Digital Network
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in Germany, and I was in L.A. I never met her, but
I've seen her on TV,'' Iglesias said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias co-wrote five tracks on his album, including the
sensual first single, ``Rhythm Divine.'' The video is in heavy
rotation on MTV, and the album entered Billboard's charts at a
modest No. 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's stupid, but it's what I call a happy album,''
Iglesias said. ``The songs I wrote, they're pretty positive. They
leave you in a good mood.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best moments on the album is Iglesias' hushed version
of ``Sad Eyes,'' a song originally featured on Tracks, Bruce
Springsteen's collection of outtakes and rarities. Interscope
president Jimmy Iovine, who has produced Springsteen, brought the
song to Iglesias' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I was a big Bruce Springsteen fan,'' Iglesias said.
``I listened to the song, and I fell in love with it. I'm like,
`How am I going to do a Bruce Springsteen song?' But I went into
the studio with a bunch of great musicians I liked, and I produced
it with a friend of mine (Lester Mendez). I did it kinda my way.''
</P>
<P>
   While the label ``crossover'' has been slapped on every artist
with the slightest Latin appeal, Iglesias isn't afraid to label his
accessible sound as pure pop. His influences _ Springsteen, Billy
Joel, Lionel Richie, the Police _ reflect that.
</P>
<P>
   Producers Taylor and Rowling, known collectively as Metro,
ushered galloping dance beats and pop smarts into four tracks on
Iglesias' album. (They are also responsible for ``Believe,'' Cher's
techno-tinged comeback.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did in Spanish was mainstream,'' Iglesias said.
``That's where my focus was on this album. I wanted to do a
mainstream pop album in English. I'm Latino _ that's what makes it
Latino. Anything that has Jennifer, Ricky _ they even stuck
Christina Aguilera in it _ it's really pop. You cannot be No. 1 in
the United States if you're not mainstream. It all comes down to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Iglesias aiming for U.S. stardom, he'll be going
head-to-head with Martin and Marc Anthony, who beat him to the
male-heartthrob punch with full-length albums earlier this year.
Iglesias concedes, however, that there is room for everyone on the
charts and in the hearts of music listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's only a few of us out there, it's just going to be a
trend,'' Iglesias said. ``But at the end, what I love about it,
what matters, is the album. People don't get in their cars, turn on
the radio and say, `Oh, it's Latino time; let's buy that song.' If
a song is good, it will do good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides a slate of radio promotion shows and TV appearances,
Iglesias isn't planning a full-scale tour any time soon. His
worldwide ``Cosas del Amor'' outing wrapped up in May, and he won't
hit the road again until next September, when more singles will
have been released from his English-language album.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he should have plenty of time to prepare himself for
any potential outbreak of frenzied fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my audience. I feel so protected when I'm around
them,'' Iglesias said. ``You can't really explain what you feel.
That's what pushes you. That's when you say, `All the work, all the
traveling, all the interviews, all those sleepless nights, all
those hotels, all that _ it's all worth it as long as you feel
that.'''

implored a judge Thursday not to end Scott Falater's life, which
they said was exemplary until that bizarre night in 1997 when he
stabbed his wife to death. The 44-year-old father of two faces the
death penalty after a jury rejected his sleepwalking defense. Story

BRITISH ACTRESS DRAWS CRITICS' PRAISE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you are a respected British actress, well known on
English television and the stage, and a Broadway Tony Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you land a good leading role in an American movie _ a
low-budget independent film, to be sure, but still ... You shoot
the movie, and it's about to arrive in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   So, what do you most not want to hear?
</P>
<P>
   Well, how about this? Just before your movie, ``Tumbleweeds,''
is to be released, another movie will come out with a similar plot
and theme.
</P>
<P>
   And this other movie, ``Anywhere but Here,'' is a big-budget,
highly advertised Hollywood production.
</P>
<P>
   And the role parallel to the one you play is handled in the
other movie by Susan Sarandon, not only a star but also one of the
most respected performers around.
</P>
<P>
   If actress Janet McTeer fretted at all about this seeming
misfortune, she's fretting no more. Not only has ``Tumbleweeds''
and her performance gotten better reviews than ``Anywhere but
Here'' and the estimable Sarandon, but McTeer is also widely
considered a strong dark-horse contender for an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times called her work as an American Southern mom
who runs away from relationships ``not a performance at all but a
kind of spontaneous alchemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine said she is ``a wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luminous, haunting, electrifying,'' Rolling Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess, McTeer finds this overwhelming response
quite gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, yeah,'' she said. ``Poof. You kidding? I thought they
were going to laugh me off the screen. Some silly British actresses
doing a silly voice. I'm delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   McTeer, 37, was calling from her home in London. She had just
returned there from a busy U.S. visit and sounded relaxed. In fact,
in the middle of the conversation she interrupted herself to say,
``I'm now lying down on the sofa,'' and giggle, ``If you hear a
little pause, I've fallen asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she sounds not at all like her ``Tumbleweeds''
character, Mary Jo Walker, who hails from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And let's take this moment to say, with gratitude, that her
Southern accent in the movie is subtle, not the heavy-syruped
unreal drawl of so many actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's a very large place, but in actual fact they have
very few accents. Whereas England is a tiny, tiny place, and we
have many, many, many accents. I grew up in York, and five miles
away the accent's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now live in London, and there are four different London
accents. When English people are children, their ear becomes
attuned to many different accents. That's my latest theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she has worked mainly in England, McTeer made an impact
here in 1997, when her Broadway debut in ``A Doll's House'' won the
Tony Award and several other drama prizes. She earned additional
honors in England when the play was staged in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' is about a mother-daughter relationship between
Mary Jo and her teen-ager, Ava (played by Kimberley Brown). Of the
two, Ava is definitely the more stable; she yearns to stay in one
place and form friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo, however, is an emotional, free-spirited but confused
adult with a talent for picking the wrong men. The idea that she
might have a relationship with a man and be friends with him, too,
is outside her comprehension. When things turn uncomfortable in an
affair, she's out the door and on the road, dragging Ava along.
</P>
<P>
   The film is directed by Gavin O'Connor, who plays one of Mary
Jo's bad choices, and written by O'Connor and his former wife,
Angela Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is inspired by Angela's life,'' McTeer said. ``She
went across the country (as a child) with her mum. Eleven times, in
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   McTeer did some serious, and not so serious, preparation for
playing the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked a lot to Angela and her mum. I went to North Carolina
and stayed with some of Angela's relatives, who were wonderfully
hospitable. Lovely people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent time going around, talking to people and watching
everybody, observing. I read some Southern novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have watched `Coal Miner's Daughter' and `Sweet Dreams'
and `Bastard Out of Carolina' at least 6 million times.''
</P>
<P>
   But she came to the decision that playing Mary Jo as a
Southerner was not the most important part of the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's universal,'' McTeer said. ``People are people are people
across the world. We all really want the same things: to be loved,
to be understood, to find peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle of being a mother who is trying to bring her
daughter up and trying to have a life at the same time is totally
universal.''
</P>

TRYING TO PUT `OUT OF PRINT' BACK IN PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of the nation's leading book industry players
announced separate plans Thursday to invest in new instant printing
technology that will resurrect out-of-print titles and lead toward
more electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble said it had struck an agreement with IBM to
provide print-on-demand equipment for its distribution centers,
which will allow the No. 1-ranked bookstore chain to quickly
convert digital books into conventional print versions one at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, Random House Inc. _ the largest trade book
publisher in the United States and a unit of Bertelsmann _ said it
was also preparing to invest in state-of-the art equipment for its
national distribution center in Westminster, Md., that will begin
operation in March or April. But unlike Barnes &AMP; Noble, it has not
yet struck a deal with any of the major manufacturers of the
equipment like Xerox or IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Book buyers may not immediately notice the impact of the
equipment, but ultimately it means that the depth and selection of
titles will increase because publishers will be able to maintain
titles economically in digital form, printing titles out in short
runs according to demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are roughly 1.3 million titles considered in
print, and some 90,000 books are put out of print each year,'' said
Stephen Riggio, vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble. ``We think that's
a travesty. The technology enables us to declare that the words
`out of print' should be obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble has a business tie to The New York Times, selling
books through links from the newspaper's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said the company expected to start offering a range of
services to publishers early next year. It has already been working
with a pilot group of five small and large publishers to identify
titles, said Riggio, who added that the company was ``not ready to
talk about'' whether there would be a price for such services.
</P>
<P>
   Random House is going through the first round of examining its
out-of-stock titles, which could be brought back to life in digital
form and printed with the new technology, said Erik Engstrom,
president and chief operating officer for Random House.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a backlist of more than 20,000 titles, but
estimates that there are as many as 50,000 titles that are no
longer in stock that could be revived, Engstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this will be invisible to the reader,'' he added.
``The only thing a reader is interested in is whether they can find
a book or not. With this equipment, we'll have the ability to print
any book in our database whenever we want it. When we have this new
printer, we'll also have the ability to turn everything around
faster.''

SALTON INC. PAYS $137.5 MILLION FOR GEORGE FOREMAN'S NAME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (rk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if George Foreman's association with hamburger
grills will last longer and pay better than his last comeback as a
prizefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Salton Inc., a maker of housewares, said Thursday it would pay
$137.5 million in cash and stock for worldwide rights to use the
former heavyweight boxing champion's name and image to sell
food-preparation products, including indoor and outdoor grills. The
company said it would give Foreman and two business partners shares
of Salton worth $23.5 million and five annual cash payments of
$22.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman will receive about 75 percent of the payout, which is
structured as a long-term capital gain to reduce the sellers' tax
liability, said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. He estimated that Foreman's total income from his
association with Salton will exceed $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, who started out as a scowling sourpuss in the ring, has
carved out a lucrative second career as a large, lovable pitchman
since he returned to boxing in 1987 after a 10-year hiatus. After
34 more fights, including an improbable victory in a world
heavyweight title bout when he was 45, Foreman, now 50, retired
again two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has appeared in TV ads for Meineke mufflers
and Pepsi, as well as infomercials for Salton's Lean Mean Grilling
Machine. ``He's not fighting, but he's a pretty popular guy,''
William Rue, Salton's president, said. ``He's been very
instrumental in the company's growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The line of products Salton sells under the Foreman name has
become the company's biggest source of revenue, said Leon Driemann,
Salton's chief executive. As part of the agreement, Foreman will
``continue to assist us in our marketing effort,'' Driemann said.
</P>
<P>
   Driemann said he expected the agreement to add ``significantly''
to the company's earnings because Salton will no longer have to pay
60 percent of the profits from the sale of Foreman appliances to
Foreman and his partners. Driemann said that under the agreement,
which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2000, the
company, which is based in Mount Prospect, Ill., will not pay
royalties on sales of the Foreman products starting last July.

   Salton's earnings will get a lift this quarter when the company
reverses more than $16 million in expenses it booked last quarter
for royalties on the Foreman products, Schaeffer said. In addition,
not having to pay royalties on sales during the holiday season
should add $20 million more to Salton's operating profit this
quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer, the analyst, said that sales of the Foreman grills
started slowly in 1995 and amounted to only about $5 million in
1996. Then they soared to $200 million in 1998, making them one of
the best-selling lines of small kitchen appliances on the market,
he said. He estimated that they account for about 37 percent of
Salton's sales.

   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats have complained to the Federal
Election Commission that the National Republican Congressional
Committee is violating federal election law by giving money to
three nonprofit groups linked to Rep. Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee called for an immediate investigation, saying that the
groups ``are established, financed, maintained, and controlled by
the very same individuals who run the NRCC.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed after the newspaper Roll Call reported
this week that the Republican committee had given $500,000 to a
group, the US Family Network, that had ties to DeLay, the
Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups named in the complaint are Americans for
Economic Growth and the Republican Majority Issues Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Don Matoon, deputy chairman of the Republican committee, called
the assertions ``utterly baseless.''

ADVERTISING: RUSH TO CAPITALIZE ON INTERNET ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You usually don't want to stand in the way of
agencies rushing to complete deals before the end of the year. That
is even more true this month because the urge to capitalize on the
frenzy for interactive advertising, marketing and media is spurring
deal makers to finish up in, well, Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   That is being demonstrated by three agreements to make
investments in e-mail marketing services, interactive agencies and
software by two agency giants, Interpublic Group of Cos. in New
York and Cordiant Communications Group in London.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail marketing deal brings together E-Dialog in Lexington,
Mass., founded in 1996, with Interpublic, the world's No. 1 agency
company in billings at $37.7 billion, according to the trade
publication Advertising Age, and No. 2 in revenue at $4.3 billion.
E-Dialog, which specializes in digital direct marketing services
like sending commercialized e-mail messages _ some with e-commerce
capabilities _ to consumers and businesses, is forming a strategic
partnership with Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is to be announced formally Friday morning by
Philip H. Geier Jr., chairman and chief executive of Interpublic,
at a presentation at the 27th annual PaineWebber Media Conference
in midtown Manhattan. Interpublic will act as a venture capitalist,
making an unspecified investment in E-Dialog along with two venture
capital firms, Commonwealth Capital and One Liberty Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to pair up with agencies,'' said John
Rizzi, president and chief executive at E-Dialog, because ``it's a
way to differentiate us from other e-mail marketing providers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future,'' he added, ``is not just our relationship with
our clients,'' which include CDNow, Doubleday, Lycos, Major League
Baseball and the National Football League, ``but to add to our
business through agencies.'' Interpublic agencies include
Carmichael Lynch, Draft Worldwide, the Lowe Group and the
McCann-Erickson World Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put E-Dialog together with our agencies,'' said Gil
Fuchsberg, vice president for new media and technology at
Interpublic, ``when clients tell us: `My Web banner ads are not
working. What other ways are there to get response?'''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail marketing is booming despite complaints from some
computer users and privacy advocates who denounce the practice as
disseminating spam, or unwanted e-mail. To counter that, many
advertisers send e-mail ads only to consumers who agree to receive
cyberpitches, a process known as opt-in e-mail or permission-based
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permission is important,'' Rizzi agreed, ``but our focus is in
precision, sending mail from some company you have an affinity or
relationship with, so you're delighted to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Rizzi cited a campaign last summer for
Ticketmaster/CitySearch, a unit of USA Networks Inc., centered on
sending a series of three unsolicited e-mail messages to people who
bought tickets to Bruce Springsteen concerts in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first e-mail was to thank you for your order,'' Rizzi
said, ``the second provided directions to the arena and your seat,
and the third, sent the morning after the concert, included the
playlist from the night before _ with every song a link to buying
the CD on which the song appears, plus show merchandise for sale
like T-shirts and programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-seven percent of those who opened the mail clicked to
something,'' he added, ``and in the best scenarios, 20 percent of
them bought something.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal in the realm of interactive agencies also involves
Interpublic, which is bundling many _ but not all _ of its
interests in shops devoted to online advertising, design and
consulting services into a unit named Zentropy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Zentropy is starting with almost 500 employees at 11 offices in
five countries handling accounts with annual revenue estimated at
more than $50 million from clients like Coca-Cola, General Motors,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Lucent Technologies and Microsoft. The name
comes from Zentropy Inc., an interactive agency in Los Angeles and
New York in which Interpublic took a minority stake in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To form Zentropy Partners, Interpublic is now taking a majority
stake in Zentropy Inc. and folding in two other interactive
agencies it acquired last year. They are Digital Cafe in
Minneapolis and MDEO in Lyon, France, and Paris. That will make
Interpublic the owner of what Barry Linsky, senior vice president
for planning and business development at Interpublic, described as
``a substantial majority'' of Zentropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zentropy will be independent,'' he added, ``but closely
aligned with Interpublic.'' Zentropy will work with McCann-Erickson
in areas like international expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Zentropy resembles Communicade, a unit formed by
the Omnicom Group in New York to manage the minority and majority
stakes it owns in interactive agencies like Agency.com and
Razorfish. And trade publications have reported that Interpublic as
well as Omnicom may be considering initial public offerings of
Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an important difference: the interactive operations
of several Interpublic agencies are also becoming part of Zentropy.
By comparison, the interactive units of Omnicom agencies like the
DDB Worldwide Communications Group are not part of Communicade.
</P>
<P>
   The units joining Zentropy are Anderson &AMP; Lembke Interactive in
San Francisco; Hill, Holliday Interactive, part of Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston and New York; Shandwick Interactive
in London, Minneapolis and St. Louis, part of Shandwick
International; and Thunder House in Frankfurt, Germany, and New
York, part of McCann-Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   John Connors III, 32, senior vice president and managing
director at Hill, Holliday Interactive, will be chief executive at
Zentropy, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. Ryan Magnussen,
co-founder of Zentropy Inc., will be president at Zentropy.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of Zentropy was reported Thursday by The Wall
Street Journal. But in a description of the scheduled Interpublic
presentation in a booklet distributed on Monday by PaineWebber, the
list of speakers identified Connors by his Zentropy title rather
than by his title at Hill, Holliday Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Oops!
</P>
<P>
   Not all Interpublic interactive interests are being included in
Zentropy, Linsky said, because ``we're not dictating `One size fits
all' or saying everyone has to avail themselves of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the interactive unit of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners, a
division of the Lowe Group, will remain separate from Zentropy. The
unit, bearing the interim name Lowe Lintas Interactive, is being
formed by the merger of the digital operations of two Interpublic
agencies that themselves have already merged: Ammirati Puris Lintas
and Lowe &AMP; Partners Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe Lintas Interactive _ the result of the combination of Lowe
Interactive and APL Digital _ will be led by Dan Goodman, 26, as
managing director; he had been director of Lowe Interactive. Lowe
Lintas Interactive will have 43 employees in New York and San
Francisco working on accounts with billings for 2000 estimated at
$50 million from clients like Eddie Bauer, Heineken, Lego, Mapquest
and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   Also remaining separate from Zentropy is Icon Medialab
International in Stockholm, Sweden, in which Interpublic owns a 20
percent stake. Icon is the largest independent Internet services
and consulting company in Europe and agreed last month to acquire
Nicholson NY, an electronic business development company.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the deal involving Cordiant, that agency company,
which owns shops like Bates Worldwide, is acquiring Interactive
Edge in New York, which develops software for marketers like
Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Nabisco and Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Cordiant is paying a combination of cash and stock valued at
$6.1 million for Interactive Edge, whose software enables sales
forces to present data to retailers in ways intended to help
stimulate sales of name-brand packaged goods. The deal calls for an
additional payment of up to $19 million in stock considerations
based on the financial performance of Interactive Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Edge, which will become an autonomous unit of the
141 Worldwide division of Cordiant, has about 20 employees. Zel
Bianco, 44, will continue as chief executive.

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The streets of this grief-stricken city
became a winding stream of mourners Thursday morning as thousands
of firefighters led a three-mile procession to honor six of their
own, killed last week while battling a fire in an abandoned
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The sky was cloudless, but smoke still billowed from that
windowless building.
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton and a host of politicians eulogized
the firefighters at a service in the Worcester Centrum, an arena in
the heart of downtown, dozens of firefighters and search dogs
continued to sift through the rubble of the warehouse for the
bodies of four of the firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your men are ours,'' Clinton told those at the service. ``Our
whole country honors them and you. We grieve with you, and we will
stay with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A homeless couple, who the authorities believe may have
accidentally started the fire when they knocked over a candle, are
being held on $1 million bail; both have pleaded not guilty to
charges of involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In this blue-collar city, where nearly everyone seems to have
some connection to a firefighter, the tight fraternity of
firefighters was on full display. The streets, lined deep on both
sides with an estimated 25,000 spectators, were eerily quiet, the
silence broken only by the dirge of bagpipes and snares.
</P>
<P>
   Parents propped their children on their shoulders. A long row of
construction workers stood at the end of the procession route,
yellow hard hats tucked under their arms. The Boston Fire
Department led the procession, bearing flags of Ireland and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters came from as far as Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Fort
Wayne, Ind., and an Amtrak train full of firefighters arrived from
Connecticut early in the morning. Some came to march in their dress
uniforms, others to fill the memorial service in the Centrum, still
others who could not get in to watch the service on big-screen TVs
inside the pubs lining Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope by our collective presence we will speak louder than
words and say your tragedy is ours,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the six firefighters left five widows and 17
children.
</P>
<P>
   While struggling with their grief, many city residents expressed
compassion for the two squatters who fled from a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when cities nationwide have imposed new measures
against the homeless, there was little clamor here for punishment
of the homeless in general, or the accused couple in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a mistake,'' said Fred Stone, 43, a telemarketer who
had come to watch the firefighters dig through the rubble late
Wednesday night. ``They're not responsible for the deaths of six
firefighters. You have to put yourself in a homeless person's body.
You're going to find a place to go and you're going to build a
fire. It's the nature of people to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few here seemed to know the pair. Thomas S. Levesque, 37,
rolled a shopping cart every day, foraging for cans. His
girlfriend, Julie S. Barnes, 19, is three months pregnant,
according to her lawyer. Both volunteered at a soup kitchen called
the Mustard Seed, and Levesque tried repeatedly to find jobs,
recalled another volunteer, Michele Sampson. On Thursday Ms.
Sampson, who is also homeless, said she planned to write to the
couple in jail and offer to care for the baby they are expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester, once a hub of textile plants and wiremaking
factories, has been struggling to reinvent itself. Its population
has declined steadily in the last three decades to about 166,000
today. Its gleaming downtown has a new outlet mall and the Centrum
arena. The old railroad station, with its elaborate white domes,
has been renovated. But just on the edge of downtown is the swath
of old warehouses and narrow streets lined with auto repair shops
and butcher shops _ still busy with daytime traffic but also
natural resting place for the homeless at night.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John A. Coonan, the pastor of St. John's Church, a
stone's throw from the abandoned warehouse, says pointedly that
only after nearby Union Station, a once dilapidated train station
where dozens of homeless slept every night, closed for renovations
did buildings like the warehouse where the firefighters died,
Worcester Cold Storage, become regular dormitories for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 1,000 shelter beds in the city have all been
occupied since summer. ``I believe to the core of my being that we
are all responsible for that fire,'' said Coonan. ``Worcester has
not seriously taken on the challenge of homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was well known that homeless people squatted in the Worcester
Cold Storage building. That is why firefighters raced in on Friday
night, thinking someone might be trapped inside. No one was. The
homeless couple fled the building and failed to report the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some had little sympathy for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear no excuses,'' fumed Dian Germain, 40, a
waitress who stood in front of the Central Fire Station Thursday
morning for the procession. ``That's all they had to do _ say there
was nobody in the building.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, firefighters have repeatedly said in recent days that
their job was not to pass judgment against the people who are
accused, but to find the bodies of all those who perished. In the
last few days, as food and drink has poured into local fire
stations, some of it has been passed on to homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, firefighters have retrieved only the bodies of Timothy
Jackson, 51, and James Lyons, 34. Still missing are Paul
Brotherton, 41, Jeremiah Lucey, 38, Joseph McGuirk, 38, and Thomas
Spencer, 42.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, a visibly exhausted deputy chief of the
Worcester Fire Department, Gerry Dio, said the search had yielded
no new clues. Fire officials said they had combed through about 50
to 60 percent of the five-story brick building, a thickly insulated
catacomb where cattle carcasses and hamburger patties were stored.
They vowed to find the other four bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like Day One because everyone's not out,'' said Jim
Sweeney, a firefighter from nearby Auburn, who has helped with the
search since Friday. ``We're trying to get closure. Everyone's got
to come home.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For them, a fire truck parked near the Cold Storage building has
been transformed into a shrine, literally shrouded with bouquets of
mums and carnations, poems and letters. All day and all night, it
has drawn visitors and it has reduced burly men to tears. There is
a collage with painted hearts and sad faces, a wreath from the
Worcester AIDS project and a framed Fire Wife's Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is this deeply personal letter from a
sixth-grader named Laurencia. She writes of a father she has not
seen since she was 5. ``At least I do know he is alive, she writes.
``But still I feel like I have lost my father too just like those
15 children.''

EDITORIAL: REJECTING `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton was exactly right when she told a gay
audience at a fund-raiser in New York City this week that
homosexuals ought to be able to serve openly in the U.S. military.
That is the position her husband held when he campaigned for
president, promising to issue an executive order to end the
Department of Defense's ban on homosexuals in the armed forces. But
in 1993 the new president allowed opposition in Congress and the
Pentagon to drive him to an ill-conceived compromise, the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks on Tuesday, the first lady said her husband's
policy had been a failure, and that is an understatement. ``Don't
ask, don't tell'' has led to increased harassment of homosexuals
and doubling in the number of discharges of gay service members. It
has also turned barracks life into a grotesque trap for many gay
men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing brings that fact into harsher focus than the murder of
Army Pfc. Barry Winchell of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort
Campbell, Ky., in July. For weeks, while his company sergeant
looked on and did nothing, Winchell endured daily sexual taunts and
harassment from his barracks mates. When he finally beat his chief
tormentor in a fistfight, that man, Pvt. Calvin Glover, retaliated
by beating him to death with a baseball bat two nights later as he
slept in his bunk.
</P>
<P>
   As in other cases when Mrs. Clinton has criticized her husband's
policies, the politics here are plain. Her prospective opponent in
the 2000 Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has been critical of
the Pentagon policy. To continue to support the failed policy would
have hampered her ability to compete with Giuliani for New York
City's influential gay voters. In an odd campaign twist, Mrs.
Clinton may have subsequently damaged her standing with those same
voters by saying Thursday that she would march in the St. Patrick's
Day Parade. That event is shunned by many Democratic politicians
because the parade's organizers exclude the Irish Gay and Lesbian
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the parade remark turns into a serious gaffe, the
clarity of Mrs. Clinton's new position on the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy is encouraging. So was the verdict of the martial
jury at Fort Campbell, which on Wednesday found Glover guilty of
premeditated murder.

NEW YORK REGION PAYS U.S. MORE THAN IT GETS, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York, New Jersey and Connecticut get
substantially less money from the federal government each year than
their residents pay in federal taxes, a study released Thursday
shows.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, according to the study, Washington ships
considerably more money to a group of states in the South than it
receives from them in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to rethink our system of federalism,'' said Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has sponsored the study every
year since he entered Congress in 1977. He offered no concrete view
of what a new system should look like.
</P>
<P>
   The state-by-state analysis, conducted by professors at Harvard,
covered tax payments and receipts of federal money in the fiscal
year that ended on Sept. 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the disparity is that residents of states
with high per capita income pay much more on average in federal
income taxes than do those of states where the income is lower.
Connecticut has the highest per capita income in the country. New
Jersey is second and New York is 13th.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation, federal money is distributed
more evenly among the states, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
   The authors calculated that New Yorkers on average paid $5,676
in federal taxes in the 1998 fiscal year. The state received $4,840
per person in federal money for everything from Social Security
checks to highway construction. The difference, $836, was called
the balance of payments deficit, and it made New York the 13th
worst-off state. Connecticut had the highest balance of payments
deficit, and New Jersey was second.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has no plan for how to change the situation.
``Hawaii,'' he said, ``has to have more naval bases than South
Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the state-by-state disparities, which have changed
little over the years, give the senator ammunition for political
debates. This year, the senator and his allies used the data
successfully to fight off legislation that would have put a cap on
how much any state could receive in transit assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in spending among the states is also a result in
part of the ability over the years of Southern lawmakers to attain
positions of influence on committees with control over federal
projects. New Yorkers, by contrast, have tended to favor committees
like judiciary and international relations with little money to
distribute.

   NEW YORK _ Robert Bingham's wedding six months ago, like his

well-chronicled, contentious Southern newspaper family married
Vanessa Scharven Chase at a historic farmhouse in Princeton, N.J.,
the understated fragrance of taste and privilege prevailed.
</P>

   Then came the reception. ``Everyone ambled over to the barn, and

spontaneous rock show,'' said Henry P. Davis, 34, who was the best
man for his friend from boarding school. The rock band Pavement
played, with other musicians joining in. Bingham and Dean Wareham,
from the band Luna, sang ``Sweet Child o' Mine'' to the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Wareham sang that Guns 'n' Roses song, alone, at
Bingham's memorial service on Park Avenue. A promising fiction
writer whose first novel is scheduled for publication by Doubleday
Broadway in May, he died Nov. 28 in his loft in TriBeCa, after what
one law enforcement official said apparently was a heroin overdose.
He was 33.
</P>
<P>
   From the accounts of friends and partners in his artistic
pursuits, Bingham lived hard, wrote hard, and was admired for
sharing the benefits of his birthright with the city's artistic and
literary community and with other philanthropic projects around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   His life was full of adventures that almost begged to be written
about: spilling secrets about family campaign contributions during
a martini-drinking contest, distributing $100 bills after a
Kentucky Derby tip paid off, sleeping from Sunday night until
Tuesday after reporting about the wedding of a Khmer Rouge
general's daughter in the riskier reaches of Cambodia. His
interests ranged from archaeology to tennis (played fiercely) to
collecting Zippo lighters.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath, there was a sadness fueling his creativity: the death
of his father when the writer was 4 months old, the loss of the
chance to lead the family business, a battle with alcohol and
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always such a struggle for Robbie,'' Thomas Beller,
co-editor of Open City, a literary magazine Bingham published, said
at the memorial service at Calvary Episcopal Church. ``But it was
exhilarating to be around that struggle. It was perplexing, but it
was also somehow inspiring, because I always felt that part of what
he was wrestling with was the truth, the truth about people and
society and himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bingham lived just a few blocks from John F. Kennedy Jr.,
and some cannot help but see similarities between their families.
Alex S. Jones, who chronicled the Bingham family's epic
disagreements and eventual decision to sell their newspapers, The
Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, called the family the
Kennedys of Kentucky, in that they were liberal, glamorous,
powerful and public spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham continued that tradition and apparently redirected his
disappointment in the papers' sale into a more artistic,
philanthropic career. Besides backing the literary magazine, he
published a book of David Berman, a poet whose work he admired, and
was known for supporting innovative performances, Web sites and
documentary films.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, he wrote stories with vivid descriptions of the
lives of privileged, dissolute people his age. Comparisons were
made to F. Scott Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of Tom and Daisy Buchanan's offspring, but with more
than two wits to rub together,'' said Geoffrey Wolff, a fiction
writer, about ``Pure Slaughter Value,'' Bingham's 1997 collection
of short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham was the son of Worth Bingham, assistant publisher of the
family papers, who died at 34, hit in the head by the surfboard he
was carrying in a convertible, during a drive with his family.
Robert Bingham's mother, Joan Bingham, is executive editor of
Grove/Atlantic Press, the New York publishing house. He grew up in
the Dakota apartment building in Manhattan, attended Dalton and St.
Bernard's.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as an intern at The Courier-Journal while in high
school, and is remembered there for his inquisitiveness and humor,
and for getting arrested for urinating on the bushes in front of
the police station. He headed to boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, who taught Bingham in a writing class at Brown
University, remembered one tender autobiographical essay from
Bingham's senior year. ``He wrote about his family with wide-open
candor, but without anger or contempt,'' he said. ``He was, by God,
courageous, recklessly courageous on the page.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was known for taking other kinds of risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie always went one step closer to the edge,'' his sister,
Clara, said at the memorial. ``He hated the false, the easy, the
conventional. Robbie was fearless of the scary things in life, but
in his deepest heart he was vulnerable and afraid. He was tormented
by our father's death and by his own struggle with addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after brief stints at The New York Post and
The Tennesseean, he traveled frequently to Cambodia, where he
worked for The Cambodia Daily as the newspaper was setting up shop
in the attic of a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 26, Bingham's first piece of short fiction was
published in The New Yorker. In it the narrator, a man in his 20s
who has yet to discover what to do with his life, attends a funeral
for his young first cousin, who had apparently died of a drug
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, had not died yet, and I felt good and healthy
driving down a safe street on a beautiful day in the shelter of
suburban Far Hills,'' he wrote. After the wake, the narrator goes
off in the woods with a bottle of Jack Daniels, some pot, and his
cousin's sister. They drink. They smoke. They kiss. Everyone goes
home.
</P>
<P>
   His collection of stories skirt between moral vigilance and
self-destruction. In them, rich Hamptonites try to seduce their
maid, a honeymooning couple decides to kill an obnoxious skier, and
people dress in the clothes of their dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the collection's publication, New York magazine published
a profile of Bingham, saying, ``word for word he may be New York's
finest writer about New York.'' In it, he told the interviewer: ``I
think everyone has to manage their death drive, their will to
destroy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bingham threw late-running parties at his loft,
where people had to buy a copy of the magazine for admission.
``They were always incredibly fun, and incredibly populated,'' said
Elizabeth Schmidt, senior editor with Open City magazine. ``He was
a draw for so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   In between trips to Cambodia and beyond, he wrote his novel,
even though working on it felt like ``standing at the starting line
of a marathon, smoking,'' he wrote to one friend.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Vanessa Chase, found Bingham dead on the floor of
their bathroom the Sunday after Thanksgiving. A couple of empty
glassine envelopes were found next to him, the police said. The
medical examiner has yet to rule on the exact cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Those who worked with Bingham professionally said that anyone
with a serious drug problem could not have written, revised or
edited as well and intensively as he did.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they spoke of an open-hearted and charismatic man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went a very wrong way, and he knew he was in trouble, you
know, recently,'' said Jesdale, Bingham's high school coach, who
had kept in contact with him. ``You know Rob, for me, will always
be this wonderful kid who had this incredible burn to be excellent,
and was.''

 `LOST SQUADRON' STORY A SNOW JOB  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a frigid tale fit for a nippy day across Arizona. It's
about the ``Lost Squadron,'' a group of eight American planes lost
in a storm over Greenland during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As told by Robert Balling, an Arizona State University climate
expert, the story would seem to debunk claims of global warming and
melting ice in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   I'd describe it as something else: a good snow job.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, 1942, U.S. pilots were flying two B-17 Flying
Fortresses and six P-38 Lightnings from Greenland to England when
bad weather forced them to ditch the planes on Greenland's icecap.
All 25 crewmen survived, but the planes were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several expeditions searched for the aircraft,
estimating they would be found below about 40 feet of snow and ice.
But when they were finally located with the help of subsurface
radar in 1988, the planes were 268 feet below the surface. With the
help of hot water cannons, one of the P-38s, dubbed ``Glacier
Girl,'' was brought up piece by piece in 1992 and is being
restored.
</P>
<P>
   If reports of global warming and shrinking ice sheets are true,
Balling asks in a Web site article, why were the planes buried so
deeply?
</P>
<P>
   ``If those planes were sentient, they would find it hard to
believe all these apocalyptic stories about melting icecaps,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to cite temperature records for that area of
Greenland that show a cooling of 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit during the
50 years before the P-38 was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much of Balling's work, this story was not published in a
peer-reviewed journal, and for good reason. As he concedes, a large
inland accumulation of ice and snow over a half-century doesn't
prove anything about the overall state of Greenland's ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, global warming theory predicts more precipitation as
temperatures rise, and recent studies have found significant
melting in the Great White North. The evidence includes:
</P>
<P>
   A report by Norwegian researchers in the journal Science using
satellite data that show Arctic ice diminished 14 percent in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A study relying on sonar data from nuclear submarines that found
the floating ice cover in the Arctic Ocean was 40 percent thinner
than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the current issue of Science that examined five
different sets of data and concluded that sea ice in the Northern
Hemisphere declined 7 percent in the past 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   A finding by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
that several edges of Greenland's ice sheet have lost 3 to 6 feet
in thickness per year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's best-known global warming critics, Balling
has published 103 peer-reviewed articles, including dozens on
greenhouse gases and warming. The ``Lost Squadron'' story, however,
was written for the Greening Earth Society, a creation of the
Western Fuels Association. Both organizations dispute that fossil
fuels have harmed the global environment.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of his work has been funded by fossil-fuel groups,
Balling has been called a rent-a-scientist who's in bed with the
industry. He says none of his work has been compromised and notes
that his largest current grant, $500,000, came from the National
Science Foundation. He disagrees that government-funded research is
more pure than industry-funded research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it all goes through peer-review, and anything
industry-funded is likely to be held to a higher standard,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Balling correctly warns that people shouldn't leap to
conclusions based on any single study. He points out that ice
masses are constantly thinning and thickening, and the net change
isn't easy to measure. Any warming, he contends, could be the
result of increased solar output just as likely as human activity.
</P>
<P>
   We should be skeptical of ``bold, simplistic pronouncements
about global warming,'' Balling says, and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   We should be no less skeptical of glib anecdotes from Greenland
more likely to mislead than inform. &QL;

GIZMOS GALORE GIVE `GADGET' A CARTOON FLAVOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `INSPECTOR GADGET'
</P>
<P>
   Disney hasn't just been remaking its '60s hits (``The Parent
Trap,'' ``That Darn Cat,'' ``101 Dalmatians''). It's also been
cobbling them for re-inventions.
</P>
<P>
   The gizmos and guffaws of its ``Merlin Jones'' movies are what
propel ``Inspector Gadget'' _ along with '80s cartoons of the same
name, which in turn took the premise of the '70s TV show ``The Six
Million Dollar Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Broderick plays the title character, a cop wannabe who's
injured in an explosion. To repair his body, he's fitted with a
wild array of crime-fighting gadgets, enabling him to fly, stretch
his arms and spew streams of icky toothpaste as a public protector.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is a bigger barrage of computer effects than were in
evidence in ``The Haunting.'' ``Gadget'' is as close to a
live-action cartoon as it gets _ even to the point of having
animated stars swirl around a guy who's knocked on the noggin.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the performances are broad, the dialogue is corny
(``Oh, for crying out loud!''), and the humor hinges on slapstick
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   While this fanciful fun is kid-geared at the expense of adults,
Gadget also is afflicted with a taint of today's pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, kids are mature and sophisticated, while adults
behave like kids _ or do you truly think the stars of ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``Friends'' are acting their ages?
</P>
<P>
   Heck, even the bickering barristers of ``The Practice'' would
rather engage in infantile shouting matches (often sounding like
``Did not!'' ``Did, too!'') than exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Gadget,'' its only real kid is Michelle Trachtenberg
(``Harriet the Spy'') as Broderick's sensible niece.
</P>
<P>
   His love interest and the gadgets' inventor is Joely Fisher, who
looks uncannily like Broderick's real-life wife, Sarah Jessica
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick is earnest, warm and bland as our hero. He's far more
fun as Gadget's evil clone, a wild man with capped teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But Rupert Everett is wasted as the dapper villain, merely aping
his looniness in ``Dunston Checks In'' (a better kid flick).
</P>
<P>
   Here, he's so hammy you expect to hear oinks, and he also adopts
the film's witless childishness. If anything, Everett is the
biggest kid of all.
</P>
<P>
   At least the film has clever opening credits _ and some
surprises for those who stick around for the end credits. At only
78 minutes, even an adult's attention span should allow that.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 1 1/2 stars.

</P>
<P>
   Rupert Everett fares a bit better in this latest adaptation of
Shakespeare's romantic comedy _ a bit, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   He's among an outstanding cast, along with Kevin Kline, Michelle
Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci and David Strathairn. (As for Calista
Flockhart, she's out of her league.)
</P>
<P>
   But for all its visual splendors (with early-1900s Italy the
setting) and its sprinkling of fairy dust, this tale is choppy and
ponderous, with an ensemble of stars who don't really gel.

<P>
   Disney and Pixar made the right call with ``Toy Story 2.''
Unlike animated sequels to ``The Lion King'' and ``Pocahontas,'' it
went straight to theaters _ not video _ where it's setting
box-office records.
</P>
<P>
   But the franchise's picture still looks bright on video, where
the original ``Toy Story'' has sold 22 million copies on tape.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity is that it's still not on DVD, unlike Pixar's ``A
Bug's Life,'' which followed ``Toy Story'' in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually (''Toy Story``) will be on DVD,'' said director
John Lasseter, who also helmed the sequel and ``A Bug's Life.''
``But we're really adamant about the digital transfer being just
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems like they could have been ``really adamant'' about ``Toy
Story'' for DVD before ``A Bug's Life.'' At any rate, Lasseter says
Pixar is busy ``restoring'' it for a digital transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story'' does exist on the fading laserdisc format, where
it has what Lasseter calls ``a wonderful deluxe edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' also just got such an edition on DVD, adding
many more extras than its first DVD release. The latter costs
around $24, with the deluxe edition around $35.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Toy Story 2,'' it could reach tape, at least, as early
as April. ``A Bug's Life'' appeared on tape and DVD last April,
after opening in theaters the previous Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In other Disney news, ``The Jungle Book'' and ``The Little
Mermaid'' arrive on DVD for a suggested $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   (Does anyone pay such a price? You can find them online for
under $24.)

</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' drops to $22.99 this week on VHS and
gains a deluxe DVD edition for $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   Also on disc are two vintage horror flicks from Elite: 1972's
``Tower of Evil'' and 1973's ``Horror Hospital,'' both $24.95. The
latter has Michael Gough, now in ``Sleepy Hollow.''

BORIS YELTSIN'S OUTBURST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is known for his occasional
bombast, some of it playful, some angry, some merely erratic. But
when the man who commands the largest nuclear stockpile in the
world rattles that arsenal after he gives his vintage bear hug to
President Jiang Zemin of China, the scene is, at best, unsettling.
There is reason for reassurance, however, in the calm response from
the Clinton administration and the speedy effort by Russia's prime
minister, Vladimir Putin, to emphasize the stability of overall
relations between the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Recently ill with pneumonia and increasingly irritated at
Western criticism of his country's war in Chechnya, Yeltsin accused
President Clinton Thursday of forgetting that ``Russia is a great
power that possesses a full nuclear arsenal.'' The 68-year-old
Russian leader also said during his visit to Beijing that he wanted
Clinton to know that ``he alone cannot dictate how the world should
live, work and play. It is we who will dictate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has reverted to adversarial rhetoric in the past, and
American officials have learned to count on the transience of these
outbursts. He was irritated in this case by the Clinton
administration's warnings that Russia's military campaign in
Chechnya would not achieve the desired result. Clinton tried to
discount his Russian counterpart's comments by saying, ``We can't
get too serious about that.'' Meanwhile, Putin assured the
administration that Russian-U.S. relations were not as strained as
Yeltsin had made them out to be, despite the two nations'
differences on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has hardly been strident in his criticism of Russia's
brutal Chechen policy. He has not called for sanctions or an end to
aid for Moscow, as have several American presidential candidates.
But the president has repeatedly said that Russia's policy _
pursuing terrorists by leveling Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and
killing innocent civilians _ is inhumane. He also argues that the
war is self-defeating, both militarily and ultimately for Russia's
longer-range goals of being considered by the world as a more
enlightened nation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia should absorb that analysis and move toward a political
settlement in Chechnya. Meanwhile, despite Yeltsin's outburst, the
signals from the White House and Putin underscored an important
point about the larger framework of Russian-American relations.
Both countries have a strong interest in seeing continued progress
on combating nuclear proliferation and safeguarding the transition
to democracy represented by Russia's parliamentary election on Dec.

 `LOST SQUADRON' STORY A SNOW JOB  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a frigid tale fit for a nippy day across Arizona. It's
about the ``Lost Squadron,'' a group of eight American planes lost
in a storm over Greenland during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As told by Robert Balling, an Arizona State University climate
expert, the story would seem to debunk claims of global warming and
melting ice in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   I'd describe it as something else: a good snow job.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, 1942, U.S. pilots were flying two B-17 Flying
Fortresses and six P-38 Lightnings from Greenland to England when
bad weather forced them to ditch the planes on Greenland's icecap.
All 25 crewmen survived, but the planes were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several expeditions searched for the aircraft,
estimating they would be found below about 40 feet of snow and ice.
But when they were finally located with the help of subsurface
radar in 1988, the planes were 268 feet below the surface. With the
help of hot water cannons, one of the P-38s, dubbed ``Glacier
Girl,'' was brought up piece by piece in 1992 and is being
restored.
</P>
<P>
   If reports of global warming and shrinking ice sheets are true,
Balling asks in a Web site article, why were the planes buried so
deeply?
</P>
<P>
   ``If those planes were sentient, they would find it hard to
believe all these apocalyptic stories about melting icecaps,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to cite temperature records for that area of
Greenland that show a cooling of 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit during the
50 years before the P-38 was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much of Balling's work, this story was not published in a
peer-reviewed journal, and for good reason. As he concedes, a large
inland accumulation of ice and snow over a half-century doesn't
prove anything about the overall state of Greenland's ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, global warming theory predicts more precipitation as
temperatures rise, and recent studies have found significant
melting in the Great White North. The evidence includes:
</P>
<P>
   A report by Norwegian researchers in the journal Science using
satellite data that show Arctic ice diminished 14 percent in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A study relying on sonar data from nuclear submarines that found
the floating ice cover in the Arctic Ocean was 40 percent thinner
than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the current issue of Science that examined five
different sets of data and concluded that sea ice in the Northern
Hemisphere declined 7 percent in the past 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   A finding by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
that several edges of Greenland's ice sheet have lost 3 to 6 feet
in thickness per year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's best-known global warming critics, Balling
has published 103 peer-reviewed articles, including dozens on
greenhouse gases and warming. The ``Lost Squadron'' story, however,
was written for the Greening Earth Society, a creation of the
Western Fuels Association. Both organizations dispute that fossil
fuels have harmed the global environment.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of his work has been funded by fossil-fuel groups,
Balling has been called a rent-a-scientist who's in bed with the
industry. He says none of his work has been compromised and notes
that his largest current grant, $500,000, came from the National
Science Foundation. He disagrees that government-funded research is
more pure than industry-funded research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it all goes through peer-review, and anything
industry-funded is likely to be held to a higher standard,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Balling correctly warns that people shouldn't leap to
conclusions based on any single study. He points out that ice
masses are constantly thinning and thickening, and the net change
isn't easy to measure. Any warming, he contends, could be the
result of increased solar output just as likely as human activity.
</P>
<P>
   We should be skeptical of ``bold, simplistic pronouncements
about global warming,'' Balling says, and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   We should be no less skeptical of glib anecdotes from Greenland
more likely to mislead than inform. &QL;

TER'S LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 WITNESSES PLEAD FOR FALA (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By JERRY KAMMER 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  Phoenix - Former co-workers, rela
tives and friends implored a judge Thursday not to end Scott
Falater's life, which they said was exemplary until that bizarre
night in 1997 when he stabbed his wife to death.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was the most compassionate, caring boss that I've ever
had,'' said Wyvaughna Mullins, a shipping clerk at Motorola, where
Falater was an electronics engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the calm, level-headed one,'' said Michael
Vines, who befriended Scott and Yarmila Falater 20 years ago when
the couple were living in Illinois. ``He just had the greatest
heart of any man, I think, I have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins and Vines were two of 11 witnesses who testified on the
first day of a sentencing hearing for Falater, who was convicted in
June of first-degree murder. The 44-year-old father of two faces
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member jury rejected the defense claim that he was sleep
walking when he stabbed Yarmila dozens of times, dragged her into
the backyard pool and held her head underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his fate is in the hands of Judge Ronald Reinstein, who is
weighing the circumstances of the crime before deciding from three
options: the death penalty, life with no chance for parole, or life
with the possibility of parole after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Juan Martinez is attempt ing to convince Reinstein
that the murder meets the state death penalty standard because it
was ``especially heinous, cruel or depraved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense attorneys Mi chael Kimerer and Lori Voepel
argue that the ``mitigating circumstances'' in Falater's life
should persuade Reinstein to impose the least severe sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez launched the hearing by guiding a county medical
examiner through a graphic description of the 44 stab wounds that
punctured Yarmila Falater's upper body with a hunting knife.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was so fierce that two of the wounds penetrated to
the hilt of the 5-inch blade, according to the testimony of Dr. Ann
Bucholtz.
</P>
<P>
   Bucholtz, spoke in calm, clinical terms, holding up autopsy
photos and explaining that the cause of death was ``multiple stab
wounds with asphyxiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez attempted to establish the attack's cruelty by arguing
that Falater left his wife to die while he returned to the house,
washed the blood from his hands and arms and stashed his crimsoned
clothes in the wheel well of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   After Bucholtz's testimony, defense attorneys began questioning
their 20 witnesses. The testimonials about Falater's character will
resume Mon day.
</P>
<P>
   All expressed bewilderment about the killing and disbelief that
Falater acted consciously that night, after having what his two
teenage children said at trial was a calm dinner at home. All urged
the judge to spare the life of a man whose son and daughter have
already lost their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and Megan adore this man, and they need him desper
ately,'' said Cheri Allen, who knows the family through Mormon
Church activities. She described Falater as ``a kind, devoted,
loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez challenged all the defense witnesses. Some had only a
superfi cial acquaintanceship with the Fala ters, he said, and none
could truly understand what happened inside the Falater home.
</P>
<P>
   He said Falater was responsible for the suffering of Megan and
Michael, who were described by Falater's mother as ``devastated''
in the kill ing's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Thursday that the placid surface of the Falater
home concealed tensions and turmoil seething beneath.
</P>
<P>
   He described Yarmila as a strong-willed, independent woman who
re sented a church to which her hus band was devoted. He suggested
that Yarmila was weighing a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense witnesses said they saw no indication of
domestic stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was crazy about her,'' Allen said.

WILLIAM JACKSON DIES AT 80; LAWYER WITH WIDE CLIENTELE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Eldred Jackson, a New York lawyer with an international
clientele that included Nelson Rockefeller, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, the king of Morocco and Baron Hans Heinrich
Thyssen-Bornemisza, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan. He was 80 and also had a home in Cold Spring
Harbor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was throat cancer, a family spokesman said. He said
Jackson had continued to go to his office until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson came to the law as a personal assistant to his father,
Robert H. Jackson, an associate justice of the Supreme Court
appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Jackson, a native of Jamestown, N.Y., was first in
his class at St. Albans School in Washington and graduated Phi Beta
Kappa in 1941 from Yale University, where he was vice chairman of
The Yale Daily News. He was an editor of the Harvard Law Review and
got his LL.B there in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   He then was a lieutenant in the Navy until 1946. William Jackson
followed Robert Jackson to Germany when his father, on a leave of
absence, was America's chief counsel for the prosecution at the
Nuremberg trial of major Nazi war criminals. As a staff member,
private secretary and law clerk, William Jackson took part in the
interrogation of Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer. He
was co-editor of the eight volumes of trial evidence printed by the
American government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, he joined the Wall Street law firm of Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley &AMP; McCloy, specializing in civil litigation, including
arbitration, as well as antitrust actions and international legal
disputes. He became a partner in 1954 and was a consulting partner
at his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was the personal lawyer for Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New
York in 1974, when President Gerald Ford picked Rockefeller as his
vice president after the Watergate scandal; he counseled
Rockefeller at his confirmation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson represented Mrs. Onassis in her negotiations with the
Onassis estate after the Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle, her
second husband, died in 1975. He also advised Baron
Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Swiss industrialist, in the intricate
international bargaining before he moved his fabled art collection
into its own museum, a stone's throw from the Prado Museum in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Jackson won two landmark Supreme Court cases for
the New York Stock Exchange that established guidelines for class
action cases in the securities industry. He was a past vice
chairman of the International Court of Arbitration in the
International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is survived by his wife of 55 years, Nancy Dabney
Roosevelt Jackson, a granddaughter of President Theodore Roosevelt;
five daughters, Miranda Hook of Fairfield, Conn., Melissa Morgan of
Cold Spring Harbor and Melanie Jackson, Melinda Kessler and Marina
Jackson, all of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The smorgasbord begins today as the winter
meetings commence in Anaheim, Calif., but the Los Angeles Dodgers
find themselves in a tight, unforgiving spot.
</P>
<P>
   They go in with three objectives: Reduce payroll by about $10
million, strengthen the bullpen and bolster the bench.
</P>
<P>
   How the Dodgers perform in 2000 will depend heavily on what
takes place in Anaheim, but the club goes into the ultra-important
meetings with an enormous X-factor that threatens to throw their
plans off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers need an answer on the Adrian Beltre saga before they
can move forward, but baseball said it won't announce one until
late next week. If Beltre is declared a free agent and baseball
forbids the Dodgers to re-sign him, the club may have to trade for
a third baseman or pay $12 to $15 million for free agent Todd
Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   However, as general manager Kevin Malone drives down I-5 today
to engage in face-to-face trade talks and free-agent negotiations,
he has five days to face five crucial things:
</P>
<P>
   __Trade Ismael Valdes. Plenty of clubs want the 26-year-old
pitcher, so Malone will have the opportunity. And moving Valdes
would chop approximately $6 million of payroll from the Dodgers'
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers insiders echo the sentiment of pitching coach Claude
Osteen, who late in the season questioned Valdes' toughness. The
Dodgers are confident either Mike Judd, Eric Gagne or Jeff Williams
can take over the fifth spot.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has shown enormous interest lately, but any deal
involving Valdes has two prongs. The Rockies must also be willing
to take on the burden of either second baseman Eric Young's
contract (two more years, $9 million) or Jose Vizcaino ($3.5
million salary next season). Sources said the Rockies weren't
willing to take on Vizcaino as well.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, Texas, Detroit, Colorado, St. Louis and Boston could
all make a run at Valdes, who will be a free agent after the 2000
season. That makes it more difficult to trade for top-notch
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   __Trade Young. If for no other reason, how can a club ask him to
return, play second base and lead off when much of their offseason
energy is spent on moving him?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest deterrent is his contract, which guarantees the
32-year-old $4.5 million in each of his next two seasons. Colorado
also showed interest in reacquiring Young, but sources in Denver
said the Rockies weren't willing to make such a financial
commitment to him. Colorado's signing of Tom Goodwin all but dashed
that chance.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Atlanta general manager John Schuerholz spoke last
month at the general managers' meetings, presumably about a
Young-for-Bret Boone deal. Even though the Braves need a leadoff
hitter, an Atlanta source said the Braves are weary because of
Young's limited range and trouble turning the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry sources said Young most likely would end up in
St. Louis in a deal for a minor-league pitcher. A past deal was
nixed after the clubs couldn't agree on how much of Young's
contract the Dodgers would pay.
</P>
<P>
   __Find a third baseman. The predominant thought throughout
baseball is the Dodgers will loose Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they could do is negotiate a new contract with him
now. In turn, Beltre could drop his request to be a free agent, and
though baseball could fine and discipline the Dodgers, Beltre may
stay.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball voided a new contract, Beltre's agent, Scott Boras,
could file a grievance to keep his client with the Dodgers. As it
is, Boras is expected to file a grievance if Beltre is not declared
a free agent. The players' association may also file a grievance
because baseball, which has known about the case more than a month,
is taking so long to announce a decision.
</P>
<P>
   A source said the players' grievance could happen today.
</P>
<P>
   __Strengthen the bench. Can't be done until the Dodgers reduce
payroll. Club and baseball sources said Malone can't sign any free
agents, regardless of magnitude or cost, until payroll is reduced
via trades.
</P>
<P>
   The two most likely candidates _ utility infielders Terry
Shumpert and Kurt Abbott _ could sign elsewhere soon. Shumpert is
expected to re-sign with the Rockies and Abbott is being courted by
the Mets. Malone spoke with Shumpert's representatives about the
parameters of a deal, but one wasn't offered.
</P>
<P>
   __Strengthen the bullpen. There aren't a lot of alternatives
here. Though Baltimore's attempt to re-sign left-handed power
pitcher Arthur Rhodes stalled, a four-year contract for $10-to-$14
million is likely too rich a commitment given the Dodgers' lack of
flexability. &UR;

VICTOR PERLO, 87, MARXIST ECONOMIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Perlo, a Marxist economist whose career was damaged by
accusations during the Red scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s
that he spied for the Soviet Union in Washington during World War
II, died Dec. 1 at his home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Perlo had difficulty finding work after his loyalty was first
challenged in 1947 and then in hearings before the House
Un-American Activities Committee in 1948 and the Senate Committee
on Internal Security in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But he later developed a business as an economic consultant and
university lecturer and wrote 13 books. He was known for his
analysis of the political economy of U.S. capitalism, comparative
economic systems and what he called the economics of racism in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In one job after the initial accusations, Perlo worked on the
campaign of Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party's presidential
candidate in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s until his death, Perlo, who had a master's degree
in mathematics from Columbia University, served as the chief
economist of the Communist Party in the United States. He was also
a board member of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Perlo, who worked as an economist in government agencies during
the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, denied at the Washington
hearings that he had spied for the Soviet Union. But like many who
were questioned then by congressional committees, he invoked the
Fifth Amendment and refused to provide some answers.
</P>
<P>
   During one hearing in which he sparred with Senator William
Jenner, R-Ind., who led the Internal Security Committee, Perlo said
he did not want to discuss his reasons for invoking his
constitutional privilege. But his wife Ellen said last week that
her husband had not wanted to begin a line of response that might
lead to his being required to testify against others.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the hearings, Perlo said in a statement that
``the dragging of my name through the mud is part of a big Roman
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlo discovered he had a security problem in 1947 when he was
denied a passport he needed to become treasurer of the
Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees in Europe. He had resigned
a post at the Treasury Department and suddenly found himself
unemployed. The next year, he was called before the House
Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of a 1945 memorandum
from a federal agency in which a woman who said she had been a
courier between Communist espionage groups named Perlo as the head
of one of the groups.
</P>
<P>
   Perlo published his first book, ``American Imperialism,'' in
1951; his most recent, ``Economics of Racism II'' (International
Publishers), came three years ago. He taught at the New School and
at the College of New Rochelle and lectured at Harvard and other
universities.
</P>

MANDELAS CHALLENGE THE NEXT GENERATION

   SEATTLE _ Robed in black university gowns and topped with mortar
boards, Nelson Mandela and Graca Machel Thursday answered to the
next generation.
</P>
<P>
   In a convocation held at Seattle University, high school and
college students from around the region asked Mandela tough
questions about his support of Libya and Iran, his opinion of the
World Trade organization and his endurance through 27 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, the former president of South Africa, and Machel, his
wife, stood on a dais flanked by college and university presidents
as they addressed a crowd of about 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the end of the century and the millennium,'' Mandela
said. ``For those of us who have come (through) a long part of this
century, there is much cause for disappointment about what we
haven't been able to achieve. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``For you, the youth, the future beckons. It is now in your
hands to make the next century one in which the best of the human
spirit can truly triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   In his long struggle against apartheid in South Africa, Mandela
endured 27 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement,
after being convicted of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the
government by revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Even in prison, however, Mandela worked to educate fellow
prisoners and maintained contact with the African National
Congress. He was released from jail in February 1990, to a hero's
welcome, was elected president of the Republic of South Africa in
1994 and went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Machel, the former minister of education in Mozambique, brought
the plight of children in war to the world's attention through a
groundbreaking report presented to the United Nations. She recently
became the first woman and first black to lead the University of
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and Machel were each presented with honorary associate
of arts degrees from Seattle Central Community College and
doctorates from Seattle University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Seattle Central announced a $30,000 endowment, and
the University of Washington a $50,000 endowment, for new
scholarships named after Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't you just feel the electricity in that room?'' said
Kirsten Anderson, a junior at Pacific Lutheran University, after
the convocation.
</P>
<P>
   With a nod of agreement, her friend Lindsay Daehlin added: ``It
was really great that he wanted to talk to the students.''
</P>
<P>
   For about 40 minutes, Mandela and Machel responded to prepared
question from students. Following are some of their comments:
</P>
<P>
   Mandela on why he's not special: ``It is a mistake to think that
I'm the only person who spent a long time in prison, in an
apartheid prison. There were many men and women, some of them who
deserve more credit than I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as becoming the first black to be elected president of
South Africa, it never occurred to me that one day I would have
that position. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the product of a collective leadership. It had no
significance to us who held a particular position because we were
placed there by a team of men and women who, under very difficult
circumstances, had triumphed to become a pathfinder in a new South
Africa. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I did did not generate from my brain or from my
spirit. It was something in which we all contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Machel on AIDS: ``We need vaccines and we need to make vaccines
available to everyone. But we need to look at reality. Before
vaccines can be approved and tested, we have to get the message
across, because time is running against us. ... While the vaccine
doesn't come, please share your knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela on the World Trade Organization: ``There are many
organizations in the world that have emerged which are an
expression of globalization. It is a process no country can avoid,
because today the things that take place in the People's Republic
of China immediately have an effect on South Africa, Morocco,
Seattle, and in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The WTO) is an organization we all must support because it
has many advantages. But of course, we must take account of
reality. Power today is still monopolized by the West, and their
moral fabric leaves much to be desired. They use world trade in
order to make a maximum profit, not for humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela on Cuba, Libya and Iran: ``There is no country anywhere
_ and I'm tempted to exaggerate and to say no force whatsoever in
the universe _ that can dictate to South Africa what it must do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemies of the United States are not our enemies, and if
the United States thinks they can dictate to South Africa, they are
living in dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from the apartheid movement and certain far-seeing and
bold-minded Americans, the government of the United States
supported our oppressors, the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba, Libya and Iran gave us enormous support. It would be a
tragedy if, ... now that we are free, we are advised by the friends
of our former enemies to break all allegiance with those who helped
us when we were all alone. No proud freedom fighter will ever do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Machel on when it's time to rest: ``Since the time I was a young
girl in my village (in Mozambique), there are many things that have
changed for the good ... but there are so many other things which
are exactly the same as when I was born. How can we rest? ... How
can one afford to think that I have the right to rest?''

ENOUGH'S ENOUGH, CANADIENS TELL ISLES

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ It may be difficult to fathom, but in one
sense the Montreal Canadiens came into Thursday night's game at the
Nassau Coliseum in more desperate straits than the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a marginally better record, the Canadiens had lost to
the Islanders twice, accounting for fully one-third of the Islander
victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   That must have been two too many for the Canadiens, who jumped
all over the Islanders' special teams Thursday night and emerged
with a 4-2 victory before 6,861 fans, stretching the home team's
losing streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a record sixth straight home loss for the Islanders,
who have won two games in the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, playing without Saku Koivu and Brian Savage, who
are both injured, jumped out to a 2-0 lead, courtesy of the first
of two goals from Martin Rucinsky, at 7 minutes 55 seconds, and the
first goal of the season by Benoit Brunet, at 11:24.
</P>
<P>
   With Mariusz Czerkawski in the penalty box for
obstruction-holding, Rucinsky skated across the blue line and took
a shot from 40 feet out that skipped off goalie Felix Potvin's
glove for the score, Rucinsky's 12th goal of the season. Brunet
made it 2-0 when he ferreted out the puck from a pile of Islanders
in front of the net and nudged it past the sprawled Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders did not get a shot off on their lone power play
chance of the period, but Tim Connolly kept them alive with a nice
play near the end of the period. Coming down the left side,
Connolly picked up the rebound of his own shot, scooted around the
back of the net and made a beautiful pass to the waiting Brad
Isbister, who put the puck in at 19:41 to cut the lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens made it two of three on power-play opportunities
at 2:37 of the second period, with Sergei Zholtok scoring off the
odd-man rush for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Orszsagh then brought the Islanders to within a goal
again at 10:06, coming up behind Josh Green as goaltender Jeff
Hackett kicked away his shot, picking up the rebound and neatly
putting the puck behind Hackett to make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders had two great chances to score early in the third
period, but Czerkawski's dead-on shot on a breakaway bounced
harmlessly off Hackett at 2:25 and Zdeno Chara's hard shot hit the
left post a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens put the game out of reach at 12:21 on Rucinsky's
second goal, scored past Potvin on his glove side after Shayne
Corson dug the puck out from the right corner, took it behind the
net and fed it to Rucinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, which snapped a four-game streak without a
victory, the Canadiens extended their record to 10-17-2. The
Islanders, who went 0 for 5 on power plays, fell to 6-16-3.  &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa,
had breakfast Thursday morning at the Lake Washington estate of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Bill and Melinda that I haven't got a word in English
to describe my impression of the house,'' Mandela recounted
afterward. ``I don't think beautiful, or exquisite, is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere during the three-day visit here that began on
Wednesday, Mandela took the baton and led the Seattle Symphony and
a high-school choir in a rendition of the South African national
anthem. He smiled graciously at a public school when questions from
students were read aloud, and one wanted to know what he had done
with his ``spare time'' during 27 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Among the subjects that Gates and Mandela discussed was a $750
million fund that Gates is setting up to help vaccinate children in
developing countries against deadly diseases. They also discussed a
newly formed foundation established by Mandela to promote health
care and education across the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Peace laureate sought Gates' support for his new
foundation. He also implored business leaders here and across the
country to get involved in a crusade to develop vaccines, including
one against the AIDS virus, and distribute them to rich and poor
alike around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children across Africa die every day because they don't have
access to vaccines that children in communities like Seattle take
for granted,'' Mandela, the 81-year-old former president and
anti-apartheid leader, said Thursday at a global health forum at
the University of Washington here.
</P>
<P>
   That Mandela and his wife, Graca Machel, would choose to make a
relatively extended trip to Seattle is a powerful demonstration of
the growing role of philanthropies based here in the Pacific
Northwest. Seattle is home to three of the world's richest men (
Gates, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Microsoft's President
Steve Ballmer), and the foundation established by Gates and his
wife recently became the biggest philanthropic organization in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Craig and Susan McCaw Foundation, also based here, helped to
sponsor the trip. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, is
chairman of Teledesic LLC and is hoping to develop an ``Internet in
the Sky'' satellite system, in part with backing from Gates'
company.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was to be the only stop on his trip to this country, but
the White House said Thursday that Mandela was likely to stop off
briefly in Florida on Saturday, on his way home, to meet with
President Clinton, who will be speaking to the state Democratic
convention there. The two plan to discuss Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's visit here has clearly given a needed lift to a city
still reeling from the aftermath of the protests that engulfed the
streets during last week's meeting here of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Mandelas reserved their highest praise for Gates. During a
brief interview Thursday morning, the two men were all smiles with
each other, and at one point Mandela placed his hand on Gates' knee
while recalling their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, anybody who is aware of what is going on in the world
knew of Bill even before you met him,'' Mandela said, ``and I had
the honor of meeting him in my official residence in 1997. And, as
usual, he was very generous.'' Ms. Machel, speaking of Gates before
the audience at the University of Washington, said, ``You are
gifted and you decided to use your gift to share with millions of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela spoke repeatedly of the need to develop a vaccine
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   After Gates spoke with some passion about his desire to develop
vaccines for a whole host of diseases, Mandela rose and mockingly
chided him for ``a very important omission'' in his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a vaccine against old age,'' the elder
statesman deadpanned, as his audience broke into laughter and
cheers. ``I hope that Bill will go to work to develop that
vaccine.''
