MILLER'S ACT ANNOYING TO LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until now, the Los Angeles Lakers have left most
of the grousing about officiating and star treatment to their
opponents. But in the wake of a 33-point loss to Indiana on Friday,
the Lakers aimed their ire at the Pacers' Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   He flops. He entangles. He draws fouls on the Lakers. And it
bugs the bejesus out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets away with so much of the flopping and so much of
launching himself, propelling himself into defenders that are just
standing around guarding other people,'' said Rick Fox. ``I don't
know if it's something he's done for so long that it's just
accepted now, and it's just part of his game, you just blow the
whistle whenever you see him flopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got a guy on our team that gets some good calls for
flopping, and he takes charges,'' Fox said, referring to teammate
Derek Fisher. ``With your home floor, they call it the way they do.
He likes that contact, Reggie likes to create the contact because
then it keeps the defender off-balance, it keeps the defender
hunting him out as the prey, and he's allowed to create contact and
flop like a 90-pound bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is notorious for extending his limbs as he shoots, trying
to catch a stray arm or leg of the defender. In the fourth quarter
of Friday's Pacers victory, Miller snared Fisher and flopped while
shooting a 3-pointer. The whistle blew, Fisher blew his lid and got
called for a technical foul, and Miller shot (and made) four free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller obviously kicked Fisher on that shot,'' Lakers coach
Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thug treatment: One foul Fox did not dispute was his collaring
of Austin Croshere late in the third quarter, which drew a flagrant
foul call. It turned into a 4-point play that increased Indiana's
lead from 15 points to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson questioned the wisdom of the play, but Fox had no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they've had their way all night scoring. At what point
do you give up another layup?'' Fox said. ``Then they go up 17, or
do you try to put a stop to that? At that point, we'd been down 15,
17, 20 points the whole game, and that flagrant foul was not going
to change the course of the game. If anything, it would maybe
change it to another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive: The Lakers surrendered a postseason-high 120 points
and 57.4 percent shooting to the Pacers, but the NBA's best
defensive team in the regular season still believes in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worried about that at all,'' Ron Harper said. ``The
only thing we gotta do is come out and have energy and we're all
right. And I guarantee you, that it ain't the same thing out there
(in Game 6) I bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall return,'' Harper vowed. ``We shall return.''
</P>
<P>
   Home again: Only Portland has beaten the Lakers at Staples
Center in the playoffs. And the Lakers are 3-0 at home against
Indiana this season. But no one is assuming trends will
automatically hold as the series shifts back to L.A. for Game 6
and, if necessary, Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't guarantee them an automatic win,'' Fox noted. ``We
came (to Conseco Fieldhouse) and got one ourselves. We've had
success at home all year, but nothing's guaranteed right now, not
when you give a team a little life support system in Game 5.''

AFTER KO VICTORY, MORALES EYES TITLE TRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just before ``Destiny'' - the main event's billing
- hit Staples Center in the form of the Oscar De La Hoya-Shane
Mosley welterweight championship bout, Erik Morales was designing
his own fate during Saturday's undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, of Tijuana, knocked out Mike Juarez, of Omaha, at 1:12
of the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it being the first time Morales (37-0, 29 KOs) moved up
to the featherweight division, it was the third time he introduced
Juarez (22-9-1) to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference for me was my stamina,'' Morales said.
``This weight is good for me. At 122 pounds I wasn't able to move
and do the things that I wanted to do because I was too weak. I did
feel stronger with my punches and just plain stronger at this
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory will likely set up a title fight between Morales
(37-0, 29 KOs) and WBC featherweight champion Guty Espadas on Sept.
2. It would take place either in San Diego or Morales' native
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of bulk vs. height, bulk won.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch, who has turned himself into
a curious national phenomenon, knocked out Kansas City's Kerry
Biles (6-foot-6, 266 pounds) at 2:52 of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Esch (6-0, 333) did not attract his following from slick boxing
skills or good looks.
</P>
<P>
   After dominating Biles (2-2) in the first round, Esch left his
guard down briefly and took a stiff jab from Biles.
</P>
<P>
   Esch left his hands down and invited Biles to deliver a
combination which landed square in Esch's face. All Esch did was
smile and giggle a bit before knocking Biles out with a right
cross.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous bout in his first big fight - a loss to Floyd
Mayweather on May 22 - Uganda's Justin Juuko gave Diego Corrales
more of a fight than anticipated. Corrales, of Sacramento, finally
knocked out Juuko at 2:35 of the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a million punches,'' Corrales said. ``It took
everything I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia St. John of Calabasas won a unanimous decision over Linda
Robinson (3-1) of Texas in a women's featherweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   St. John lifted her record to to 18-0 after controlling the
majority of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Shannon Taylor (27-0-1) won a unanimous decision over
Charles Whitaker (17-9) of the Cayman Islands.

Astros' Wagner finds sixth inning just as vexing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ So much for Billy Wagner sitting on the dock of the
bay and clearing his head, free of the pressures of pitching when
the game is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   When Astros manager Larry Dierker had to make a decision
regarding how to get his team through what turned out to be the
most crucial situation of Saturday's game, he gave the ball to the
man to whom he had turned on so many occasions.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the ninth inning, but it was pressure nonetheless, and
the result was about as melodic as a broken record. The Astros blew
a two-run lead after 5{ innings and lost 6-4 to the San Francisco
Giants at Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who one day earlier had been stripped of his closer's
role, entered the game with a 4-3 lead, two out and two runners on
in the sixth inning. He walked each of the four batters he faced
and threw a wild pitch in what became a four-run, game-winning
rally for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in 252 career appearances Wagner
failed to record an out, and it marked the first time he had walked
more than three batters in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just couldn't find the strike zone,'' Dierker said of
Wagner, who walked only three batters in the entire month of April.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's outing was a snapshot of what a struggling pitcher
goes through. Although Wagner walked a career-high four batters,
wild would not be the best word to describe his outing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost inexplicably, the Giants laid off some hittable pitches
that might have been called strikes under better circumstances for
the struggling lefthander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I made some good pitches,'' Wagner said.
``There are a lot of things going on this year that I've never
experienced. I know I'd love to be a hitter; just don't swing the
bat. The strike zone is as tight as ever. I've heard 50,000
theories on what's wrong with Billy Wagner. Ask the guys in the
other clubhouse; I'm no different than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics don't tell the entire story, but they suggest
something is different from a year ago when Wagner walked only 23
batters in 74 innings. He has walked 18 batters in 47 fewer innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, if Wagner got himself into trouble with walks, he
usually could get out of it with strikeouts. But his strikeouts
have been on the decline even though his velocity and movement are
well above average. Nevertheless, Wagner is on pace to finish with
his lowest strikeout total (69) since 1996, when he had 67
strikeouts in 37 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there's just no explanation,'' Giants manager Dusty
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as perplexing was why Dierker used Wagner in such a
situation one day after the club decided he needed a break from the
so-called pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure,'' Dierker said. ``But it was the middle of
the game, and if he had problems we still had time to come back. We
had time, but we didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to find an easier situation, but this was a day we
were going to get him in a game. We're going to try to get him in a
game every other day, and we're not always going to be able to
manufacture opportunities where we have a three- or four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not unaccustomed to pressure. He's come through very well
in pressure situations up until this year. You can't protect
players at this level. We're not into development. That's for the
minor leagues, and he's not going to the minor leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a 2-0 lead against Astros starter Jose Lima
(1-10) in the first inning on an RBI single by Jeff Kent and a
sacrifice fly by J.T. Snow. But the Astros scored a run in the
second and three in a third-inning rally highlighted by Moises
Alou's two-run double off Giants starter Livan Hernandez (5-6).
Unfortunately for the Astros, they managed only five hits the rest
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances, we just didn't get the big hits,'' Astros
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants reclaimed the lead with four runs in the sixth, and
despite Wagner's struggles, he could have gotten out of the fix
with the one-run lead intact if not for a defensive lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Converted first baseman Daryle Ward, making just his second
start in right field this season, misplayed Bill Mueller's pop foul
that should have been the third out of the inning. Instead, Mueller
got new life and drew a walk to load the bases. Barry Bonds'
bases-loaded walk forced home the tying run, and the Giants scored
the go-ahead run on a wild pitch. A bases-loaded walk plated the
final run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind played a part and I was also looking out for the
(bullpen) mound,'' Ward said. ``When I looked back up, the ball was
behind me. I was trying to protect myself; I didn't want to fall on
that mound. This was my first game playing the outfield in San
Francisco. I'll know what to expect next time.''

Cresse comes through as LSU wins fifth title
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
OMAHA, Neb. _ Maybe they should change the name here to Eaux-maha,
since LSU appears to have taken up residence.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers got a single to left field by catcher Brian Cresse to
score Ryan Theriot from second base in the bottom of the ninth
inning, and LSU slipped past Stanford 6-5 in an exhilarating finish
to win the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The hit turned the infield at Rosenblatt Stadium into an
impromptu Louisiana-flavored party, missing only boudin and gumbo.
Players piled on top of Cresse around the shortstop position.
Weeping relatives wearing Mardi Gras beads surrounded the players.
Fans scooped up dirt to put in bottles to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse's single enabled LSU to win its fifth national
championship before 24,282 on Saturday, with the four previous
titles coming in the 1990s. LSU tied Arizona State for the
second-most national championships behind Southern California's 12.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse said he had always dreamed of a game-winning hit in a
championship contest. In fact, he had a similar dream Friday night
before the title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is going to sound corny,'' he said. ``But before I
went to sleep last night, I dreamed I would hit a home run to win
the game. I'll take a single.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Trey Hodges of Klein Oak, not Cresse, was named the
tournament's Most Valuable Player. He pitched in three games,
winning two, and had an ERA of 1.69 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges matched Stanford pitcher Justin Wayne _ the fifth overall
pick in the pro draft earlier this month by Montreal _ pitch for
pitch and kept the Tigers in the game. He allowed two hits and no
runs in four innings of relief, earning the win to up his record to
5-2. He had surgery last year and began throwing well toward the
end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm was kind of sore today,'' said Hodges, who was drafted
in the 17th round by the Atlanta Braves. ``But after Jeremy's home
run, all the soreness left me. I really thought we were going to
win the game eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Witten hit a two-run homer that tied the score at 5 in
the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   LSU coach Skip Bertman called it his most satisfying national
championship because the team overcame multiple injuries to go 13-0
in the postseason. He also put to rest rumors that he might retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going one year at a time since 1997,'' Bertman said.
``I'm going to be back. I promised the recruits I'll be here. But I
only do it for one year at a time. It would have been tempting to
do a Dick Vermeil.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama started in the eighth inning when Blair Barbier hit a
solo homer to draw LSU to within 5-3. Three batters later, Witten's
blast tied it.
</P>
<P>
   The big blow for Stanford had been a fourth-inning grand slam by
Craig Thompson off of LSU starter Brian Tallet to give the Cardinal
a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Hodges put Stanford down in order in the top of the ninth,
Theriot singled to start the winning rally. Mike Fontenot followed
with a walk to set up Cresse's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse, who led the nation with 30 homers, had struggled in the
CWS with only one other hit in the Series. He said Bertman told him
even though there were no outs, he did not consider having Cresse
bunt the two runners into scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has trusted me all year long, and trusted me that I
would get the hit,'' Cresse said. ``When I hit the ball, I knew it
was in the outfield. I saw them waving him in and then I knew he
was going to score.''
</P>
<P>
   It was defense early in the game that kept the Tigers within
striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, LSU right fielder Ray Wright made a leaping
catch against the wall on what would have been a solo homer by
Stanford's Edmund Muth. In the sixth, LSU Barbier made a diving
stop behind third base on a grounder hit by Chris O'Riordan with
the bases loaded. Barbier made the cross-diamond throw to nip
O'Riordan at first for the inning-ending out to save at least one
more run.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford coach Mark Marquess said it was a great game, but a
tough one to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a call or a bad bounce that beat us, '' he said.
``They beat us. We didn't give it to them. The catch (by Wright)
and the two home runs came in big spots. They deserve it, they did
a great job.''

Awed field gives Woods a perfect 10
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Tiger Woods is so far ahead in the U.S. Open
that he could let Jean Van de Velde pinch hit for him today and
still win.
</P>
<P>
   Woods survived his version of Van de Velde's British Open horror
show, shrugging off a triple bogey on No. 3 Saturday, then knuckled
down to shoot an even-par 71 in the third round and take an
astounding 10-stroke lead into the final round today.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is at 8-under-par 205 and his advantage is the biggest
54-hole spread in Open history, toppling the seven-shot lead Jim
Barnes had in 1921. There is nobody at Pebble Beach who isn't
impressed with what he is doing as he embarrasses the rest of the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tiger is doing is incredible,'' Fred Couples said. ``I
don't see anyone catching him. We all know he's very good and this
proves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lapping the field on a very, very hard course, and
there's not any question by far who is the best player. If it (the
wind) blows Sunday, he can shoot 80 and still win.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't shoot 80. In fact, Woods seems on track to do
exactly what he did at the 1997 Masters when he was nine strokes
ahead after three rounds and cruised to a 12-shot victory for his
first major championship. Today, he will earn major No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   His lead is so outrageous, even Woods has never dreamed of
having it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a lead like this, even in fantasy golf,'' he
said. ``I've dreamed of winning the U.S. Open, but it's usually
against Jack (Nicklaus) or Arnie (Palmer) or (Ben) Hogan, and we're
always neck-and-neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is so far ahead that he likely has eliminated any fear of
coughing up the lead. He's three years wiser than he was at Augusta
in '97. And he didn't falter then, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Augusta, I had a nine-shot lead after three rounds,'' Woods
said. ``Now, I'm ahead by 10 shots. It's the same thing _ just go
out there and play one shot at a time. I did that in '97, stayed in
the present and I'm going to try to do the same thing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let your intensity deplete. If you give your
opponent some hope, they could turn the tide and get close to you,
if not past you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. In fact, most everybody is talking like the only
tournament left is the one for second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I wasn't too impressed the first two
days, because he does it all the time,'' Rocco Mediate said. ``But
what he's doing today is just scary after making triple on one
hole. It's amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely mortal. We all are. He is not. Once in a while,
we can beat him. But nobody's going to catch him this week.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday when the scoring average was 77.124, Woods' 71
tied him for the second-lowest round of the day. Only Ernie Els,
who shot a remarkable 3-under 68, broke par.
</P>
<P>
   Els moved from a tie for 36th to second with his round and will
be paired with Woods today in the final 18-hole coronation.
</P>
<P>
   Els is talking a good game. But he seems to already know that it
will be mission impossible for him to track down Woods. He also
said it should make for great theater today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for golf,'' Els said. ``In the '60s, you had Palmer.
In the '70s you had Nicklaus. Then you had (Tom) Watson. Now it
seems like we've got a dominant figure in Tiger. He's probably the
most recognizable sportsman on the planet right now. It's good for
golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would be even better for golf if someone could step up
and play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods showed his mettle Saturday by surviving the triple bogey
on No. 3. He hit his 7-iron approach shot on the 390-yard par-4
into the thick rough, and it took him five shots to negotiate the
remaining 20 yards to the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad swing on three that cost me three shots, but I
fought back,'' he said. ``That's what you need to do in the U.S.
Open. You're not going to hit every shot good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one bad break at three, but other than that, I played
well. If you put the ball in that rough, it's going to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods added that he's a little surprised that he's 8 under par
and nobody else is better than 2 over through 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises me that I was able to do it (get a 10-shot lead)
in a U.S. Open. because in an Open it's very difficult to go low,''
he said. ``I made my share of mistakes. But I've made a few putts
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who started the round with a six-shot lead over Miguel
Angel Jimenez, never saw it go lower than five, which is what it
was after the triple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   But he turned things around at the par-5 sixth hole. His second
shot came to rest on the edge of a bunker 65 yards from the hole.
He had an awkward stance, with one foot in the sand and one on the
lip of the bunker. His ball was in hay-length grass, but with a
reasonable lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to hit a shot up there on the green or short of
the green and get my par and move on,'' Woods said. ``But the ball
rolled up to the hole and I had about 10 feet left, and Stevie
(Williams, his caddie) said it was an important putt and I hit that
thing right in the middle of the cup.''
</P>
<P>
   He also birdied the par-3 seventh from 10 feet to get back to 8
under, then mingled two bogeys with two birdies the rest of the
way. The only hole on which he had to avert another possible big
number was the 10th, where he hit his second shot onto the cliff
leading down to the Pacific Ocean and had to chop out. He took the
swing and wound up with a sore right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a rock right in front of my ball and I knew to hit
the shot I was going to have to hit the rock, too,'' he said. ``It
felt like one of my calluses ripped. But it's fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   Left in Woods' wake is Els, who knows he is virtually helpless
to play for anything but second place today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to shoot another score like this,'' he said after his
68, ``and see what happens. I have to feel like I'm in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Woods, today's walk around Pebble Beach won't be any
different than the first three, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've woken up with the same game plan every day _ to keep the
ball in the fairway,'' he said. ``It's virtually impossible to get
the ball close if you're playing from the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were merely preparing their concession speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something dramatic happens, he's the winner already,''
said Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's always a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be caught,'' said David Duval. ``It's very easy to
shoot 6, 7, 8, 9 over and not really hit bad shots.''
</P>
<P>
   It has happened to just about everybody at the Open. Except one
person.

PALMEIRO MAKES NAME FOR HIMSELF _ THE PEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Orlando Palmeiro is known around the league as the
``other'' Palmeiro, but Rafael's cousin has quietly made a name for
himself in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was a 33rd-round draft choice out of the University of
Miami in 1990, first reached the big leagues in 1995 and is making
a career for himself as a utility outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is hitting .329, getting an occasional start in the
outfield or as the designated hitter, or serving as a pinch hitter.
He has no power - only one career homer - but he's a pest at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   His .425 on-base percentage is second on the team to Troy Glaus'
.427. His batting average is second to Darin Erstad's .367. He
makes a pitcher work, drawing walks and fouling off pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was his third start in five games, and he's started 17
overall (six in left, six in right, five as the DH). He's hit
safely in 15 of his 17 starts, batting .351 (20 for 57). But he
said he doesn't feel pressure to play his way into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of it as having to `earn' my starts,'' Palmeiro
said. ``When I get a chance to do what I can do, I want to be able
to perform. I want to help the team however I can, on or off the
field. If that means giving somebody a day off or picking somebody
up or even taking infield, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for me is not to try to do too much. I'll never fill
Darin's shoes. I'll never fill Garret's (Anderson) shoes. What can
I do? See a lot of pitches, help tire a pitcher out. I can't hit
fourth or fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has been consistent wherever or whenever he's playing.
He hit .320 in April, .320 in May and is hitting .350 in June. He's
hitting .300 in day games, .340 in night games. He's hitting .313
with runners in scoring position. And most importantly, he is
hitting .359 with two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Batting ninth Saturday, he led off the second inning and fell
behind in the count, 1-2. He fouled off three pitches, then was hit
by a pitch. Later in the inning he scored from second on a single
to left by Tim Salmon, using a nice slide to get past catcher Greg
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield throws: Pitcher Kent Bottenfield made 80 pitches
during a bullpen workout Saturday and is on track to return to the
starting rotation Saturday against the Twins in Anaheim.
Bottenfield, who went on the DL June 8 with shoulder tendinitis,
has one more test to pass a simulated game Tuesday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   In a rehab start for Triple-A Edmonton on Friday night, Jason
Dickson gave up eight runs and eight hits in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he needs a little more time,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``His command was not as crisp as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson is trying to return from a strained left hip flexor.

National television audience witnesses Woods' profane outburst
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Hopefully, the kids weren't channel surfing
Saturday morning at about 10 a.m. expecting to get Bugs Bunny or
the Roadrunner on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   If they were, they got a big dose of expletives from Tiger Woods
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was on the 18th tee finishing his second round when he
pull-hooked his tee shot into the Pacific Ocean. If the first two
words out of his mouth wouldn't get a motion picture an `R' rating,
the third one most certainly would have. In the comics, they use
&AMP;%$ to say what Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods gathered himself, re-teed and went on to bogey the hole.
But the damage had been done. His foul language was beamed live and
uncensored throughout the country. NBC had added the morning
coverage of the U.S. Open mainly because of the allure Woods has.
He played seven holes Saturday morning to finish his second round.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of his management team, Woods later would
apologize for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the heat of the moment,'' said Woods, who finished
Saturday's third-round action with a 10-stroke lead. ``I was
frustrated to end a round like that. And unfortunately, I let it
slip out. I regret that it happened, and I can apologize until I'm
blue in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a very frustrating moment and I just let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that most fans enjoy seeing Woods wear his emotions
openly on the golf course. Golf is in need of charisma, and Woods
has it. But he also has uttered many curse words on the course in
different tournaments. Usually, however, they don't end up on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time,'' said Tom Kite. ``I just hate to see
Tiger do stuff like that. I hope he shows some remorse later for
what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   What irks some players and spectators is that Woods mutters
things that nobody else is saying on the PGA Tour _ not audibly,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard Jack (Nicklaus) say it,'' Kite said. ``I never
saw Arnold (Palmer) do it. I never saw (Tom) Watson do it. And I
doubt Bobby Jones ever did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that kind of language is more commonplace in our
society now. But it doesn't belong out here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most PGA Tour players have a slip of the tongue
periodically. And they wonder if people who are driving in traffic
and get cut off can hold their emotions as well as golfers do on
most occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the worst thing Tiger does in 20 years out here,
that'll be great,'' said Fred Couples. ``He's no worse than anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument can be made that microphones shouldn't be within
shouting distance of the players, either. But the reactions of
professional athletes have become part of what fans expect to see
and hear during the course of competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mike's not there, you're offending people standing at
the tee,'' Kite said. ``In my opinion, it just doesn't belong.''
</P>
<P>
   All PGA Tour players know that basic golf etiquette is expected
from them. Any time a player voices an obscenity and is reported by
a marshal or fan, he usually receives a fine from the PGA Tour
office.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, handling emotions is one of the toughest parts of
playing competitive golf, said Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take responsibility for your actions and
comments,'' Els said. ``Golf is not a contact sport. But when it
gets tense on the course and things don't go your way, you are
going to say some things. I've said some things and gotten away
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that emotions such as what Woods displayed Saturday
seem to boil over at just the wrong time?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the U.S. Open,'' Els said. ``You try to do the perfect
thing. But it's the U.S. Open, and it's very difficult to deal with
out there.''

BELCHER BACK, WELL-ARMED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ He's 38 years old and has a five-inch scar on his
right elbow, but Tim Belcher showed the Baltimore Orioles on
Saturday night there's more to pitching than a young, strong arm.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start of the season after off-season elbow
surgery, Belcher held the Orioles to one run and five hits in 5
innings in the Anaheim Angels' 8-3 victory before 45,758 at Camden
Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher (1-0) got all the help he needed from Troy Glaus, Garret
Anderson and Mo Vaughn. Glaus hit a two-run homer (No. 19) in the
second inning, Anderson hit a three-run homer (No. 17) in the third
inning and Vaughn hit a solo homer (No. 20) in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive outburst came after they scored a total of six
runs during a three-game losing streak, but Belcher was the story
on this night.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was expected back in early May but suffered a setback in
his recovery and had to stop throwing. But he came back strong in
his first major-league start since Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled early as he needed 58 pitches to finish two
innings, but he made big pitches to get out of both innings
unscathed. In the first inning, he walked the first two batters
then struck out Delino DeShields to bring up Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `OK, dummy, you just walked two guys to get to
the hottest hitter on the planet,''' Belcher said.
</P>
<P>
   But Belcher got Belle to hit into a 4-6-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, the Orioles had the bases loaded, two out
and a full count on Brady Anderson, who was caught looking at a
fastball for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady's a tough guy for me,'' Belcher said. ``I made a good
pitch on the outside part of the plate. He probably thought it was
off the plate, and maybe it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher settled down after the second inning, allowing only two
more hits until Belle led off the sixth with a home run. Belle has
six homers and 16 RBI in his past four games. But that was all the
Orioles could muster off Belcher, who left the game with one out in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belcher has a great history behind him,'' said Angels manager
Mike Scioscia, who caught Belcher with the Dodgers. ``He's pitched
in playoffs and the World Series. His stuff is not what it was 10
years ago, but he has great presence out there, and he's a true
competitor. He brings a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's fastball reaches only 88 or 89 mph, but his slider and
splitter worked well for him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bench coach) Joe Maddon made the comment after the game that
stuff-wise, the break on my slider and the quality of my splitter
was as good as he's ever seen it,'' Belcher said. ``I need to do
that. Obviously, I'm not going to throw my fastball by too many
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher admitted that at this stage of his career there are no
guarantees he could still pitch at the major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything held together,'' he said. ``I tried not to have too
unrealistic expectations. I told myself no matter what I do or how
it goes, if I get killed or pitch well, as long as I come out of
the game and feel well, I have to give myself a little bit of
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure anybody my age, coming off an injury, to go out and
compete and get myself out of jams and throw 100 pitches and come
back in five days, is a small victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's teammates agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back and throw as well as he threw, it's almost like
the surgery made him stronger,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   For Anderson, the homer came after one day's benching and an
equipment adjustment. Scioscia gave Anderson the game off Friday so
his center fielder could relax a little after a 1-for-15 slump.
Anderson had only two RBI in his previous 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson went back to using a lighter bat (Orlando
Palmeiro's), making him quicker through the strike zone, and the
change paid off. The heavier bat might have helped him hit more
home runs, but it made his average suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to a much bigger bat (this season),'' Scioscia said.
``He came to the realization he has a lot more bat control (with a
lighter bat) and can be much more consistent as a run-producer in
the fifth spot with a bat he can handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia first intended to give Anderson a day off Saturday as
well, but Anderson talked Scioscia out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in there and told him I wanted to play,'' Anderson
said. ``I didn't give him any excuses, and he believed what I said
was true. I said I was fine.''

MOSLEY BEATS DE LA HOYA FOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, it didn't come down to who was bigger,
stronger, more experienced, quicker or more focused. It came down
to who was better.
</P>
<P>
   And, in spite of the opinion of one judge who will be criticized
by some in the days to come, it was Shane Mosley who was the better
fighter as he defeated Oscar De La Hoya by a split decision before
20,744 completely satisfied fans Saturday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lou Filippo scored it 116-112 while Pat Russell had it
115-113 in favor of Mosley. Marty Sammon certainly was in the
minority when he scored it 115-113 in favor of De La Hoya. The
Daily News had 116-112 Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley, the victory gives him the WBC welterweight
championship and removes any doubt as to his place in the boxing
world: A great champion was born this day.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed all the things associated with such a fighter -
skill, speed, power and tremendous courage and determination.
Although he appeared to be ahead, he stood toe-to-toe with De La
Hoya in an unforgettable 12th round for the sole purpose of showing
how big his heart is, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley (35-0, with 32 knockouts) has some multi-million-dollar
paydays in his near future.
</P>
<P>
   For De La Hoya, this hurts. The Golden Boy, once the king of his
sport in many respects, has lost his last two big fights. He also
was outpointed by Felix Trinidad in September.
</P>
<P>
   If he had an aura of invincibility, it's long gone and we're
left to wonder where he goes from here.
</P>
<P>
   However, this certainly isn't the end for two reasons: the way
he lost and the fact Mosley is expected to give him an immediate
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times in recent years, De La Hoya (32-2, 26
KOs) did exactly what he said he'd do - go after Mosley throughout
the fight even if it meant risking his own well being.
</P>
<P>
   He absorbed considerable punishment as a result of his strategy,
mostly quick, straight right hands that rocked but never seriously
hurt him. Even when it became apparent that he was a beaten man, De
La Hoya kept coming. Those who have doubted his courage will have
to admit that.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch? Mosley said emphatically before the fight that
there would be one because De La Hoya had given !ital!him!off! a
tremendous opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed the first installment will be thrilled if it
actually happens. They got their money's worth in the first truly
big fight in Los Angeles in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Mosley said when asked if there would be a
rematch. ``A fight that close, there has to be. We showed there are
two great champions from California.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was diplomatic afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' he said. ``It was a great fight. What
can I say? We put on a great show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, a rematch has to happen. I'll just rethink my game
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Again, De La Hoya, who had predicted he would knock out each of
his four opponents in 2000, executed his prefight strategy: He
stalked Mosley throughout.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mosley, the quickest fighter De La Hoya has seen, coped
wonderfully. Like a powerful cat, he leaped in, did his damage with
body shots and the rights and then quickly moved out of harm's way.
He also confused De La Hoya by switching to a left-handed stance on
several occasions, a testament to his ring acumen.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was in punching range, De La Hoya somehow was unable
land clean, telling shots consistently. Mosley, rarely in the wrong
place at the wrong time, was much better defensively than many had
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley also removed any doubt about his strength. Many believed
De La Hoya would be too strong for the challenger because Mosley
had recently moved from 135 pounds to 147, De La Hoya's weight
class the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   However, this was never evident. He took many good shots and
while he couldn't put De La Hoya, it was his punches that did the
most significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive was Mosley's determination.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was very much in doubt going into the final three
rounds. And it was Mosley, not the supposedly stronger De La Hoya,
was looked fresher, stronger and more confident.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley won two of the final three rounds on two cards and all
three on the third to win the fight and the hearts of all those who
watched him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I was stronger at 147,'' Mosley said. ``He hit me
with good, crisp shots but never dazed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I showed the world in the 12th round what kind of fighter
I am by standing in front of him and - win, lose or draw - fighting
like a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, CompuBox statistics were fairly even.
</P>
<P>
   De la Hoya connected on 257 of 718 punches, Mosley 284 of 678.
De La Hoya landed 165 power shots, Mosley 174.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was awarded the WBC championship when Felix Trinidad
vacated the title. He has held five titles in four weight classes.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is the former IBF lightweight champion. He defended his
title - which he won by beating Philip Holiday in August of 1997 -
eight times before skipping the 140-pound class and moving to 147.
</P>
<P>
   All of his defenses ended in knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the fight, Mosley was believed to have the highest
knockout rate of any fighter to win a title: 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters turned pro around the same time, De La Hoya in
November of 1992, Mosley in February of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   However, De La Hoya, armed with the United States' only gold
medal in the 1992 Olympics, took the boxing world by storm.
</P>
<P>
   He fought in big-money, high-profile events from the start and
won his first title - the WBO junior lightweight championship - in
only his 12th fight. He stopped Jimmi Bredahl in March of 1994 to
win the belt.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who failed to make the Olympic team and had a novice
promoter early in his career, beat Holiday in his 24th bout.

CATCH HIM IF YOU CAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ His ball was in thick rough, the stance
dictated he had to hit out sideways, the wind was howling, and
scores were soaring like desert temperatures in July. So after
taking three hacks at it and making triple bogey at the par-4 third
hole, Tiger Woods was in big trouble Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Right, and the price of real estate on 17 Mile Drive will go
down when this championship leaves town.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, if you are going to make a triple bogey, it's
advisable to do so when you have an eight-shot lead, which is the
scenario Woods faced as he did his Gil Morgan impression on No. 3.
But we know Tiger Woods, and Tiger Woods is no Gil Morgan, which
explains why he is in total control of the 100th US Open at Pebble
Beach Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to play a safe shot,'' said Woods of the
travails at the third. He recovered with three birdies in four
holes, starting at the par-5 sixth, then added a little bit of
frosting by reaching the par-5 14th in two glorious shots _ a drive
of 320 yards and a 2-iron from 253. After he two-putted for his
fifth birdie of the day, Woods parred his way home to shoot 71_205,
at 8 under the only player in the field in red numbers. Oh, and he
has a 10-shot lead over his nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that player was Ernie Els, whose 68_215 was the
only subpar score handed in on a day when the wind howled at a
steady 20 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Was he back in it, at 2 over? Els, who passed 34 players, put on
the rose-colored glasses and said: ``I have to believe that,
yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   He has to say that because USGA bylaws require that 72 holes be
played to determine a US Open championship, so Els will join Woods
at the first tee in the final pairing Sunday. The only question is
how many records Woods will set as he marches toward something that
is quite similar to his 12-shot win at the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods negotiated his first hurdle by answering his early
wake-up call to get to the course at 6:30 and complete his second
round in 69_134, he tied a US Open record for lowest 36-hole score
and set a new mark for largest lead (six shots). Now he owns the
largest 54-hole lead and needs to shoot 66_271 to establish a US
Open victory standard.
</P>
<P>
   But that is all incidental stuff to Woods, whose performance on
the day _ when the field average was 77.124 _ had even him dancing
for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. ``I just tried to play safe, figuring if I kept
it around par I would pick up some shots,'' said Woods. ``The golf
course was not playing easy. The conditions were severe out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they did not reach the proportions that plagued the final
round of this event here in 1992 _ in which Morgan became the only
player in US Open history to reach double digits under par, before
collapsing to the fifth page of the leaderboard _ Woods was correct
as 16 players shot in the 80s.
</P>
<P>
   They included Thomas Bjorn (82), who was in the lead group with
Woods, but was quickly lost in a sea of bogeys, joining befuddled
colleagues such as Colin Montgomerie (79_226), Sergio Garcia
(81_227), Hal Sutton (83_225), Vijay Singh (80_223), and Lee Janzen
(79_223).
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods had his problems, though he recovered from his third
hole to make easy pars at the fourth and fifth, then a
scintillating birdie at the par-5 sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He had driven it well right, into thick rough, and pulled his
second shot to the left of the fairway, right to the edge of a
bunker, ``into the hay.''
</P>
<P>
   He planted his right foot in the bunker, his left leg up on the
bank, choked down on a wedge, and punched his shot 64 yards to the
front of the green. It came to rest 12 feet above the pin and Woods
got some input from his caddie, Steve Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was an important putt, to bury it,'' said Woods,
who followed orders.
</P>
<P>
   Woods then went up-and-down in the wind _ a birdie at the
seventh, a bogey at the eighth, a birdie at the ninth, then a bogey
at the 10th when an approach shot ``got away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in a hazard, on the cliff leading to the beach, and
as spectators strolling in front of a roaring ocean looked on,
Woods saw some problems. A rock in front of his ball. ``If you're
going to hit the shot,'' he said to himself, ``you're going to have
to rip out that rock.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did, punching his shot to the front of the green, from
where he made bogey. But it was what they call a good bogey, one
that calmed him for an incoming eight-hole stretch that featured
seven solid pars and that superb birdie at the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who is in line to win his first US Open and third major
championship at the tender age of 24, has not joined Morgan as a
player to reach a double-digit red numbers in this championship _
but give him time, there are 18 more holes.
</P>
<P>
   They are 18 holes that promise to produce a bunch of guys who
feel like George Low, Val Fitzjohn, and W.H. Way. Those were the
gents who finished tied for second, 11 shots behind Willie Smith in
1899.

MOSLEY DETHRONES DE LA HOYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The crowd waited tensely in the long minutes after
the conclusion of 12 rounds of warfare Saturday night between Oscar
De La Hoya and Shane Mosley because no one knew for sure the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ring announcer Michael Buffer read the scorecards
before finally saying ``. . . and new . . .'' When he did, De La
Hoya's head slumped to his chest for a moment and then anger showed
through.
</P>
<P>
   He had lost for the second time in three fights. Lost the World
Boxing Council welterweight title. Lost even the designation as the
finest fighter in Los Angeles. Lost everything to former
lightweight champion ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya lost in spectacular fashion as he and Mosley put
on the kind of show that demanded what Mosley had already agreed to
and De La Hoya reminded him of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a rematch,'' De La Hoya (32-2) said. ``Every
great fight deserves one.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this one did because this was a great night of boxing
and a great night for boxing, a night when both the performers and
the judges did their jobs well.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, judge Lou Filippo scored the bout, 116-112, for
Mosley, Pat Russell had it 115-113 for the undefeated former
lightweight champion, and judge Marty Sammon had it 115-113 for De
La Hoya. The Globe card had Mosley a 115-113 victor by virtue of
winning the final five rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close fight,'' Mosley said. ``We went toe-to-toe for
12 rounds. We went soul-searching in that last round. We showed
we're both great warriors. Oscar is a great champion. I was just
the better man tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The better man entered the arena first, with his son and two
companions sauntering alongside him as if they were all going to
the park for a Saturday night ice cream. Suddenly, Mosley bolted
down the aisle and up the three steps that separated him from
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   As Mosley slipped through the ropes, he looked like a guy in
complete agreement with Lou Gehrig. ``Tonight I consider myself the
luckiest guy on the face of the earth,'' Gehrig once said. Mosley
didn't say it but he looked it as he waited for De La Hoya to join
him.
</P>
<P>
   As he bounced up and down in his corner, mariachi music blared
and De La Hoya arrived, a red hood over his head and a serious look
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   While Mosley smiled to the crowd, De La Hoya raised a gloved
fist to acknowledge the packed house, but otherwise was all
business as an explosion of fireworks ignited overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, it was Mosley who was igniting the fireworks,
pressing De La Hoya hard from the opening bell and turning the left
side of the champion's face red with his sharp jabs and quick
counters.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya quickly adjusted to Mosley's speed and began to
find him with his jab in the second round. He hurt Mosley with a
body shot on the inside that seemed to slow his aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley landed a right to the jaw early in the third that
momentarily slowed De La Hoya's jab. Mosley controlled most of the
third round with a sneaky lead right that twice landed, but a
left-right combination from De La Hoya was the most solid shot of
the round.
</P>
<P>
   Through four rounds, it was a back-and-forth affair but De La
Hoya appeared to be controlling the tempo, closing ground on Mosley
and forcing him to retreat over and over again after his initial
attack in Round 1. Mosley was scoring with his own jab and a lead
right but was unable to go to the body in the way he has done so
often in his eight lightweight title defenses.
</P>
<P>
   When De La Hoya had his jab working, Mosley was unable to attack
with ferocity, and late in Round 5, De La Hoya landed a
left-right-left combination that seemed to wobble Mosley before he
held on for the first time in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's face seemed less confident as he sat in his corner
after Round 6 listening to his father's instructions. For perhaps
the first time in his professional career, Mosley was now in a
fight in which he was not the boss, he was not dictating the terms
of the engagement, and he did not seem comfortable with his
circumstances, or willing to reassert his own will over De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth round, Mosley's best since the start of the fight,
he landed a jab with his left hand and then switched to southpaw
and landed a solid right a second later. For most of the eighth,
Mosley stayed southpaw and that switch slowed De La Hoya's jab and
turned him into a cautious observer.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley continued to come on in the ninth round as De La Hoya
appeared to tire as he had against Felix Trinidad in the only loss
of his career. Mosley's double jab and right hand did some serious
damage and when he rattled a combination off De La Hoya's face late
in Round 9, the crowd roared as the fight began to approach the
skilled savagery predicted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Rounds 10 and 11 were skillfully fought with Mosley now holding
his ground more often and landing more readily with a jab that
seemed to be bothering a tiring De La Hoya. As the final round
approached, both men knew these three minutes might decide who is
the pound-for-pound best fighter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Both fought furiously in the center of the ring in the final
round for more than a minute. Blood dripped from De La Hoya's nose
after one exchange and Mosley then rocked him with a solid shot
with two minutes to go, but the champion responded not by holding
on but by firing back as the crowd screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley landed a big right hand with 1:20 to go that shook De La
Hoya, and then another, and the champion wobbled and held on but
refused to fall. The effort left Mosley breathing heavily with :35
left, but instead of De La Hoya charging him, it was Mosley who
landed the last big punch of the night, one more furious right hand
just before the final bell sounded.
</P>
<P>
   When it did, both men smiled widely and embraced. Two champions
in the ring on this night, but only one victor.

ARTISTIC CHAMP TARNISHES GOLDEN BOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya might be the Golden Boy and might
be the most popular fighter in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But he's no longer the best one.
</P>
<P>
   That title now belongs to Sugar Shane Mosley, a 28-year-old from
Pomona who staged a fistic performance of exquisite artistry
Saturday night at Staples Center where he methodically took apart
De La Hoya across 12 rounds in a match that appeared to be
one-sided to everyone but the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, so much quicker than De La Hoya, landed the heavier
punches, especially during the, fourth, eighth and 12th rounds when
he violated De La Hoya with disdainful impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, so much slicker than De La Hoya, easily avoided his game
opponent's most ominous weapon - the left hook - throughout the
fight and never was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, so much better than De Hoya, dominated the proceedings
with a quick right hand that constantly found its mark, a bristling
jab that that did the same, and superior footwork.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite Mosley's performance that was right out of a
textbook authored by the likes of Sugar Ray Robinson and Jose
Napoles - he was that good to do what he did against a fighter of
De La Hoya's caliber - the boxing orbit almost received another
staggering blow afterward when Michael Buffer announced the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He first revealed that Lou Filippo had Mosley winning by a
116-112 margin, which was only a one-point difference from my
scorecard in which I had Mosley winning nine rounds for a 117-111
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But then Buffer said that a judge named Marty Sammon had De La
Hoya a 115-113 victor, much to the distress of the Mosley corner,
the shock of the De La Hoya corner and the outrage to anyone who
had witnessed the punishment Mosley had just meted out to De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Buffer's final announcement spared the sweet
science a most shameful development when he said that judge Pat
Russell saw it 115-113 for the new WBC welterweight champion of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Marty Sammon, and what was he looking at, WBC president
Jose Suliaman, a passionate De La Hoya advocate who just happens to
assign officials to cushy WBC title fights at glamorous cities in
foreign countries?
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is known Sammon is a WBC official, as is Lou
Filippo, an independent sort who was the one who voted for
Marvelous Marvin Hagler against Sugar Ray Leonard in their famous
1987 fight.
</P>
<P>
   What Sugar Shane Mosley, who a year ago was a lightweight and
who was expected by many observers to find the 12-pound jump to the
welterweight division to be too much against De La Hoya, did
Saturday night against De La Hoya defied all prefight expectations.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever before had struck De La Hoya with so many punches,
not Pernell Whitaker, not Ike Quartey, not Felix Trinidad, not
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But the CompuBox punch stats revealed that Mosley connected 284
times against De La Hoya, with many of the punches being straight
right hands thrown over De La Hoya's left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar De La Hoya is a great fighter, but I showed tonight that
I'm better,'' said Mosley, and who could argue with Mosley, except
a myopic fellow named Marty Sammon?
</P>
<P>
   The fight had its moments of drama, when both men would exchange
brisk flurries that evoked cheers from a celebrity-laden crowd
brimming with athletes like Mark McGuire, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille
O'Neal and actors like Sylvester Stallone, Denzel Washington and
Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   This time there can be no excuses offered by De La Hoya, who
whined that he was robbed against Trinidad even though he spent the
final three rounds of that fight trying desperately to hitchhike a
ride out of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This time, De La Hoya was beaten fair, square and brutally by
Mosley, a blur of a whirlwind who simply was too fast for De La
Hoya, who throughout his career had always been too fast for every
one of his opponents except Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Oscar De La Hoya didn't try.
</P>
<P>
   He pursued Mosley relentlessly throughout the fight, but he kept
getting beat to the punch in a cloying fashion that had to be
disheartening to so many in the crowd of 20,744, which cheered
loudly for the 2-to-1 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Ray Mosley was supposed to be too small and too
inexperienced for De La Hoya, who performed in several of these
high-profile exercises and who was supposed to finally display his
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   But Mosley exposed De La Hoya for what he is an exceptional
fighter with a firm heart who simply isn't in the class of the
Durans and Leonards.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sugar Shane Mosley, he might be.
</P>
<P>
   All he failed to do Saturday night was to stop De La Hoya, and
it seemed in that 12th round, in which he whacked De La Hoya around
the ring for most of the three minutes, that he might pull off such
an unexpected accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides De La Hoya, the biggest loser was Bob Arum, the Top Rank
promoter whose organization is linked so closely with De La Hoya,
whose sheen is now terribly tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya might still be the Golden Boy to his legion of
followers, but that nickname no longer fits in Southern California,
where Sugar Shane Mosley now is the king.

WOODS DOMINATING U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Tiger Woods proved the U.S. Golf
Association correct Saturday, demonstrating that par can be a
really great score in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in winds that gusted throughout his late-afternoon
round, the world's No. 1-ranked player overcame two bogeys, a
triple bogey and seemingly a week's worth of trouble shots to shoot
a third-round 71 at Pebble Beach Beach Golf Links - which all but
clinches the championship of the 100th Open.
</P>
<P>
   If the fat lady isn't singing yet, her vocal chords might never
recover by the time she starts belting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' latest effort - perhaps his most impressive of the week,
given the conditions - left him 8-under-par 205, 10 strokes ahead
of second-place Ernie Els, establishing an Open record for
third-round margin and left Els (215) with this daunting
proposition:
</P>
<P>
   Should Woods match par again in today's final round, his closest
opponent would have to break the Open single-round record of 63 by
two strokes just to secure a share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess tomorrow, when I go out there,'' Woods said, ``if I
play solid golf and play the way I know I can, then somebody is
going to have to shoot a really good number.''
</P>
<P>
   Els showed he was up for a challenge by shooting 68 Saturday -
best score of the third round by three shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my run-ins with Tiger in the past,'' Els said after
that round, which started nearly three hours earlier than Woods
teed off, enabling the South African to dodge much of the
third-round wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get more of those battles with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish, riding that 69 to a final-round pairing with
Woods today.
</P>
<P>
   Padraig Harrington of Ireland and Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain
are a stroke back of Els at 216, trailed by Phil Mickelson and
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabel (both 217) in an event that rivals
Woods' record 12-stroke domination of the '97 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've played better this year (at the Open) than I did
(at the Masters) in '97,'' Woods said. ``Just because of the fact
it's so much more difficult off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to pay a price for every missed fairway Saturday, but
fought back impressively, digging himself out of deep rough and
bunkers for dramatic par-saves or birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one bad break on No. 3 but other than that I thought I
played pretty good,'' said Woods, who had to come out of the rough
three times during that triple bogey on the third hole.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his other rough rough escapes were magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   He came out of the thick stuff twice to birdie the par-5,
513-yard, severely uphill sixth hole, hitting arguably his best
shot of the tournament in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Standing awkwardly with one foot in a bunker and the other in
calf-length rough, Woods hacked the ball to within six feet of the
flagstick for his second of five birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was some hay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He later saved par from a greenside bunker on No. 17, then
hacked out of fairway rough on No. 18 to nearly pull off a sixth
birdie on what was his 24th hole of the day.
</P>
<P>
   As did more than a third of the field, Woods had to get up early
for a 6:30 a.m. resumption of Friday's darkness-suspended second
round.
</P>
<P>
   He finished that round at 69 to tie the best 36-hole total in
Open history. By the time he was finished for the day, Woods had
spent 14 hours on the course, much of it in wind that was at its
gustiest when he was playing Pebble Beach's most-demanding stretch
of holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played I guess the toughest stretch - 8, 9 and 10 - in a
pretty good wind,'' said Woods, who negotiated that trio in bogey,
birdie, bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind is such a factor on this golf course,'' said Els.
``It's taken all week for the wind to start blowing and you're
going to see some really high scores now. I had a really major good
break not to play with too much wind on the first nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had no such break, nor did he break under the toughest
conditions he has faced all week.

MOSLEY'S STEP TOWARD GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the beginning of the 10th round of Saturday's
welterweight title fight between ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley and Oscar
De La Hoya, one veteran boxing writer said, ``He is a great
fighter.``
</P>
<P>
   But if Tony the Tiger had been speaking about Mosley, he simply
would have said, ``He's grrrrrrrreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mosley was all that - and then some in winning the World
Boxing Council and International Boxing Association belts from De
La Hoya on a split decision.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mosley's coming-out party, the one that brought him
greatness before a screaming Staples Center crowd of 20,744 that
watched what will certainly go down as one of the sterling fights
in L.A. history.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, of Pomona, was faster than East Los Angeles' De La Hoya.
He was just as strong, stronger even during a spectacular 12th
round where the two California warriors went toe-to-toe the entire
three minutes, Mosley nearly decking De La Hoya on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see in the 12th round, we went toe-to-toe and we did
some soul-searching to see who was the champion,'' Mosley said.
``And he went toe-to-toe with me the whole round. He was really
strong. He was fighting great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to show the world I was prepared to fight the whole
12 rounds. I had to show the world I was a true champion. I was
just the better man tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the fight, Mosley had said he was in search of
greatness. He said if he were ahead late, he would not turn his
back and run because he thought he had the fight won. Run, he did
not. Neither did De La Hoya, who may have lost, but while doing so
earned back some of the respect he forfeited after running from
Felix Trinidad Jr. in September.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Mosley's night. He was so good, it was scary. He
connected on 42 percent of his total punches, compared to only 36
percent for De La Hoya, who has never swung and missed so often
before. Mosley also had a 57 percent connect percentage on his
power punches, to just 37 percent to De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was very gracious, and appropriately complimentary
afterward. He even went so far as to say he was not disappointed
because the fans got a great fight.
</P>
<P>
   Even De La Hoya seemed to be in awe of ``Sugar'' Shane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' De La Hoya said. ``We fought a great
fight. People wanted to see a war and they got it. He was very
fast. I give him all the credit in the world. More power to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fighter who kept coming and was in great shape. I
gave a good effort and a great fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, there was a rematch clause in the contracts signed
for this fight. And both fighters said they definitely want to see
it come off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it has to happen,'' De La Hoya said. ``I am going to
have to change my game plan because Shane Mosley sidetracked me a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of a fight. Two classy L.A. guys giving a large
audience what it deserved, a slugfest with some of the most
beautiful work you'll ever see in a ring.
</P>
<P>
   And De La Hoya did not complain about the verdict. If anything,
he could have felt fortunate that one judge gave him the bout by
two points.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mosley, he, too, is looking forward to the rematch. When
he entered the ring, he had a big smile on his face, as if he was
about to go out onto the playground and join his friends. Fun, he
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in there warring and he was in there warring,'' Mosley
said. ``I showed I was the best in the world. He showed he was one
of the best in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't think for a moment that the great ``Sugar'' Shane
Mosley forgot about his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say hello to P-town,'' Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   You can also bet De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, will get his
guy back into the ring with Mosley as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Arum said, ``that is the fight we will make
next.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it would be just as great.

THE SHOW WAS `SPECTACULAR'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Well, Oscar De La Hoya knows a good show when he
sees one, especially when he's one of the boxers involved.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he's less in tune with happy endings. For the
second time in nine months, he failed to close with gusto and lost,
this time surrendering the WBC welterweight championship on a split
decision Saturday night to Shane Mosley before 20,744 raucous fans
at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know I have heart, and I'm a warrior in the ring,'' De
La Hoya said. ``What can I say? We put on a great show and had a
great fight, but I guess it went his way.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's only other loss, a 12-round decision to Felix
Trinidad in Las Vegas last September, was much different than this
setback. Back then, De La Hoya purposely danced and avoided
Trinidad the last two rounds because he thought was far enough
ahead on points.
</P>
<P>
   This time, De La Hoya (32-2, 26 knockouts) again asserted
himself - he was ahead on two of three cards after nine rounds -
but the last three rounds proved utterly decisive.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya didn't have enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley (35-0, 32 knockouts) was too quick and too assertive on
inside exchanges. It was Mosley, not De La Hoya, who won over the
crowd and responded to the exuberant cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley hails from Pomona and De La Hoya from Los Angeles, but
the early crowd reaction made it seem like Pomona was awfully far
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Shane all the credit in the world. He's a fast
fighter,'' De La Hoya said. ``I was really surprised the way he
kept on coming. I thought I gave a good effort and gave the crowd
their money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is everything to a boxer. In Mosley's case,
confidence was enough for him to overcome an escalation in weight
class and to pocket De La Hoya's crowd with the ease of a man
picking up a quarter from the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I had to show I'm a true warrior,'' Mosley said.
``Oscar's a great champion, and we put on a spectacular fight. But
I was just a better man tonight. I showed the world who Sugar Shane
Mosley is tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said a rematch !ital!has!off! to happen.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? This was a terrific night for boxing, a sport that
desperately needs such electrifying performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great fight like this deserves a rematch,'' De La Hoya said.
``It has to happen, but I also need to rethink my game plan.''

GALAXY FINALLY AWAKENS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You figure with a celebrity-filled mega-fight
nearby, a city nervously awaiting the Lakers' fate and a Tiger
roaring up north, the Los Angeles Galaxy could continue its
freefall down the Western Division standings, and all would be
forgotten by sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Galaxy players, who have grown tired of this
recent run of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Sigi Schmid admitted earlier in the week that panic hadn't
set in, but it was getting dangerously close.
</P>
<P>
   During this recent 1-3-4 stretch of eight games, Schmid said his
team lost focus after the allocation of Luis Hernandez. He said
they needed to regain their killer instinct, needed to find their
arrogance and that feeling of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Simon Elliott, as hot as anyone on the roster,
provided a much needed early spark. It was just what Schmid was
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   And the Galaxy followed suit Saturday night, attacking in waves,
getting contributions everywhere in a confidence-boosting 2-1
victory over Tampa Bay before 14,603 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Lagos scored in the 90th minute for Tampa Bay, but it
wasn't enough to spoil the Galaxy's first win since May 20,
snapping a four-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a win, but more than anything, we created chances as
much as we have in the last five weeks,'' said Schmid. ``As long as
we can build on that, we'll continue to get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who's leaving to join New Zealand's national team, will
miss the next three games and possibly four. But not before he
notched his third goal since April 29.
</P>
<P>
   On a free kick from 25 yards, Greg Vanney and Mauricio
Cienfuegos both faked shots with Elliott running on the goal.
Elliott curled a shot to the upper right of the net for a 1-0 lead
in the ninth minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon does a lot of work that people don't notice,'' said
Schmid. ``We decided on our first free kick to let Simon hit it.
Tampa Bay was going to expect Cienfuegos or Vanney to take it. If
you watch the goal, as Vanney approached, you see (Scott) Garlick
(goalkeeper) start to cheat a step because he thought Vanney was
going to hit it. Nobody has seen Simon hit one of those. It was a
perfectly placed shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was rookie Danny Califf's turn. From the right corner,
Vanney sent a cross into traffic, but Califf beat everyone to it,
heading his shot to the near post past Mutiny goalkeeper Scott
Garlick in the 39th minute, giving Califf his first career goal.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be enough as the Galaxy (7-3-6, 27 points) crept
closer to Kansas City (10-2-3, 33 points). The West Division
leading Wizards lost 4-1 to Dallas earlier in the day.

MOSLEY BEATS DE LA HOYA FOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, it didn't come down to who was bigger,
stronger, more experienced, quicker or more focused. It came down
to who was better.
</P>
<P>
   And, in spite of the opinion of one judge who will be criticized
in the days to come, it was Shane Mosley who was the better fighter
as he defeated Oscar De La Hoya by a split decision before 20,744
completely satisfied fans Saturday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lou Filippo scored it 116-112 while Pat Russell had it
115-113, both in favor of Mosley. Marty Sammon scored it a curious
115-113 in favor of De La Hoya. The Daily News had 116-112 Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley, the victory gives him the WBC welterweight
championship awarded to De La Hoya when Felix Trinidad vacated the
title. And it removes any doubt as to his place in the boxing
world: A great champion was born this night.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed all the things associated with such a fighter
</P>
<P>
   skill, speed, power and tremendous courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was still very much in doubt going into the final
three rounds, a time when great fighters find a way to win. And it
was a fiercely determined Mosley (35-0, with 32 knockouts) who had
more to offer when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mosley appeared to be ahead, he stood toe-to-toe with
De La Hoya in an unforgettable - and one-sided - 12th round that
clinched the victory and punctuated a fabulous performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I took my career to another level tonight,'' a beaming
Mosley said and no one would argue.
</P>
<P>
   For De La Hoya, this hurts. The Golden Boy, once the king of his
sport in many respects, has lost his last two big fights. He also
was outpointed by Trinidad in September, a highly criticized
performance in which he ran the final three rounds to lose a fight
he was winning.
</P>
<P>
   If he had an aura of invincibility, it's long gone and we're
left to wonder whether he'll ever again rise to the top of the
boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   However, this most likely isn't the end for at least two
reasons: the !ital!way!off! he lost and the fact Mosley is expected
to give him an immediate rematch.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times in recent years, De La Hoya (32-2, 26
KOs) did exactly what he said he'd do - go after Mosley throughout
the fight even if it meant risking his own well being.
</P>
<P>
   He absorbed considerable punishment as a result of his strategy,
mostly quick, straight right hands that rocked but never seriously
hurt him. Even when it became apparent that he was a beaten man, De
La Hoya kept coming. Those who have doubted his courage will have
to admit that.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch? Mosley said emphatically before the fight that
there would be one because De La Hoya had given him a tremendous
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed the first installment would be thrilled if
it actually happens. They got their money's worth in the first
truly big fight in Los Angeles in a generation, one of the better
fights in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Mosley said when asked if there would be a
rematch. ``A fight that close, there has to be. We showed there are
two great champions from California.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, his right eye bruised and puffy, was diplomatic
immediately after the fight, congratulating Mosley and seemingly
accepting the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   However, at a news conference 1 hours after the bout, he seemed
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed he won a close fight and strongly implied
that he was a victim of a calculated decision to give the Mosley
the victory so others could make money from a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say the fight was fixed but said ``things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested he might retire but admitted he'll think about his
next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business,'' he said. ``People want a rematch. ... If
they give me a decision, there's no (second) fight. ... It's tough
to live with what goes on around boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can't continue on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, at the same time, he tried to give Mosley his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from Shane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, De La Hoya, who had predicted he would knock out each of
his four opponents in 2000, executed his prefight strategy from the
beginning: He stalked Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mosley, the quickest fighter De La Hoya has seen, coped
wonderfully. Like a cunning cat, he repeatedly pounced in, did his
damage with body shots and the rights, and then quickly moved out
of harm's way to admire his work.
</P>
<P>
   He also confused De La Hoya by switching to a left-handed stance
on several occasions, a testament to his ring acumen.
</P>
<P>
   And when Mosley was in punching range, De La Hoya somehow was
unable land clean, telling shots consistently. Mosley, rarely in
the wrong place at the wrong time, was much better defensively than
many had believed.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley also removed any doubt about his strength. Many believed
De La Hoya would be too strong for the challenger because Mosley
had recently moved from 135 pounds to 147, De La Hoya's weight
class the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   However, this was never evident. He took many good shots and
while he couldn't put De La Hoya down or out, it was his punches
that did the most significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive was Mosley's determination.
</P>
<P>
   In those final three rounds, the ``championship'' rounds, it was
Mosley, not the supposedly stronger De La Hoya, who looked fresher,
stronger and more confident.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley won two of the final three rounds on two cards and all
three on the third to win the fight and the hearts of all those who
witnessed his performance.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-De La Hoya crowd, which booed Mosley as he entered the
ring, could only admire him as he left it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I was stronger at 147,'' Mosley said. ``He hit me
with good, crisp shots but never dazed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I showed the world in the 12th round what kind of fighter
I am by standing in front of him and, win, lose or draw, fighting
like a warrior.''

 &HT;    73-year-old fiddle player proves it's never too late to follow a
dream
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   May 6, 1997
</P>
<P>
   Dear Professor:
</P>
<P>
   My name is George Nance. I am 70 years old. Can you teach me to
play the fiddle?
</P>
<P>
   That's how George F. Nance started a letter to a local music
professor whom he'd hoped would help fulfill a lifelong dream _ to
be able to strum out his favorite melodies on the fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   When Nance was a child in the 1930s, he didn't just want to play
the fiddle. He wanted to entertain with the fiddle. He would study
and idolize the long-haired fiddlers performing between acts of
plays at his elementary school, the New Olive School, just outside
Oglesby, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to at least play some kind of musical instrument,''
he said, ``because the voice is the language of the body, but music
is the language of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   But finances were tight for his farmer-parents. They couldn't
afford to buy a 19-cent harmonica, much less a fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   So his dream would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 17, instead of trying to graduate from high
school, I was working on the railroad in Roscoe. With my first
paycheck, I went to a pawn shop and bought a Stradivarius. Under
mother's bed, being the safest place in the house, I put it there.
One week later, the house burned down.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was ruled arson, he said. He's been told the $15 violin
that went up in smoke would be worth $30,000 now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it then, but that's kinda disheartening
now,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he joined the Army and was sent to Germany to rebuild
railroads destroyed in World War II. While he was there, he
listened to violinists on the radio and attended professional
concerts, still dreaming of making music himself.
</P>
<P>
   But after the war, he brought home a German bride, reared two
children and worked as a postman for the city of Waco. He became
busy with activities at the Masonic Lodge, and then came grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife died and he married again, to Louise, who says
she never let her own kids take music lessons because she didn't
want the noise in the house.
</P>
<P>
   As Nance got older, he suffered heart attacks and underwent
by-pass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   So his dream would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I went to another pawn shop and bought a Yosef Lidle
fiddle, hand-crafted by Cremona, in Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   I must tell you I cannot read music. I can't tell a melody from
a malady. I can't tell a C-note from a hundred dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   In holding the fiddle in the prescribed or usual manner, my
fingers are at constant odds over which one gets to push down the
next string. While the right hand draws the bow across the strings,
it emits sounds that would put a hyena to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Age, more than anything, made Nance drive to Waco Pawn Shop and
buy a $150-fiddle three years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting up to be 70, and, well, I just realized most of
my time had come and gone, and if I'm gonna do anything, I'd better
do it today 'cause tomorrow would be too late. I don't have the
agility of an 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance said he never thought he had any musical ability. He
thought the only ``instrument'' he could play was the radio.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I just always had a real strong desire to play
the fiddle.''
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years, he finally had another fiddle. The next step
would be finding a teacher so he could finally play it.
</P>
<P>
   But his dream would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot teach me, please put me in touch with someone who
can. I would love to play like Johnny Gimble, but you and I both
know that's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting your response, I remain, George F. Nance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as of this day, I must say I have not heard a word back
from him,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
   So he started teaching himself. A note here, a note there, until
his wife saw a notice in the newspaper about a ``jam session'' at
Lacy-Lakeview Community Center about a year-and-a-half ago. There
he met Johnny Bradshaw, who agreed to take him on as a pupil.
</P>
<P>
   He learns melodies by taping the notes to the fiddle. The notes
on the strings spell the word ``AGED,'' Nance chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to practice two hours a day, but most days he just does
as much as he can, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can play a few notes that sound good, I just add to it
some more that may not sound so good,'' he said. ``It's like
building a building. Just a few blocks at a time and eventually
you'll get the thing finished.''
</P>
<P>
   He now has a repertoire of more than 15 melodies _ mostly old
hymn tunes he recognizes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside his notebook of tunes is taped a saying he said gives him
inspiration: ``No matter what you achieve in life, it takes a lot
less work to be a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance still can't read music, and his fingers, wrinkled and
spotted with age, don't move as quickly as they would if he were
younger. But he prefers his method of playing by heart.
</P>
<P>
   He said playing the fiddle has been good for his heart, too. He
hasn't had any serious health problems since he started playing
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this feeds my soul,'' he said. ``It gives me
strength and inspires me to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone else who might feel it's too late to fulfill a
lifelong dream, Nance said to start before it's too late. Then be
willing to have patience, take time and be persistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start now,'' he said. ``Don't worry about money or anything.
Do what you can in your own way. Do not put it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance pulls his fiddle and bow out of the case and rests it on
his left shoulder, below the patches of silver hair that peek out
of his ``1 Grandpa'' baseball cap. He announces he's going to play
``Rubber Dolly,'' a song he used to sing on the schoolbus when he
was young.
</P>
<P>
   As he starts to strum out the tinny melody, he taps the toe of
his worn-out left brown boot, which is hardly visible underneath
his oversized denim OshKosh overalls. It's easy to imagine him
playing the tune as a child, as if he hadn't had to wait until he
was 73 to fulfill his dream of playing the fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   After he's done, Louise Nance sits down in a chair across from
him in the living room and looks at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may never play in Carnegie Hall,'' she says. ``But he sure
does like this.''

 &HT;    World's greatest free-throw shooter
 &HT;    By Dwayne Bray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dr. Tom Amberry, a 77-year-old retired California
podiatrist, woke up Thursday morning, headed to a local gym and
promptly knocked down 496 of 500 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not for this good doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad day,'' he grouses by phone from his Long Beach,
Calif., home. ``Yesterday, I was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Amberry is known as ``the world's greatest free-throw shooter.''
In 1993, he shot his way into the ``Guinness Book of Records'' by
sinking 2,750 straight free throws. In 1996, he co-authored the
book ``Free Throw: 7 Steps to Success at the Free Throw Line''
(HarperPerennial, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   With those credentials, he prefers to talk about the four misses
rather than the 496 conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sinking them and the minute you start to thinking you're
in trouble, you are,'' he says. ``I was thinking about things not
pertaining to what I was doing. Like my wife gave me orders to go
get her some baby spinach and some zucchini. That's how I missed
those four shots.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mental game, free-throw shooting is.
</P>
<P>
   That's the world's most-decorated free-throw shooter's message
to Los Angeles Lakers he-man center Shaquille O'Neal, the world's
most dominant basketball player who has a knack for misfiring from
the 15-foot stripe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal bricked 48 percent of his shots from the charity stripe
during the regular season. Compare that to the stats of other
all-star big men: San Antonio's David Robinson (72.6 percent), New
York's Patrick Ewing (73 percent), Minnesota's Kevin Garnett (76.5
percent) and the Spurs' Tim Duncan (76 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In Games 2 and 3 of the NBA finals, Shaq missed an incredible 31
of 52 freebies, and his feebleness at the line has become a major
story line in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer at the pro summer league in Long Beach, Amberry awed
players, coaches and executives of NBA teams with a foul-shooting
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attempted 50 shots, and I made 50,'' he says. ``The Lakers
and Celtics and all their front office personnel and their coaches
, including (Lakers coach Phil) Jackson, were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olden Polynice (Utah Jazz, 31 percent free-throw shooter)
said, 'Doc, I sure would love to be able to shoot free throws like
you.' But he never asked me to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice is not alone. Millionaire NBA stars aren't willing to
set aside their pride and allow a graying foot doctor to teach them
how to put the ball in the net. A few even mock Amberry, contending
it's easy to sink free throws in a non-game situation. But to hit
2,750 of them?
</P>
<P>
   Amberry has taught at clinics in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Australia.
And, says wife Helen, ``I don't think he's missed a state in the
U.S. He's been everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His prized pupil to date has been Kansas' center Eric Chenowith,
a 40 percent foul shooter in high school who finished last season
fourth best in the Big 12 with 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amberry says he could do the same for Shaq. But the Lakers
haven't come calling. He sighs, ``The Lakers know who I am. But I'm
not really in their loop. I'm not in the clique.''
</P>
<P>
   Amberry says O'Neal's problems are mostly mental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have him focus only on the shot,'' Amberry says. ``Putting
the ball in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Amberry suggests players square up at the line, bounce the ball
three times with the inflation hole facing up and hold the ball
with your thumb in the groove and your third finger pointing at the
inflation hole.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggest these mechanics: shooting elbow in, knees bent,
eyes on a target and good follow through.
</P>
<P>
   With Amberry's success, you would think NBA teams would be
knocking down this guy's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ego,'' Amberry says, ``is the drug of stupidity.''

 &HT;    Sedaris comes clean
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More funny essays by David Sedaris. What else do
you need to know?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an explanation of the title?
</P>
<P>
   ``Me Talk Pretty One Day,'' also an essay, is Sedaris'
approximation of how adult language students sounded in French
class. Sedaris attended such a class when he and his boyfriend,
Hugh, first moved to Paris two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit as funny as ``Naked,'' his 1997 book, this collection
describes Sedaris' IBM father, while the earlier one gave more
attention to his mother and grandmother. ``Me Talk Pretty One Day''
begins with deadpan essays about David's childhood speech therapy
and his guitar lessons taught by a midget, then moves on to
adulthood in New York and, eventually to Paris, where he still
lives. The humor relies on his offhand voice and the piling up of
the absurd details of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Sedaris talked to us by phone from Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You say you come back twice a year to lecture in theaters and
to our nation's young people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those are the appearances that work out the worst, talking to
our nation's young people. I do better talking to our nation's old
people. Talking to our nation's middle-aged people, I tend to do
much better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: People in college don't know who I am. Even when I'm in a
college town, the people who come aren't in college.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's the gap between you and today's young people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, gosh. I guess I never really thought about it. I'm 43.
I'm not young. I'm not hip. I'm not with it. I just try to write
about myself, and then people who are interested in what I have to
say about myself, you know, come.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think you'll stay in France?
</P>
<P>
   A: Um, yeah. I don't know how long. I Iike being a foreigner,
and I like not knowing what's going on. I like living with a
constant state of anxiety because it makes me feel more alive. I
tend to write better if I'm writing from a point of view where
people are giving me a hard time and where everything is a
struggle. . . . Well, I'm so set in my ways and so completely
resistant to changing anything because the world will fall apart if
I don't do my laundry on Sunday at 6 o'clock. If I do it at 7
o'clock, God knows what might happen. Or if I did it on Monday . .
. I can't take that chance. I've just really changed a lot since I
moved to France. Like I don't have glasses now . . . And sometimes
I do my laundry on a Tuesday. I've had so many changes in my
schedule and my environment that I think _ well, what if I made
even more? That might not sound very significant, but it's pretty
significant for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you working on now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have a play that's going to open in the fall. My sister and
I write plays together. So it's in the fall. Neither one of us has
any idea what it's about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You write about your father this time. Do you think you'll
ever exhaust your family as a subject?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think I have. So I've started in on my boyfriend's family .

   PART 2 of 5 PARTS
</P>
<P>
   HEARTLAND-OHIO _ Ohio has been fickle when picking presidents.
Since the Great Depression started in 1929, the state has supported
nine Republicans and seven Democrats. President Clinton won Ohio in
in both his bids for the White House, but in 1992 against George
Bush he won by only two percentage points. If it weren't for Ross
Perot, Clinton might have lost the state. The race in Ohio between
Vice President Gore, the Democrat, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
may be even closer. Both men need Ohio and its 21 electoral votes
as much, if not more, than any other state. No Republican has ever
captured the presidency without winning Ohio. And the Democrats
haven't won the Buckeye state in three consecutive elections since
Franklin Roosevelt did it in 1932, 1936 and 1940. (Wagner, Dayton
Daily News). 75.

   APPALACHIAN -CINEMA_ For the first time since the 1920s, this
Appalachian foothills town will have no movie theater this summer.
Town leaders meet Monday to consider a proposal by local developers
to reopen one of the town's two theaters which were closed in April
by Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike Cinemas. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.

   OPED/EDITORIAL
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ There was something about my husband
bending over the rain gauge after a recent sprinkle _ not enough
rain to call it a shower _ that reminded me of his dad. The only
difference in their anxious reactions during a drought is John
yells back at the Weather Channel, while W.T. Ezzard surely would

   GADGETS-COLUMN _ The newest wrinkle in movie sound systems is
Dolby Digital 6.1 Extended Surround, which requires seven speakers
to bring the movie theater sound experience home. Sherwood America,
a California-based home and car audio specialist, won an Innovation
Award at the International Consumer Electronics Show in January for

 &HT;    Getting ready for a summer trip
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Packing up your cares and woes is invariably
easier than packing for any trip. Ever since Adam loaded up his fig
leaves and half-eaten apple to hit the road, packing has been a
challenge. Think Moses wandered the desert for 40 years toting only
a backpack and shod in Tevas? Do you realize the astronauts are
allowed only 3 pounds of items in their PPKs (personal preference
kit) on a mission?
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to exotic locales does not mean going without one's
Lancome, orthopedic walking shoes, favorite jammies or the latest
best-seller. So travel has inspired the design of various carts,
barrels, trunks and suitcases to lug life's accoutrements.
</P>
<P>
   And now that wheels have been added to suitcases, even the
tiniest of travelers can drag a bag heavier than Jimmy Hoffa's
shoes onto an airline. The kitchen sink must be in some of those
bags. (My husband's rule: If you can't lift it into the overhead
bin alone, you should not be allowed to bring it on.)
</P>
<P>
   When packing, do you make sure every piece of clothing has at
least two uses? Appreciate that lace or silk underwear dries faster
than cotton? Know what interweaving a wardrobe means? Wonder what
to look for in good luggage? Daydream what you can buy besides a
loaded Jetta or PT Cruiser for $23,000?
</P>
<P>
   No?
</P>
<P>
   Then this edition of the Greig Files holds a few surprises.
Planning a trip? Read before you pack. Your clothes and your
traveling companions will thank you.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE FIRST RULE OF PACKING?
</P>
<P>
   Pack light. Followed closely by the second rule _ pack light.
</P>
<P>
   Packing light means freedom from tipping bell men, searching for
porters and making a fool of yourself as you compete for space on
trains and planes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most seasoned traveler will reduce the load after this
travel test. Pack your bags and carry them around the block (and up
a flight of stairs if possible). Return home. I guarantee that you
will find it easy to toss a few things back in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE DO I START?
</P>
<P>
   Make a list and designate a place to pack (dining room table,
bed, couch). Make sure both the luggage and clothes are clean
before you pack. Lay out the items on the list. Limit yourself to
what you need. For most people, this means one suitcase and one
carry-on bag. Remember, over-packing leaves no room for souvenirs
and strains luggage as well as backs.
</P>
<P>
   Carry-on items are those you cannot do without (toiletries,
itinerary, tickets, passport, medications). Some travelers add
anything needed to spend one night _ in case of car trouble or
flight delays. Simply grab the carry-on or daypack. No need to
disturb the main luggage containing clothing essentials and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ARE THERE DRUGSTORES ON BORA BORA?
</P>
<P>
   You bet. Wherever you are going _ barring the moon or Antarctica
_ supplies (socks to shampoo) are available. Why weigh yourself
down with ones from home? Some intrepid travelers pack a few almost
obsolete items (T-shirts or lingerie on its last legs) with the
intention of donating or ditching them along the way. Lightens the
load and creates an opportunity to make a local purchase _ batik
shirt, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, trains and airplanes offer basics such as mending kits
and mouthwash. Make the most of these freebies and leave the
20-ounce botanical face wash at home.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE A METHOD TO PACKING MADNESS?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Layer and roll.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the items on the ``to pack'' list? Place heavier things
such as shoes and appliances along the spine of the suitcase. Layer
the clothing beginning with the last day's outfit on the bottom and
continue upward to the first day's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Lay slacks horizontally across the suitcase. Turn jackets inside
out, folding arms inward before placing them vertically (collar
opposite the handle) in the suitcase. Interweave plastic bags (used
for wet items or dirty clothes) or tissue paper to reduce
wrinkling. Add rolled items (robes, shorts, skirts). After layering
clothing and accessories, fold the slacks legs and jacket bottoms
over the top of the stack in a weaving pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff shoes with socks, underwear and belts.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD BE ROLLED?
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything can be rolled for packing ease. Rolled clothing
has a good chance of arriving without wrinkles. Who wants to look
like an unmade bed on vacation?
</P>
<P>
   Lay skirts flat and fold sides inward to create a rectangle.
Roll from the hem to the waistband. Place a shirt face down on the
bed and fold sleeves inward. Roll from the shirttail to the collar,
ending with the collar on top.
</P>
<P>
   THINK EMPRESS EUGENIE REALIZED WHAT SHE STARTED?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. The empress, the love of Napoleon III's life, made
the career of the young Louis Vuitton. During France's Second
Empire, the women of the noblesse sought Vuitton for his talent _
building and packing custom trunks. When Vuitton was dubbed sole
trunkmaker to the Empress, he was able to open his own shop close
to Paris' Place Vendome.
</P>
<P>
   In this shop, Vuitton revolutionized packing by redesigning the
trunk. The traditional barrel-topped stagecoach trunk was flattened
by Vuitton. Voila! Several trunks could be stacked _ one on top of
the other_ allowing dukes and duchi to wander the globe with more
finery than ever. (How could Vuitton have known he simultaneously
provided every college student with a coffee table?)
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MAKES VUITTON'S LUGGAGE SO EXPENSIVE?
</P>
<P>
   Could be poplar wood used to construct the trunks (lightweight
and sturdy) or the signature monogram cotton canvas or the brass _
or gold-plated _ hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling piece of luggage? The Pegase, a carry-on for
$1,260. The most popular trunk? The Wardrobe, for a mere $19,100.
The Vuitton trunk containing a secretary (furniture, not person)
goes for $26,600.
</P>
<P>
   Even Imelda Marcos might balk at spending $22,900 for the
armoire trunk, designed to tote shoes from continent to continent.
The armoire holds about 1ned to Some Persons Which Have Transported
Themselves from England to Virginia'' _ sort of a ``Colonizing for
Dummies,'' if you will.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU HAVE ROOM . . .
</P>
<P>
   Card-size calculator (figure exchange rates and restaurant
bills)
</P>
<P>
   Flip-flops (shower shoes)
</P>
<P>
   Birthday candle or other small candle
</P>
<P>
   (fix zippers, light in a pinch)
</P>
<P>
   Rubber door stop (wedge under hotel room doors for added
security)
</P>
<P>
   Small folding scissors or pen knife
</P>
<P>
   (uses too numerous to mention)
</P>
<P>
   Moleskin (blister repair)
</P>
<P>
   Dryer sheets (suitcase deodorant also reduces static cling)
</P>
<P>
   Plastic sheet or large garbage bag (protects from bed bugs or
sudden rainstorms)
</P>
<P>
   Large envelopes (mail info home)
</P>
<P>
   Small flashlight (under pillow in case the electricity or your
spouse goes out)
</P>
<P>
   Plastic bags that seal
</P>
<P>
   (for wet laundry, bathing suits)
</P>
<P>
   Folding umbrella
</P>
<P>
   THAT WILL BE ALL, JEEVES
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell if your traveling companion has a butler from
the way a suitcase is packed? Is the woman's clean lingerie bundled
in white tissue and tied with a colorful ribbon for easy
identification? Have shoe heels been wrapped in protective tissue
or shoe bagsHas tissue paper been stuffed in suit jacket sleeves to
reduce wrinkling Are breakables swathed in bubble wrap?
</P>
<P>
   BAGGING THE PERFECT BAG
</P>
<P>
   Construction: Hard, semi-soft or soft-sided? Hard-sided luggage
protects contents and has the added security of built-in locks and
handles. Semi-soft cases are lighter and offer some impact
protection. Soft-sided cases are the most expandable and
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Leather exterior: Genuine leather (top made of all grain) is
durable, strong and made from the outermost layer of the animal
skin. Split leather is the underlayer split from the top grain.
Processed leather is one type of leather made to look like another,
such as faux alligator. Bonded or laminated leather is pulverized
scrap leather bonded with glue
</P>
<P>
   Fabric exterior: Nylon comes in a variety of thicknesses (known
as the denier). Durable, tight, construction nylon should be a
minimum of 400 denier or supported by a thicker material. Vinyl is
stain-resistant and often treated to look like leather. Molded
materials are poured into forms to make hard, seamless cases, which
may be covered with vinyl. Molded suitcases are very durable.
</P>
<P>
   Edges: Luggage protection and style are provided by edges which
may be turned (where materials meet is turned completely over all
edges), bound (separate material sewn completely over all edges),
welt (material sewn between seams and covers all edges) or
burnished (all edges cut off evenly and polished).
</P>
<P>
   Handles: The most durable handle is mounted with screws or
rivets to the suitcase frame or metal base and recessed for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware and accessories: Shoulder straps should be reinforced
and attached at stress points with protective padding. Zippers may
be metal molded or coil. The more screws or rivets used to mount a
lock, the more secure the lock. Check wheels for stability and
handling. Examine special features such as accordion side-pleats
for flexibility, outside pockets and wet packs.
</P>
<P>
   PACKING POINTERS
</P>
<P>
   Do not pack the same day you leave.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, leave it out.
</P>
<P>
   Never pack brand-new shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bring less; wash more often.
</P>
<P>
   Get a pedicure and pack sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Do not over or under pack _ your clothes will wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to wrinkle-resistant fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Bring clothes to layer and mix for warmth and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Unpack as soon as you arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Share items (who needs two hair dryers?!).
</P>
<P>
   Wear any jewelry you take (except costume) all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wear bulkier garments on travel days.
</P>
<P>
   Pack just one of anything _ except underwear and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Include your itinerary and a contact number (office, not home)
in case you and your bag are separated.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Surround sound is improving
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At first our home televisions and radios pumped
their sound through a single speaker. The speaker count jumped to
two for stereo, then four, and for the past couple years it's been
six speakers for 5.1 channel Dolby Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Now the latest is Dolby Digital 6.1 Extended Surround, which
requires seven speakers to bring the movie theater sound experience
home.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood America, a California-based home and car audio
specialist, won an Innovation Award at the International Consumer
Electronics Show in January for its design of the Newcastle R-956
receiver, which is capable of reproducing the 6.1 channel movie
theater sound environment at home.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby Digital 5.1 channel programming divides the soundtrack of
a movie into five surrounding channels plus a sixth channel to send
bass tones to a subwoofer.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical movies recorded in that format include ``Star Wars,''
``Episode One: The Phantom Menace;'' ``The Bone Collector;'' ``The
Haunting;'' ``End of Days'' and ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The R-956 has six 120-watt-per-channel discrete amplifiers to
drive its speakers. The receiver also features an on-screen
display, a dedicated audiovisual output to send signals to a home
theater in a second room and digital outputs for a compact disc or
mini disc recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver has not yet been shipped to audiovisual equipment
retailers, but within the next week you'll be able to order it
directly from Sherwood for $1,499.95. For additional information,
you can visit the Sherwood America Web site at
www.sherwoodamerica.com.
</P>
<P>
   To place an order, call (714) 870-5100 or e-mail
sales(at)sherwood
</P>
<P>
   usa.com.
</P>
<P>
   And the betting can start now on whether the next movie sound
wrinkle (Super Digital 8.2, perhaps?) will add speakers on the
ceiling or on the floor directly under each seat.

   LOS-ALAMOS-SECURITY (Los Alamos, N.M.) _ The government was
already facing hurdles in its efforts to prosecute a scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, but last week's disclosures that two hard drives filled
with highly sensitive weapons data had inexplicably vanished have
potentially made it far more difficult for prosecutors in what had
once been described as a major national security case. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has insisted from the time he was indicted
last year that security breaches at the laboratory are common, and
that the kind of downloading he did -- moving classified data, in
the open, from a secure to unsecured computer, then downloading it
to tapes -- was done frequently by other experts protecting data
from an unreliable computer system. 1500 words. By James Sterngold.

   VT-HEALTH-BENEFITS (Cowtown, Vt.) _ With health insurance for
nearly all children and prescription drug coverage for many people
on Medicare, Vermont is in the vanguard in terms of providing
medical benefits. The array of health benefits Vermont affords its
citizens _ not just the elderly but also children and low-income
adults _ is unmatched by any other state. And while many of
Vermont's programs would not work in larger, more urban, more
racially and ethnically diverse states, other aspects could serve
as a pattern elsewhere. Today, 93.5 percent of all Vermonters have
health insurance, including essentially all children. By contrast,
only 63 percent of low-income children in Texas and 60 percent in
Arizona are insured. What it all means, based on interviews with
the governor, doctors and ordinary folks who depend on the
benefits. 1200 words. By David E. Rosenbaum.

   CULT-KIDS (Island Pond, Vt.) _ In June 1984, state police raided
a cult called the Northeast Kingdom Community Church and rounded up
all the children to examine them for evidence of child abuse.
Stories about the alleged abuse were rampant at the time. A judge
disallowed the raid and the examinations, but the case made a big
splash nationally. The children who were rounded up in the raid
will hold a `teach-in' on Sunday in the town beach in Island Pond.
The list of invited speakers includes both the children, some of
the key law-enforcement officials who conducted the raid, the man
who was commissioner of child-protective services at the time, and
presumably some of the church members. 900 words. By Sally Johnson.

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BIO-III (New Haven, Conn.) _ Born at the earliest fringe of
the baby boom, Bush was pressed during his years at Yale to take
sides in the great battles then unfolding over politics, civil
rights, drugs and music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those
upheavals, but when forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the
values and ideals established by his parents' generation. Unlike
others of his generation, like Clinton or Gore, Bush never wore his
hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with existentialism or
cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his parents (instead of
hard rock music, he listened to soul). Even today, Bush thunders in
his stump speeches against boomer-style self-indulgence and appeals
for a ``responsibility era'' that in some respects sounds like the
1950s; he likes values as clean-cut as his hair. 4000 words. By
Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-VP (Austin, Texas) _ With little more than a month to go
before Gov. George W. Bush, the de facto Republican presidential
nominee, settles on the person with whom he wants to share the
ticket, the list of possibilities seems to be getting shorter. But
that does not mean it is getting a whole lot clearer, because Bush
is holding his cards so close to the vest that even his most
trusted advisers insist they have not been able to sneak a peek.
1150 words. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Washington) _ New details on Gore's Social Security
proposals emerge in a briefing; meantime, Bill Daley, Gore's new
campaign manager, goes on the Sunday talk show circuit to plant the
flag, something his predecessor, Tony Coelho, could not do because
he was afraid to be asked about his financial problems. 1000 words.
By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>

illustrates what is, in the view of some Democrats and Republicans
alike, Al Gore's surprisingly tough struggle to get out a message

call Coverdell. It is one reason he ascended into the Senate
Republican leadership so quickly, as a mere freshman. By Lizette

 &HT;    Arm of the law stops at branch of tree
 &HT;    By Brett Thurman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hope you can answer my question. Our neighbor's tree has
branches that grow into our yard, and into a pine tree growing in
our yard. It dumps leaves and branches we have to clean up. We are
an older couple, so the branches are too high for us to clip off by
ourselves. We have talked to these neighbors several times about
this problem but they refuse to do anything about it. Is there
anything we can do to make them clip these branches off?
</P>
<P>
   A: When your Realtor told you these neighbors would ``grow on
you,'' this isn't what you had hoped for, was it?
</P>
<P>
   Before we branch into more bad puns that will only leaf you
hanging from a limb, let's go over some basics of what might be
called ``neighbor law.''
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of issues that can arise from neighbors
owning property adjoining or near to one another. The issues very
generally can be classified according to whether the neighbors
themselves are the active agent in making something move across
property boundaries, or whether Mother Nature is really to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Wind, water, and most growing things move naturally around in
nature without much regard to the property boundaries we humans
might draw. The law takes this into account. You can't usually hold
your neighbors responsible for such natural things.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, you might reasonably expect that your property
line will affect how your neighbors act. And the law will back you
up if the parties next door are too loud (and you are not invited),
their dog keeps chasing you into your house, etc. But it is
unreasonable for you to expect your property line to change how
Mother Nature acts.
</P>
<P>
   Even the law knows it is not nice to fool with Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Now this is very general advice. And there can be a world of
difference between a new, poisonous plant positioned a few inches
from the property line, and a 100-year- old oak whose 50-foot
branches hang 10 feet over.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, neighbors are expected to know trees sometimes
express shocking indifference to property lines when the chance
arises to spread its roots or branches, shed an old branch or drop
its leaves in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you get the benefit of some shade from a tree you don't
own, so can you be burdened with some leaf and branch removal from
that same tree. Just be glad its roots are not in your plumbing
(which also gives you little or no recourse against the tree's
``owner.'')
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time no court is going to make your neighbors do any
branch removal they do not wish to do. If the tree is dead and
presents a significant threat of damage from falling branches, then
under certain circumstances you can call the police or go to court
and force the hazard be abated. In obvious hazard situations, you
might even be able so sue for damages that might result.
</P>
<P>
   In most situations you are free to perform (or pay to have
performed) routine trimming and maintenance on overhanging
branches. But be careful. You could be liable to the tree's owners
if the maintenance performed is not approved by them and actually
results in damage to their tree or the value of their property
generally.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting with an experienced tree-trimming company is a good
idea on how proceed here before taking any action. They usually
know how to manage the issues that arise in these situations.

 &HT;    World's greatest free-throw shooter
 &HT;    By Dwayne Bray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dr. Tom Amberry, a 77-year-old retired California
podiatrist, woke up Thursday morning, headed to a local gym and
promptly knocked down 496 of 500 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not for this good doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad day,'' he grouses by phone from his Long Beach,
Calif., home. ``Yesterday, I was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Amberry is known as ``the world's greatest free-throw shooter.''
In 1993, he shot his way into the ``Guinness Book of Records'' by
sinking 2,750 straight free throws. In 1996, he co-authored the
book ``Free Throw: 7 Steps to Success at the Free Throw Line''
(HarperPerennial, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   With those credentials, he prefers to talk about the four misses
rather than the 496 conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sinking them and the minute you start to thinking you're
in trouble, you are,'' he says. ``I was thinking about things not
pertaining to what I was doing. Like my wife gave me orders to go
get her some baby spinach and some zucchini. That's how I missed
those four shots.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mental game, free-throw shooting is.
</P>
<P>
   That's the world's most-decorated free-throw shooter's message
to Los Angeles Lakers he-man center Shaquille O'Neal, the world's
most dominant basketball player who has a knack for misfiring from
the 15-foot stripe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal bricked 48 percent of his shots from the charity stripe
during the regular season. Compare that to the stats of other
all-star big men: San Antonio's David Robinson (72.6 percent), New
York's Patrick Ewing (73 percent), Minnesota's Kevin Garnett (76.5
percent) and the Spurs' Tim Duncan (76 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In Games 2 and 3 of the NBA finals, Shaq missed an incredible 31
of 52 freebies, and his feebleness at the line has become a major
story line in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer at the pro summer league in Long Beach, Amberry awed
players, coaches and executives of NBA teams with a foul-shooting
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attempted 50 shots, and I made 50,'' he says. ``The Lakers
and Celtics and all their front office personnel and their coaches
, including (Lakers coach Phil) Jackson, were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olden Polynice (Utah Jazz, 31 percent free-throw shooter)
said, 'Doc, I sure would love to be able to shoot free throws like
you.' But he never asked me to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice is not alone. Millionaire NBA stars aren't willing to
set aside their pride and allow a graying foot doctor to teach them
how to put the ball in the net. A few even mock Amberry, contending
it's easy to sink free throws in a non-game situation. But to hit
2,750 of them?
</P>
<P>
   Amberry has taught at clinics in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Australia.
And, says wife Helen, ``I don't think he's missed a state in the
U.S. He's been everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His prized pupil to date has been Kansas' center Eric Chenowith,
a 40 percent foul shooter in high school who finished last season
fourth best in the Big 12 with 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amberry says he could do the same for Shaq. But the Lakers
haven't come calling. He sighs, ``The Lakers know who I am. But I'm
not really in their loop. I'm not in the clique.''
</P>
<P>
   Amberry says O'Neal's problems are mostly mental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have him focus only on the shot,'' Amberry says. ``Putting
the ball in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Amberry suggests players square up at the line, bounce the ball
three times with the inflation hole facing up and hold the ball
with your thumb in the groove and your third finger pointing at the
inflation hole.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggest these mechanics: shooting elbow in, knees bent,
eyes on a target and good follow through.
</P>
<P>
   With Amberry's success, you would think NBA teams would be
knocking down this guy's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ego,'' Amberry says, ``is the drug of stupidity.''

 &HT;    Everything riding on this one
 &HT;    By Dave George

<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, N.J. _ The 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials for show jumping
begin Wednesday at a beautifully manicured equestrian center in New
Jersey, but that is far too tight a focus for a story on Margie
Goldstein Engle. Her personal Olympic trials, and tribulations too,
began eight years ago with a quirky injury to a trusted teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Even now Engle displays the name of that teammate on the
personalized Florida license plate of her car, a red Cadillac
dusted white by the dirt roads of Wellington's horse country.
Saluut II is the name, and their partnership as rider and Grand
Prix mount seemed destined for a shot at Olympic gold at the 1992
Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great horse,'' said Engle, five times the American
Grandprix Association rider of the year, ``but I've learned that
there are a lot of things you can't control in this sport. Your
horse could step on something in training or get an abscess or go
colicky on you. We've got chiropractors for the animals and
acupuncturists and ultrasound and magnetic blankets and massage
therapy, but still you can do everything right and have it come out
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Saluut II, living out a luxurious retirement in
Maryland these days, it was an injury sustained in what can only be
described here as a breeding accident. Four years later, while
Engle was leading the early stages of the Olympic team selection
process, her best horse, Caribbean Queen, got hurt while being
transported in a van.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there was that other little accident, the one Engle
doesn't bring up herself because it involved her own physical
problems rather than those of her beloved horses. In 1992 she broke
several ribs and had a deep gash torn in her back by a mount that
fell during a competition and got tangled up in a fence trying to
regain its feet. At 104 pounds, Engle doesn't stand much of a
chance when something unexpected causes a 1,200-pound animal to
lose its regal Grand Prix bearing and leap into a royal panic.
</P>
<P>
   TRIALS PROCESS CAN BE TRYING
</P>
<P>
   Engle, 41, may get several more shots at representing the U.S.
at the Olympics, as winter Wellington resident Norman Dello Joio
did with a bronze-medal performance at the 1992 Barcelona Games.
One unsabotaged run through the six-week selection process this
summer would be an important victory in itself, however. About 90
horses are qualified to begin the trials Wednesday at Gladstone,
N.J. In the course of five days the field will be whittled to 12
horses, a group by August will yield four Olympic horse-rider
combinations and one alternate following a series of further
competitions in California.
</P>
<P>
   Riders may enter more than one horse and gain a place in the
points standings on each of them. For that reason, Engle may go the
trials with as many as five horses, a numerical advantage in terms
of qualifying chances but not, in her mind, the most desirable
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have one really top horse,'' she said, ``than
four that are about equal. You could have a situation where you
have a clean run every day of the competition but still don't
qualify because you did it on a different horse each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidden Creek's Perin, a young horse newly acquired by
Wellington's Michael Polaski for Engle to ride, might be the best
choice, but only if Engle feels totally comfortable with the
communication between them. Hidden Creek's Alvaretto is a safer
choice and a steady competitor but may not be able to match Perin's
raw power on the jumps. When the challenge is to clear 15-20
obstacles without a touch, some nearly 6 feet tall, athletic
ability cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   LIVES HERE YEAR-ROUND
</P>
<P>
   Engle, a Wellington resident for 10 years and a product of Dade
County's public school system, is a rarity among elite show jumpers
in that she keeps her year-round headquarters in South Florida
rather than leaving at the end of the winter equestrian season. The
business degree she earned at Florida International University
helps in the running of Gladewind Farms, its 30-stall stable and a
staff of 14 trainers. Margie's father, Irvin Goldstein, a retired
CPA, does the books. Husband Steve Engle, a veterinarian who
originally met Margie at a horse show, is readily available for
consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a team, but in the end it all comes down to Engle's
ability to steer a horse faultlessly through a virtual minefield as
a running scoreboard clock demands brevity and bravery in equal
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Few thrive in this environment. Engle lives for it. She's been
living for it since elementary school, when a classmate invited her
to a riding party. Margie loved it so much at the horse barn that
she begged to return, earning permission to do odd jobs, riding a
bus home at the end of the day when carpool rides fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was laughing the other day,'' Engle said, ``because she
remembered the day I called home all excited to tell her that I got
to muck out the horses' stalls. All I wanted was to be around the
horses. The trainers used to kid me that I would ride a donkey if
they'd let me. I actually never owned my own horse until my early
20s.''
</P>
<P>
   That little girl's dream could reach its fullest expression at
Sydney this September, but only if she makes it through the U.S.
trials. Finally.

consolidating into three mega-carriers in America (and an equal

mergers would create coast-to-coast airlines offering more
destinations and more competition than any of the six major
American airlines. But studies of individual airports have shown
that fares increase when the number of airlines serving an airport
decreases. Now, with customer complaints at an all-time high, and

 &HT;    Ohioans know how fish feel
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Harry Ruzicka's quiet morning on a pier in
Sandusky Bay is interrupted by a tug on his fishing line and the
thought of giving his vote to Al Gore or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ruzicka, struggling a bit to land a big sheephead, struggles
even more over who he wants to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush comes from a good family, but I think he'll ruin Social
Security and do nothing to make health care better,'' Ruzicka said.
``Gore will do more for the average guy, but he'll have us paying
more taxes and he's as real as my $3 bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picking a president is about like what I'm doing with these
fish, trying to figure out which one to keep and which one to toss
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruzicka is 89, a lifelong independent and the kind of guy who
liked Harry Truman because he wasn't afraid to curse on the radio.
He has voted for 18 presidents, some Democrat, some Republican, and
this year he isn't sure which way to cast.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio voters like Ruzicka are the real prize catch of campaign
2000. They bring with them 21 electoral votes and are the reason
Vice President Gore, the Democrat, and Texas Gov. Bush, the
Republican, will continue barnstorming the state over the next five
months.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do early polls show the race getting closer, history
shows Buckeye voters are as fickle as the fish in Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1932, the first presidential election of the Great
Depression, Ohio has voted Republican nine times, and Democratic
seven. President Clinton took Ohio twice, but in 1992 against
incumbent George Bush, he won by only 2 percentage points. If not
for third-party candidate Ross Perot, Clinton might have lost Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fight for the White House could be even closer.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has ever captured the presidency without winning
Ohio. And the Democrats haven't won the Buckeye State in three
consecutive elections since Franklin Roosevelt did it in 1932, '36
and '40.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't paying attention right now. It's summer, we
haven't gotten to the conventions,'' said Allan Lichtman, chairman
of American University's Department of History. ``But both Bush and
Gore are paying a lot of attention to Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with more than 100 likely voters across Ohio found
few beyond the fiercely partisan who have already made up their
minds. Ohioans are more likely to say the Reds or the Indians _ not
Bush or Gore _ when asked who will win this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have concerns the candidates can speak to. Tax cuts,
health care, gun issues, abortion rights and deteriorating schools
all were repeatedly mentioned, with one issue, character, cutting
across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my children thinking it's OK to lie or deceive
people,'' said Kelly Vincent, a single mother of two and lab
technician from Dayton. ``I don't care too much about their
politics or what party they are from, I just want a decent man to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't have to be perfect, but he should
respect the people who elected him.''
</P>
<P>
   OHIO CONSIDERED NATIONAL BELLWETHER
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is the nation's seventh most populous state and one of its
most culturally diverse. It still has a strong agriculture and
manufacturing base, along with a growing technology sector and some
of the nation's best medical facilities and universities.
</P>
<P>
   It leans slightly Republican, but neither party can take it for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has long been considered a national bellwether, and for
good reason. In the last century, Ohio voted the same way the
nation voted in 23 of 25 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Republican rule of thumb for winning in Ohio
involved heavily Democratic Cuyahoga County _ but it did not
include winning there. Republicans just had to lose there by fewer
than 100,000 votes, a margin that could be offset by Republican
areas elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Republicans say gains in other metro regions,
including Dayton, mean the 100,000-vote threshold no longer
matters. They can get creamed in Cuyahoga County, according to the
new Republican math, and still carry the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lot more votes to get now in places like Dayton and
Columbus,'' said Ohio Republican Chairman Robert Bennett. ``It's
not all about Cleveland any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County politics illustrate the point. Once
significantly blue collar and solidly Democratic, the county now is
politically balanced, a Republican vote having grown with suburban
development.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, claim new inroads as well, and cite Columbus
Mayor Michael Coleman, the city's first Democratic mayor in 28
years, to prove their point.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft said Ohio voters have become much less
predictable. ``I think the electorate is more volatile and less
historic in its allegiance to either party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Dimora, the Cuyahoga County Democratic chairman and a
county commissioner, knows he's in for a tougher fight this year.
Bush is striking a chord with some traditional Democratic voters,
Dimora said. And he wishes Gore would take it more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore spent nothing here (for the primary). That concerns me
that they are taking this county for granted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, doesn't
share Dimora's concerns. Leland says Gore and the Democrats won't
take Cuyahoga County or any other area for granted when the
campaign gets rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win this state and win this election by not conceding any
area,'' Leland said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats won't carry Republican Hamilton County, he said, ``but
we might be able to pick up 5,000 votes there. That's the kind of
effort it will take to win a close race like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cuyahoga County holds a big key for Ohio Democrats, then the
key to the county, Dimora said, is solidifying the vote in
Cleveland and getting out early and often to the more ethnic,
inner-ring suburbs such as Parma, Lakewood and Euclid.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six-year-old Helen McFarland of Brookpark, another of
the blue-collar suburbs, is typical of voters found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived during the Hoover depression and my Dad pounded it
into our heads,'' McFarland said. ``We almost lost our home. We
went to school with cardboard in our shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad's message: Republicans take care of the rich; everyone else
needs the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland backs Gore for the simple reason he is not Bush.
</P>
<P>
   MANY VOTES IN THE MIDDLE
</P>
<P>
   If McFarland were typical of Ohio voters, there would be no race
here. But Ohio is filled with swing voters who inhabit the
political middle, which is where the presidential fight will really
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Ohioans like Tim Williams, Israel Morales and Charles Buckley
represent Taft's less predictable electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 49, is an assembly line worker at Ford Motor Co.'s
massive engine plant in northeastern Ohio. He voted for Clinton
twice and has considered himself a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, he said, ``(My vote) is still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't followed either candidate right now because
when you get down to it, there isn't much difference between the
Democrats and the Republicans,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bennett, a political scientist from University of
Cincinnati, said both Bush and Gore are trying to convince Ohio's
moderate and swing voters that they are one of them. Bush is trying
to shake off the conservative image he created to beat Arizona Sen.
John McCain in the primaries; Gore is seen by many as a liberal
environmental and labor union activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing extreme in the Midwest is the extreme middle,''
Bennett said. ``Most people in the Midwest tend to be very moderate
and so these candidates are trying to be what these people want.
Bush has done a better job of getting to these people so far.''
</P>
<P>
   When campaigning in Ohio, Bush has conspicuously gone to urban,
traditionally Democratic neighborhoods, including two Hispanic
areas on Cleveland's west side.
</P>
<P>
   In Clark-Fulton, a historically Italian neighborhood now seeing
an influx of Latinos, Israel Morales has voted for Democrats in
every presidential election except 1988. That year, he backed
Bush's father, former President George W. Bush, and this year he
likes Bush the son.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) addresses Hispanic issues more,'' said Morales, 48, a
truck driver who was born in Puerto Rico but has lived in the
United States for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include Bush's position in the custody fight over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Bush criticized the government's armed
intervention to remove Elian from Miami relatives and reunite him
with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Downstate in the Perry County seat of New Lexington, a town of
5,100 on the edge of the Wayne National Forest, it would be
inaccurate to call Charles Buckley a swing voter. But he is someone
who's less comfortable than he once was with the party of his
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 73, is in the midst of a personal transition.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported Republican candidates with his time and money
for years. He crankily calls the ACLU the American Communist
Lawyers Union. He doubts he would vote for Al Gore if Gore ran
unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the fund-raising letters from Republican
politicians all over the nation started to weigh on his mind. They
came in from California, Kansas, Wisconsin . . . he stopped
counting at 280 letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My postman said 'You're kind of popular,' `` Buckley said. ``I
said, no, they just want a piece of the pie, and I'm the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley feels stuck with Bush. He has seen politicians preach a
welcome, conservative message, then do little to advance it once in
office. They do whatever they need to preserve their jobs, then do
what is necessary to take care of their party, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, if there's anything left, you take care of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH A SHOO-IN IN ALLEN COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ohl of Lima, a conservative voter in what may be the
state's most conservative county, shares no such ambivalence this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ohl, 39, a mother of three, is among the best women
sharpshooters in the nation, and this day she's at the Lima Sabres
Shooting Club, exercising her M-16.
</P>
<P>
   At 200 yards, she doesn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   Ohl despises gun control. She wants to have the country's first
Girl Scouts who earn their rifle shooting merit badge, just like
the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, she and other Allen County residents took
aim at Gov. Taft's safe storage gun bill. Statehouse offices were
flooded with phone calls and letters from the Lima area, more than
from any other single region, to protest the bill, which died in
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a cinch to carry this northwest Ohio county which last
voted for a Democratic presidential candidate when it choose Harry
Truman in 1948. The only way Bush could lose support here is if he
doesn't stop to visit (every Republican presidential candidate
since Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 has stopped in Lima) or if he
changes his position on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, they have the right to carry and conceal, the right
to protect themselves and their families, Bush will push to give
all Americans that same right,'' Ohl said. ``My rights as a gun
owner, the constitutional right I cherish most, would be stripped
away by Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohioans list education as their top issue on polls. In
interviews, other issues also emerge, including tax cuts, health
care and abortion rights, with different regions emphasizing
different topics.
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, gun control and abortion rights are hot. In Democratic
Youngstown, it's organized labor and foreign trade. Around
Columbus, voters talk about the economy and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money for me. Are they going to give some back
to us or are they going keep taking what I make?'' asked Kenneth
Broughman, a Republican banker and father of three from Dublin, a
northwest suburb of Columbus. ``I know the schools are in bad
shape, but when were they ever in good shape? If we don't get some
tax relief now when times are good, we may never get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere is a single issue more important than in
southeastern Ohio's Perry County, a former coal-mining area that's
hit hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Residents there have seen overcrowded school buildings continue
to crumble while state lawmakers and the Ohio Supreme Court fight
over how Ohio should pay for public education. The lawsuit that led
to Ohio's funding system declared unconstitutional started here, in
the Northern Local School District.
</P>
<P>
   An odd conglomeration of buildings, trailers and temporary sheds
make up the district's high School, middle school and school board
offices. Everyone in the area knows someone who had to sit on the
floor in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember my daughter sitting on the floor of the
cafeteria to eat lunch,'' said Susan Miller, 50, a legal secretary
from Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   Voters here _ retired truckers, barbers or legal secretaries _
know the responsibility for school lies with the state. But if Bush
or Gore could show a direct link between their proposals and
getting local kids off the floor during lunchtime, they would find
an attentive audience.
</P>
<P>
   FROM NOW UNTIL NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   A poll in May by the American Research Group showed Bush with a
6-point lead. But Democrats note Gore has been closing the gap in
polls. Last October, Bush's lead in the University of Cincinnati's
Ohio Poll was 24 points. In January it was 13, and more recently,
9.
</P>
<P>
   But its too early for poll numbers to mean much. Too many
political questions linger.
</P>
<P>
   How much impact will Gov. Taft have campaigning for Bush? Will
Columbus Mayor Coleman help Gore pick up support in a traditionally
conservative city? Will the criminal investigation of U.S. Rep.
James Traficant, D-Youngstown, hurt Gore in a Democratic
stronghold?
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is up for grabs, both parties know that and it has
both sides a little nervous heading into the real part of the
campaign season,'' said Staci Rhine, a political scientist from
Wittenberg University in Springfield. ``What happens with the
economy as far as interest rates, gas prices and the stock market
will also have an impact on voters between now and November.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the pier in Sandusky Bay, Harry Ruzicka thought about
what it would be like to go fishing with Gore and Bush. He said
Gore would probably talk too much and scare away the fish, and Bush
would probably drink all of his beer.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ruzicka got serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to make fun of guys running for that office, but one
of them is going to be president, for God's sake. One of them will
end up reeling me in, I just don't know which one yet.''

 &HT;    Ohioans know how fish feel
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Harry Ruzicka's quiet morning on a pier in
Sandusky Bay is interrupted by a tug on his fishing line and the
thought of giving his vote to Al Gore or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ruzicka, struggling a bit to land a big sheephead, struggles
even more over who he wants to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush comes from a good family, but I think he'll ruin Social
Security and do nothing to make health care better,'' Ruzicka said.
``Gore will do more for the average guy, but he'll have us paying
more taxes and he's as real as my $3 bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picking a president is about like what I'm doing with these
fish, trying to figure out which one to keep and which one to toss
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruzicka is 89, a lifelong independent and the kind of guy who
liked Harry Truman because he wasn't afraid to curse on the radio.
He has voted for 18 presidents, some Democrat, some Republican, and
this year he isn't sure which way to cast.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio voters like Ruzicka are the real prize catch of campaign
2000. They bring with them 21 electoral votes and are the reason
Vice President Gore, the Democrat, and Texas Gov. Bush, the
Republican, will continue barnstorming the state over the next five
months.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do early polls show the race getting closer, history
shows Buckeye voters are as fickle as the fish in Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1932, the first presidential election of the Great
Depression, Ohio has voted Republican nine times, and Democratic
seven. President Clinton took Ohio twice, but in 1992 against
incumbent George Bush, he won by only 2 percentage points. If not
for third-party candidate Ross Perot, Clinton might have lost Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fight for the White House could be even closer.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has ever captured the presidency without winning
Ohio. And the Democrats haven't won the Buckeye State in three
consecutive elections since Franklin Roosevelt did it in 1932, '36
and '40.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't paying attention right now. It's summer, we
haven't gotten to the conventions,'' said Allan Lichtman, chairman
of American University's Department of History. ``But both Bush and
Gore are paying a lot of attention to Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with more than 100 likely voters across Ohio found
few beyond the fiercely partisan who have already made up their
minds. Ohioans are more likely to say the Reds or the Indians _ not
Bush or Gore _ when asked who will win this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have concerns the candidates can speak to. Tax cuts,
health care, gun issues, abortion rights and deteriorating schools
all were repeatedly mentioned, with one issue, character, cutting
across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my children thinking it's OK to lie or deceive
people,'' said Kelly Vincent, a single mother of two and lab
technician from Dayton. ``I don't care too much about their
politics or what party they are from, I just want a decent man to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't have to be perfect, but he should
respect the people who elected him.''
</P>
<P>
   OHIO CONSIDERED NATIONAL BELLWETHER
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is the nation's seventh most populous state and one of its
most culturally diverse. It still has a strong agriculture and
manufacturing base, along with a growing technology sector and some
of the nation's best medical facilities and universities.
</P>
<P>
   It leans slightly Republican, but neither party can take it for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has long been considered a national bellwether, and for
good reason. In the last century, Ohio voted the same way the
nation voted in 23 of 25 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Republican rule of thumb for winning in Ohio
involved heavily Democratic Cuyahoga County _ but it did not
include winning there. Republicans just had to lose there by fewer
than 100,000 votes, a margin that could be offset by Republican
areas elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Republicans say gains in other metro regions,
including Dayton, mean the 100,000-vote threshold no longer
matters. They can get creamed in Cuyahoga County, according to the
new Republican math, and still carry the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lot more votes to get now in places like Dayton and
Columbus,'' said Ohio Republican Chairman Robert Bennett. ``It's
not all about Cleveland any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County politics illustrate the point. Once
significantly blue collar and solidly Democratic, the county now is
politically balanced, a Republican vote having grown with suburban
development.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, claim new inroads as well, and cite Columbus
Mayor Michael Coleman, the city's first Democratic mayor in 28
years, to prove their point.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft said Ohio voters have become much less
predictable. ``I think the electorate is more volatile and less
historic in its allegiance to either party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Dimora, the Cuyahoga County Democratic chairman and a
county commissioner, knows he's in for a tougher fight this year.
Bush is striking a chord with some traditional Democratic voters,
Dimora said. And he wishes Gore would take it more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore spent nothing here (for the primary). That concerns me
that they are taking this county for granted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, doesn't
share Dimora's concerns. Leland says Gore and the Democrats won't
take Cuyahoga County or any other area for granted when the
campaign gets rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win this state and win this election by not conceding any
area,'' Leland said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats won't carry Republican Hamilton County, he said, ``but
we might be able to pick up 5,000 votes there. That's the kind of
effort it will take to win a close race like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cuyahoga County holds a big key for Ohio Democrats, then the
key to the county, Dimora said, is solidifying the vote in
Cleveland and getting out early and often to the more ethnic,
inner-ring suburbs such as Parma, Lakewood and Euclid.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six-year-old Helen McFarland of Brookpark, another of
the blue-collar suburbs, is typical of voters found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived during the Hoover depression and my Dad pounded it
into our heads,'' McFarland said. ``We almost lost our home. We
went to school with cardboard in our shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad's message: Republicans take care of the rich; everyone else
needs the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland backs Gore for the simple reason he is not Bush.
</P>
<P>
   MANY VOTES IN THE MIDDLE
</P>
<P>
   If McFarland were typical of Ohio voters, there would be no race
here. But Ohio is filled with swing voters who inhabit the
political middle, which is where the presidential fight will really
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Ohioans like Tim Williams, Israel Morales and Charles Buckley
represent Taft's less predictable electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 49, is an assembly line worker at Ford Motor Co.'s
massive engine plant in northeastern Ohio. He voted for Clinton
twice and has considered himself a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, he said, ``(My vote) is still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't followed either candidate right now because
when you get down to it, there isn't much difference between the
Democrats and the Republicans,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bennett, a political scientist from University of
Cincinnati, said both Bush and Gore are trying to convince Ohio's
moderate and swing voters that they are one of them. Bush is trying
to shake off the conservative image he created to beat Arizona Sen.
John McCain in the primaries; Gore is seen by many as a liberal
environmental and labor union activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing extreme in the Midwest is the extreme middle,''
Bennett said. ``Most people in the Midwest tend to be very moderate
and so these candidates are trying to be what these people want.
Bush has done a better job of getting to these people so far.''
</P>
<P>
   When campaigning in Ohio, Bush has conspicuously gone to urban,
traditionally Democratic neighborhoods, including two Hispanic
areas on Cleveland's west side.
</P>
<P>
   In Clark-Fulton, a historically Italian neighborhood now seeing
an influx of Latinos, Israel Morales has voted for Democrats in
every presidential election except 1988. That year, he backed
Bush's father, former President George W. Bush, and this year he
likes Bush the son.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) addresses Hispanic issues more,'' said Morales, 48, a
truck driver who was born in Puerto Rico but has lived in the
United States for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include Bush's position in the custody fight over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Bush criticized the government's armed
intervention to remove Elian from Miami relatives and reunite him
with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Downstate in the Perry County seat of New Lexington, a town of
5,100 on the edge of the Wayne National Forest, it would be
inaccurate to call Charles Buckley a swing voter. But he is someone
who's less comfortable than he once was with the party of his
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 73, is in the midst of a personal transition.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported Republican candidates with his time and money
for years. He crankily calls the ACLU the American Communist
Lawyers Union. He doubts he would vote for Al Gore if Gore ran
unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the fund-raising letters from Republican
politicians all over the nation started to weigh on his mind. They
came in from California, Kansas, Wisconsin . . . he stopped
counting at 280 letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My postman said 'You're kind of popular,' `` Buckley said. ``I
said, no, they just want a piece of the pie, and I'm the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley feels stuck with Bush. He has seen politicians preach a
welcome, conservative message, then do little to advance it once in
office. They do whatever they need to preserve their jobs, then do
what is necessary to take care of their party, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, if there's anything left, you take care of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH A SHOO-IN IN ALLEN COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ohl of Lima, a conservative voter in what may be the
state's most conservative county, shares no such ambivalence this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ohl, 39, a mother of three, is among the best women
sharpshooters in the nation, and this day she's at the Lima Sabres
Shooting Club, exercising her M-16.
</P>
<P>
   At 200 yards, she doesn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   Ohl despises gun control. She wants to have the country's first
Girl Scouts who earn their rifle shooting merit badge, just like
the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, she and other Allen County residents took
aim at Gov. Taft's safe storage gun bill. Statehouse offices were
flooded with phone calls and letters from the Lima area, more than
from any other single region, to protest the bill, which died in
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a cinch to carry this northwest Ohio county which last
voted for a Democratic presidential candidate when it choose Harry
Truman in 1948. The only way Bush could lose support here is if he
doesn't stop to visit (every Republican presidential candidate
since Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 has stopped in Lima) or if he
changes his position on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, they have the right to carry and conceal, the right
to protect themselves and their families, Bush will push to give
all Americans that same right,'' Ohl said. ``My rights as a gun
owner, the constitutional right I cherish most, would be stripped
away by Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohioans list education as their top issue on polls. In
interviews, other issues also emerge, including tax cuts, health
care and abortion rights, with different regions emphasizing
different topics.
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, gun control and abortion rights are hot. In Democratic
Youngstown, it's organized labor and foreign trade. Around
Columbus, voters talk about the economy and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money for me. Are they going to give some back
to us or are they going keep taking what I make?'' asked Kenneth
Broughman, a Republican banker and father of three from Dublin, a
northwest suburb of Columbus. ``I know the schools are in bad
shape, but when were they ever in good shape? If we don't get some
tax relief now when times are good, we may never get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere is a single issue more important than in
southeastern Ohio's Perry County, a former coal-mining area that's
hit hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Residents there have seen overcrowded school buildings continue
to crumble while state lawmakers and the Ohio Supreme Court fight
over how Ohio should pay for public education. The lawsuit that led
to Ohio's funding system declared unconstitutional started here, in
the Northern Local School District.
</P>
<P>
   An odd conglomeration of buildings, trailers and temporary sheds
make up the district's high School, middle school and school board
offices. Everyone in the area knows someone who had to sit on the
floor in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember my daughter sitting on the floor of the
cafeteria to eat lunch,'' said Susan Miller, 50, a legal secretary
from Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   Voters here _ retired truckers, barbers or legal secretaries _
know the responsibility for school lies with the state. But if Bush
or Gore could show a direct link between their proposals and
getting local kids off the floor during lunchtime, they would find
an attentive audience.
</P>
<P>
   FROM NOW UNTIL NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   A poll in May by the American Research Group showed Bush with a
6-point lead. But Democrats note Gore has been closing the gap in
polls. Last October, Bush's lead in the University of Cincinnati's
Ohio Poll was 24 points. In January it was 13, and more recently,
9.
</P>
<P>
   But its too early for poll numbers to mean much. Too many
political questions linger.
</P>
<P>
   How much impact will Gov. Taft have campaigning for Bush? Will
Columbus Mayor Coleman help Gore pick up support in a traditionally
conservative city? Will the criminal investigation of U.S. Rep.
James Traficant, D-Youngstown, hurt Gore in a Democratic
stronghold?
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is up for grabs, both parties know that and it has
both sides a little nervous heading into the real part of the
campaign season,'' said Staci Rhine, a political scientist from
Wittenberg University in Springfield. ``What happens with the
economy as far as interest rates, gas prices and the stock market
will also have an impact on voters between now and November.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the pier in Sandusky Bay, Harry Ruzicka thought about
what it would be like to go fishing with Gore and Bush. He said
Gore would probably talk too much and scare away the fish, and Bush
would probably drink all of his beer.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ruzicka got serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to make fun of guys running for that office, but one
of them is going to be president, for God's sake. One of them will
end up reeling me in, I just don't know which one yet.''

 &HT;    U.S. usually goes with Montgomery County's political flow
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft, talking about why Ohio is
important for presidential hopefuls, explained that the state has
all aspects of American life _ big cities and small towns, farms
and businesses, a significant labor presence, and ``mainstream
values that are reflective of the middle of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He could as easily have been talking about Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and party officials say there may not be a
better place to take the country's political temperature than the
Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery County is the ultimate political measuring stick
for both parties,'' said Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio
Republican Party. ``If you can win over voters in Montgomery
County, you have a pretty good chance to win the state and the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the county has supported the winning
presidential candidate in 11 of 13 elections. Only in 1960, when
the county narrowly favored Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy, and
in 1980, when Jimmy Carter barely carried the county over Ronald
Reagan, did local voting results failed to mirror Ohio and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   That's not lost on the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Already, Gore has been here twice and
Bush once. And Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, has been to
Dayton twice more in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County has just about every kind of voter a
presidential candidate must connect with to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Its work force wears blue and white collars. More than 20,000
auto workers here make everything from SUVs for General Motors to
air conditioning parts for Chrysler. Thousands of engineers and
technicians drive the area's technology base at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base and at large companies such as NCR, Reynolds &AMP;
Reynolds and Mead Corp. There are farmers, college students, and
minority communities; a central city on the rebound and a new
political mix fed by suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But swing voters are what really make Montgomery County the
state's political hot potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the most volatile place in the state and we
generally go with the winner,'' said Montgomery County Republican
Chairman Jeff Jacobson. ``I think Montgomery County has always had
a strong tradition of independent voting. What it lacked for so
many years was a strong Republican base. . . . Now we are much more
50/50.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Republicans now outnumber Democrats in the county,
75,335 to 57,137, but those numbers were set by the March 7
primary, when party affiliation is determined in Ohio, and were
driven by a hot Republican contest between Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain. The county supported Clinton in the past two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County does not have the sheer number of voters that
will pull the candidates regularly to bigger metropolitan areas
such as Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus. But it may count as
much as those cities because it doesn't dramatically lean toward
the left or right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery County is critical more from the perception that
the state goes the way the county goes,'' said Montgomery County
Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   It's much too early to say which way the county might in
November. Both Bush and Gore have support here.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Linda Wafer, a 52-year-old mother of three from West
Dayton, are already sold on Gore. Wafer doesn't care about Gore's
image problems or how he differs from President Clinton. She is a
Democrat and believes Gore will do more for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is trying hard to be black or Hispanic, but that
ain't working on me,'' Wafer said. ``I'm black and I know a rich
white guy when I see one.''
</P>
<P>
   Other voters like Tiffany Becker, a 20-year-old Wright State
University student from Vandalia, are set on Bush. She is still
ashamed of President Clinton's fling with an intern and can't
forgive Gore for calling Clinton one of the nation's greatest
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gov. Bush has good ideas for schools and has a strong
faith. I see him being a stronger leader than Gore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters just haven't made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of president either of these guys will
make,'' said Tom Sandstrom, a 41-year-old engineer and Kettering
resident. ``We'll see what they do between now and the election.''

 &HT;    U.S. usually goes with Montgomery County's political flow
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft, talking about why Ohio is
important for presidential hopefuls, explained that the state has
all aspects of American life _ big cities and small towns, farms
and businesses, a significant labor presence, and ``mainstream
values that are reflective of the middle of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He could as easily have been talking about Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and party officials say there may not be a
better place to take the country's political temperature than the
Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery County is the ultimate political measuring stick
for both parties,'' said Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio
Republican Party. ``If you can win over voters in Montgomery
County, you have a pretty good chance to win the state and the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the county has supported the winning
presidential candidate in 11 of 13 elections. Only in 1960, when
the county narrowly favored Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy, and
in 1980, when Jimmy Carter barely carried the county over Ronald
Reagan, did local voting results failed to mirror Ohio and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   That's not lost on the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Already, Gore has been here twice and
Bush once. And Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, has been to
Dayton twice more in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County has just about every kind of voter a
presidential candidate must connect with to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Its work force wears blue and white collars. More than 20,000
auto workers here make everything from SUVs for General Motors to
air conditioning parts for Chrysler. Thousands of engineers and
technicians drive the area's technology base at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base and at large companies such as NCR, Reynolds &AMP;
Reynolds and Mead Corp. There are farmers, college students, and
minority communities; a central city on the rebound and a new
political mix fed by suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But swing voters are what really make Montgomery County the
state's political hot potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the most volatile place in the state and we
generally go with the winner,'' said Montgomery County Republican
Chairman Jeff Jacobson. ``I think Montgomery County has always had
a strong tradition of independent voting. What it lacked for so
many years was a strong Republican base. . . . Now we are much more
50/50.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Republicans now outnumber Democrats in the county,
75,335 to 57,137, but those numbers were set by the March 7
primary, when party affiliation is determined in Ohio, and were
driven by a hot Republican contest between Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain. The county supported Clinton in the past two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County does not have the sheer number of voters that
will pull the candidates regularly to bigger metropolitan areas
such as Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus. But it may count as
much as those cities because it doesn't dramatically lean toward
the left or right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery County is critical more from the perception that
the state goes the way the county goes,'' said Montgomery County
Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   It's much too early to say which way the county might in
November. Both Bush and Gore have support here.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Linda Wafer, a 52-year-old mother of three from West
Dayton, are already sold on Gore. Wafer doesn't care about Gore's
image problems or how he differs from President Clinton. She is a
Democrat and believes Gore will do more for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is trying hard to be black or Hispanic, but that
ain't working on me,'' Wafer said. ``I'm black and I know a rich
white guy when I see one.''
</P>
<P>
   Other voters like Tiffany Becker, a 20-year-old Wright State
University student from Vandalia, are set on Bush. She is still
ashamed of President Clinton's fling with an intern and can't
forgive Gore for calling Clinton one of the nation's greatest
presidents.

   OLY-ENGLE-EQUESTRIAN _ WELLINGTON, N.J. _ The 2000 U.S. Olympic
Trials for show jumping begin Wednesday at a beautifully manicured
equestrian center in New Jersey, but that is far too tight a focus

Incredible, right? Not for this good doctor. ``I had a bad day,''

   TV-SURVIVIOR-RATINGS _ ``Survivor,'' a breakout hit in every
way, has stunned the television industry by generating for CBS the
kind of ratings with young viewers that normally are associated
with shows on the Fox network or ABC. Last week, ``Survivor''
pulled in the most viewers under the age of 50 of any series CBS
has played on a Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in the entire 13-year
history of the Nielsen people-meter system. By Bill Carter and

   TALENT-AGENT (Los Angeles) _ Since taking the president's job at
the Beverly Hills headquarters of William Morris last August, the
talent agent Jim Wiatt has not just sought to fix William Morris
but has shaken up the talent agency business with a relentless
effort to lure stars from his old employer, only two miles away.
Even by the brass-knuckle standards of two former William Morris
agents, Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, who used similar tactics 20
years ago to turn Creative Artists into the town's dominant agency,
Wiatt's efforts have been surprising, dramatic and fast-moving. By

   NORTEL-CANADA (Undated) _ Nortel, the Canadian
telecommunications equipment giant, has become a company for the
Americas. It is growing so rapidly outside Canada that doubts are
being expressed at home about its corporate citizenship. Its
headquarters remains in Brampton, Ontario, but more of its 75,000
employees live and work south of the Canada-U.S. border than north
of it. And these days, just 9 percent of its $18 billion in
revenues comes from Canada. By Anthony DePalma.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zach Apter, a 23-year-old management consultant in San
Francisco, is hardly the typical CBS viewer; he cannot remember
watching anything on CBS since he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   That was before ``Survivor.'' Now Apter is so involved with the
hit CBS series about survival and relationship tests on an tropical
island near Borneo that he has organized a pool with his friends
($100 each) to select which contestant winds up as the final
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most over-the-top thing on TV that I've ever seen or
heard of,'' Apter said. ``I'm not going to miss a single one.''
</P>
<P>
   These are words from a man who is less than half the median age
of a viewer of CBS _ long identified as the network of the rural
and the retired.
</P>
<P>
   And Apter is far from alone. ``Survivor,'' a breakout hit in
every way, has stunned the television industry by generating for
CBS the kind of ratings with young viewers that normally are
associated with shows on the Fox network or ABC. Last week,
``Survivor'' pulled in the most viewers under the age of 50 of any
series CBS has aired on a Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in the 13-year
history of the Nielsen people-meter system, which breaks down
viewers into demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The show's success has enormous financial implications for CBS.
Young viewers usually translate into high prices for commercials
because many advertisers pay a premium to reach the young, who
watch less television than older viewers and are more likely to be
willing to change brands. One reason CBS' revenues have lagged
behind those of other networks has been its inability to attract
that premium money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' was sold in advance to a group of full sponsors,
including Reebok, Budweiser and the Army. But the show does have
two 30-second commercials available for sale in the rest of its
episodes and these are being quickly snapped up by advertisers like
movie companies, which always look to reach young viewers. An
executive connected to the negotiations said CBS is charging as
much as $300,000 each for these commercials, 50 percent more than
the full sponsors have been paying.
</P>
<P>
   And in what will almost certainly create another windfall, CBS
is considering expanding the ``Survivor'' finale on Aug. 23 from
one hour to two, which would open up an hour's worth of high-priced
commercials. The network may charge as much as $600,000 for the new
spots. (In the final episode, the last four contestants will first
be narrowed to two and then to one final survivor.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the young viewers CBS is hoping to cash in on simply had
not been available to it before. Eric Robinson, a motion picture
talent agent in New York, who is also 23, said, ``What other shows
are on CBS?'' But he is watching ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see the type of drama that would unfold with these
people stuck on an island,'' he said. ``It's like `Real World'
meets `Lord of the Flies.' And I wanted to see people eat rats.''
And so they did on last Wednesday's third episode of the 13-episode
summer series.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Hartley, also 23, a government consultant in Washington,
said she had heard about the show on a radio commercial _ not
because she had been watching CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Hartley heard about the show through radio was not
an accident. CBS, realizing it was unlikely to reach a young
audience using only its own airwaves, began promoting ``Survivor''
last year on the Internet. Then it started buying time on outlets
it knew young people would be plugged into: cable channels like MTV
and Comedy Central, and rock radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Later, of course, that became much easier when Viacom merged
with CBS, bringing along those two cable channels. CBS already had
numerous radio stations in its corporate family through its
subsidiary Infinity Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   But now CBS may not need MTV as much. The success of
``Survivor'' gives it an opportunity to speak directly to an
audience it has not been able to reach for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had this goal for years, trying to get younger,'' said
Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television. Three years ago he
bought the comedy ``Family Matters'' away from ABC, where it had a
big audience among children and teen-agers. They did not watch it
on CBS. He tried police dramas like ``Easy Street'' and youthful
comedies like ``Grapevine.'' They died quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But now the news is better, thanks to what CBS is calling the
halo effect created by ``Survivor.'' Last week, for example, CBS
had six of the top 10 shows among viewers between the ages of 18 to
49, a feat it had not achieved in any season in memory that did not
include the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And a host of CBS shows have scored big gains from last year
among viewers under 35: ``King of Queens'' is up 39 percent;
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is up 34 percent; and the Monday
edition of ``48 Hours'' is up 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most telling is that in the last two weeks, CBS has plugged the
two-hour slot after ``Survivor'' on Wednesday nights with repeats
of theatrical movies; they were up 110 percent with viewers under
35.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is moving as best it can to capitalize on the access
``Survivor'' is providing to the young crowd. It already has
announced that it would change the start date of its follow-up
reality series, ``Big Brother,'' from Thursday, July 6, to
Wednesday, July 5, to take advantage of the ``Survivor'' lead-in.
(CBS has hopes that ``Big Brother,'' a 90-night documentary of the
lives of 10 people locked together in a house, where every move is
on camera, will have similar fascination for younger viewers.)
</P>
<P>
   Now CBS is revamping its Wednesday schedule for the summer. On
June 28, the network will broadcast repeats of its two best
comedies, ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ``King of Queens,'' from
9 to 10 p.m. after ``Survivor.'' Later this summer it will put
shows like ``Judging Amy'' and ``JAG'' in that time period, hoping
to showcase them for young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans reflect Moonves' overall strategy of letting young
viewers see the CBS shows they may have liked all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why the median age for `Raymond' is 49 and
the median age for `Frasier' is 41,'' he said. ``Other than the
fact that one is on CBS and the other is on NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said CBS would use ``Survivor'' to promote some new
shows for fall, including ``Yes, Dear,'' which is about younger
married couples, and the remake of ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Studios that have been reluctant to sell their better shows to
CBS because they did not think they could appeal to young viewers
may also come calling now _ as long as they think they have a shot
at the time period after ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they are watching the show, at least some of the young
viewers are not taking it too seriously. One of the participants in
Apter's ``Survivor'' pool, Ben Decker, a 24-year-old management
consultant from San Francisco, called the program ``sort of
ludicrous'' and questioned whether it was going to work for CBS in
the long run. But for now he is totally committed to CBS _ at least
one night a week. After all, he has a serious rooting interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really find funny is watching CBS drum up suspense and
contention between the contestants,'' he said. ``I think if CBS
could, they would set these people against each other with swords
and tridents in a pit full of tigers.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most writers speak poorly about their work. And is work the
right word? As a child I doubted that telling stories to strangers
could be a serious endeavor, especially since often those stories
were not even true. Everybody knows that stories are, by
definition, the fantasies of those who don't know how to do
anything else. I thought of writers as clumsy, lazy and frankly
useless. Actually, one could very well live without them.
</P>
<P>
   In the secular school I was sometimes forced to attend, my
teachers made me read novels: first Romanian, then Hungarian
novels. But I would lie if I said I remember their titles or the
names of their authors, for I was too absorbed in my study of
sacred literature. The stories and their commentaries about the
binding of Isaac, Jacob's fight with the angel, the Revelation at
Sinai or Moses' solitary death interested me much more than the
fictional adventures of our national writers.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the Talmud with its often stormy debates, the
spellbinding power of Midrashic legends. I loved to plunge into
their deep waters. There were times, as I tried to solve ancient
questions with the help of masters and disciples of long ago, that
I would smile, responding to the magic of personal encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Hasidic stories were my favorite. To hear my maternal
grandfather tell them in his nostalgic yet lively manner was to be
transported into a world apart, a vivid realm in which the wicked
always ended humbled and punished, whereas their victims forgot
their misfortunes and found themselves invoking their right to
happiness. In short, this was a world in which miracles were part
of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Hasidic tales, the ones I loved best were those told
by Franz Kafka's predecessor, the celebrated and mysterious Rabbi
Nahman of Bratslav. They made me dream. When Kafka, the great
novelist from Prague, spoke of his wish to see his tales turned
into prayers, he was more than likely thinking of Rabbi Nahman.
Only he did the reverse: he transformed his prayers into tales. Was
Rabbi Nahman then Kafka's teacher? Perhaps, but surely he is mine.
</P>
<P>
   I still feel close to his beggars and madmen roaming through
forests inhabited by princes in love with exiled princesses. There
one hears the wondrous songs that lift the soul to its celestial
roots but also the harsh laughter that signals the nefarious
presence of demons ready to tear apart the heart of man so as to
consolidate their eternal reign.
</P>
<P>
   I confess that had I not been drawn to that strange and
beautiful universe, I might not have written some of my books,
surely not those that reflect my love for the Hasidic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But what about my other books, my novels? Or my short stories,
essays and plays?
</P>
<P>
   My very first book, ``Night,'' was, paradoxically, born more in
certainty than doubt. I knew I had to testify about my past but did
not know how to go about it. Here, neither Talmudic sages nor Rabbi
Nahman and his peers were of much help. In fact, in spite of all my
readings _ for in the meantime I had studied French, German and
American classics _ I felt incapable and perhaps unworthy of
fulfilling my task as survivor and messenger. I had things to say
but not the words to say them.
</P>
<P>
   Acutely aware of the poverty of my means, language became
obstacle. At every page I thought, ``That's not it.'' So I began
again with other verbs and other images. No, that wasn't it either.
But what exactly was that  &UR; it  &LR; I was searching for? It must have
been all that eludes us, hidden behind a veil so as not to be
stolen, usurped and trivialized. Words seemed weak and pale.
</P>
<P>
   Which ones could be used to tell of the long journey in sealed
cattle cars toward the unknown? And of the discovery of a twisted
and cold universe where some people came to kill and others to die?
And of the separation, during nights engulfed by flames, the brutal
disruption of families, what words could describe them? And the
disappearance of a small Jewish child so wise and so beautiful when
she smiled, killed together with her mother the very night of their
arrival? Before these images, all words disintegrate and fall
lifeless into the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was necessary to continue. And speak without words;
more precisely, without the proper words. And to try to trust the
silence that surrounds and transcends them, while knowing, ``That
was still not it.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the reason why the manuscript _ written in Yiddish, my
mother tongue, and translated first into French and then into
English _ was rejected by all the major publishers in France and
the United States? In New York a renowned editor justified her
rejection in a letter to my literary agent: ``Anyway, this author
will never write another book.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right on one point: I never wrote another book about my
wartime experiences. ``Night'' silenced in me the voices that
clamored to be heard. Anyway, I thought, people will not listen.
</P>
<P>
   To a friend who wanted to know why I tend to avoid the subject
of Auschwitz in my work, I answered, ``Woe to the writer who is
overwhelmed by his subject.'' Instead I chose to write on the
Bible, the Talmud and Hasidism, and novels on Jerusalem, the Middle
Ages, mysticism, Communism and Alzheimer's disease, all so as not
to find myself among the dead. There were moments when I regretted
the times when, faithful to my vow, I let silence be my only link
to the violent but mute world of my nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, my first small volume got a good reception. Was it
the writing, or was I protected by the event it described?
Reviewers seemed to like me. Perhaps they agreed with the skeptical
New York editor who felt I would never write another book: Why
``kill'' him since he is already half dead?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I considered myself lucky. And I was. My second book was also a
succes d'estime. Yet a voice inside me kept warning me by
whispering Napoleon's mother's wise comment: ``if it would only
last.'' Well, it did not. The next book brought me my first
negative review. Why deny it? I was miserable. I wanted to go from
newsstand to newsstand and buy up every single copy of the daily
containing the unkind evaluation of my novel. Later I learned to
cope with nastiness better than with praise.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the passing of years I know that the fate of books is
not unlike that of human beings: Some bring joy, others anguish.
Yet one must resist the urge to throw away pen and paper. After
all, authentic writers write even if there is little chance for
them to be published; they write because they cannot do otherwise,
like Kafka's messenger who is privy to a terrible and imperious
truth that no one is willing to receive but is nonetheless
compelled to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Were he to stop, to choose another road, his life would become
banal and sterile. Writers write because they cannot allow the
characters that inhabit them to suffocate them. These characters
want to get out, to breathe fresh air and partake of the wine of
friendship; were they to remain locked in, they would forcibly
break down the walls. It is they who force the writer to tell their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Writing, however, is getting more and more difficult. Not to
repeat oneself is every writer's obsession. Not to slide into
sentimentality, not to imitate, not to spread oneself too thin. To
respect words that are heavy with their own past. Every word both
separates and links; it depends on the writer whether it becomes
wound or balm, curse or promise. It would be simple and comfortable
to play with words and win; all it takes is to play the game and
practice a bit of self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   But for my generation, playing games is not an option. We need
to bear witness, we need to hope, with Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav,
that with a measure of luck, some of our testimonies will safeguard
the essence of our prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the Jewish boy from my little Jewish town was wrong:
Writing is anything but easy.

JOURNALISTS RECONSIDER USE OF IMAGES OF CENTRAL PARK ASSAULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scenes, in some form or another, appeared all
over television and in the newspapers: lurid images from amateur
videotape showing young women having water poured on them, being
groped and having their shirts ripped off by a marauding group of
men who sexually assaulted dozens of women in Central Park last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some news organizations blurred the faces of the victims. But on
five news programs and in one newspaper, The New York Post, the
women were clearly identifiable, several with their shirts taken
off and others with no clothes on at all after the attacks, which
followed the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Most news organizations have policies that greatly limit the
identification of sexual assault victims because some view the
crimes as having a stigma attached to them and because victims are
less likely to come forward if they believe the crimes will be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   But the coverage last week showed how competitive heat can
overtake news organizations locked in a 24-hour cycle and how
questionable ethical decisions made by one outlet can influence
others.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to run the identifiable images led to debate in
some newsrooms and angered several women's rights groups, which
complained that showing the women's faces only added to their
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a traumatic situation, and there is a stigma attached
to sex crimes,'' said Nancy Millar, the president of the National
Organization for Women's New York City chapter. ``Running their
faces is just adding insult to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   After an onslaught of complaints, most television stations
pulled the unaltered pictures and The Post apologized in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur videotape was bought by, or given to, at least five
New York news stations last Monday afternoon, the day after the
attacks, which had begun to capture international attention. That
night, four stations _ WNBC, WABC, WCBS and the Fox affiliate, WNYW
_ ran the tape.
</P>
<P>
   WABC and WNBC used clips that primarily showed the attackers.
The faces of the women could not be seen. But WCBS and WNYW aired
more graphic pictures in which the nudity was blurred but many of
the women's faces were left unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, WNYW played video in slow motion of a woman
with no shirt on, crouched behind a wall, screaming and trying to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Madison, WNBC's news director and vice president, said she
had received the first tape about 4 p.m. last Monday, but decided
to withhold many of the more graphic details until after the tapes
could be properly edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I could get beat, but that is OK,'' she said. She
added that competition could not drive every decision or it would
``erode the public's confidence in your ability to tell the news in
a comprehensive and responsible fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But interest in the story continued to rise. Last Tuesday
morning, the story appeared on the front pages of The New York
Times, the Post and the Daily News. None of the newspapers used
images in which the women could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   But WCBS, WNYW, the WB affiliate WPIX and the UPN affiliate WWOR
continued to run the tape without blurring the victims' faces. That
morning, producers at New York 1, the city's 24-hour news channel,
received a tape of the events _ more than 10 hours after it first
appeared on other stations _ and quickly scanned it and placed it
on the air, showing close-ups of two of the women's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, a viewer wrote an e-mail message to New York 1
that read: ``These women had already been publicly humiliated once
_ why humiliate them again by putting their faces on television,
showing them sobbing and trying to cover themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   The video ran about three times that morning before Steve
Paulus, New York 1's senior vice president and general manager,
pulled it and ordered the women's faces blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be competitive with the other guys,'' said Peter
Landis, the news director at New York 1. ``There was a bad judgment
call to put it on the air before upper news management determined
how to present it properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulus sent out a memo in the afternoon reiterating the
station's policy against identifying victims of sex crimes. It also
said that what other stations were doing ``doesn't matter to us; we
shouldn't have used it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the competitive pressure lingered and also influenced the
Post. That afternoon, hoping to beat out other print competition,
the Post obtained images from its corporate cousin, British Sky
Broadcasting. And on Wednesday morning, the newspaper published
three pictures in which victims could clearly be identified,
including the woman cowering behind the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these images were played many times on television, we
felt there was little to be gained by altering them,'' Xana
Antunes, the Post's editor, said in an interview on Wednesday
afternoon. Antunes added that the paper was careful not to print
the names or addresses of the victims but spent little time
worrying about the images.
</P>
<P>
   ``On further reflection, we will take additional steps to
protect the victims' identities,'' she said in a statement released
later that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And TV stations' news programs had all taken the unaltered
images off the air by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief conversation, Susan Sullivan, news director at WNYW,
said that in the heat of competition. her producers had not thought
about editing the tape to protect the identities of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon I saw the tape run, I caught it, and we began
obscuring the faces,'' Sullivan said.

   CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ By relaxing rules and applying only a
spotty enforcement of travel restrictions, the Clinton
administration is opening Cuba to American travelers at a rate not
seen in more than 40 years. While administration officials deny
that the increased travel is intended to undermine the 38-year-old
embargo against Cuba, the new flow has given rise to a flurry of
business, personal and political contacts and there is a renewed

   BUSH-BIO-III (New Haven, Conn.) _ Born at the earliest fringe of
the baby boom, Bush was pressed during his years at Yale to take
sides in the great battles then unfolding over politics, civil
rights, drugs and music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those
upheavals, but when forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the
values and ideals established by his parents' generation. Unlike
others of his generation, like Clinton or Gore, Bush never wore his
hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with existentialism or
cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his parents (instead of
hard rock music, he listened to soul). Even today, Bush thunders in

   LOS-ALAMOS-SECURITY (Los Alamos, N.M.) _ The government was
already facing hurdles in its efforts to prosecute a scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, but last week's disclosures that two hard drives filled
with highly sensitive weapons data had inexplicably vanished have
potentially made it far more difficult for prosecutors in what had
once been described as a major national security case. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has insisted from the time he was indicted
last year that security breaches at the laboratory are common, and
that the kind of downloading he did -- moving classified data, in
the open, from a secure to unsecured computer, then downloading it
to tapes -- was done frequently by other experts protecting data
from an unreliable computer system. 1500 words. By James Sterngold.

NIGHT SCRAWLERS HAVE THEIR DAY, THOUGH PRICES DISAPPOINT
</HEADLINE>
 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gallery at the Puck Building was filled last week
with people who don't get out much. At least not out into the
light, where they might be recognized, and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Some call themselves artists, others boast that they are true
vandals. Some, who have retired to the comfort of suburban homes
and respectable careers, or who now show their work in galleries,
carefully spell out their names for reporters. Others, who still
prowl city streets, rooftops and subway tunnels, don't dare give
their names.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a subterranean fraternity born more than three
decades ago when the first of them began scrawling their names on
walls, but many had never met until last week, when two concurrent
graffiti events drew them to New York or out of their concrete city
hideaways. On Wednesday night, Guernsey's Auction House put the
work of some 100 graffiti writers, as they call themselves, on the
block; and on Saturday night two galleries in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn, State of the Art and Bellwether, in
collaboration with the Martinez Gallery in Manhattan, opened ``The
Painted Word,'' a retrospective of graffiti art since 1969, to run
until July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't only a gathering, it's a historic occasion,'' said
Wicked Gary, who was a member of the Experienced Vandals, otherwise
known as the Ex-Vandals, a graffiti crew formed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The work sold poorly at the auction, with pieces expected to go
for at least $10,000 selling at $3,000, and a painting by Lady
Pink, one of the few women who have become famous graffiti writers,
going for just $750. Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's,
declined to sum up the profits, and said only that sales were ``up
and down.'' Although some of the artists milled about the room
wearing grim expressions, many sloughed it off, saying the
important thing was that everyone had come together for what was
the first unofficial graffiti reunion.
</P>
<P>
   But even though there was clearly much admiration among some
artists, who traded auction catalogs collecting one another's
signatures, or tags, many of the artists spent the week settling
old scores and trying to validate their places in the graffiti
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like cleaning shop,'' said Michael Tracy, or Tracy 168,
who wrote ``wild style'' graffiti starting in 1969. ``Now that
we're all in one room, you can't say this guy innovated this,
because I can say, `Oh yeah?' and walk across the room and see if
they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the auction and the gallery shows feature the work of
several ``old school'' train writers, like Taki 183, Case 2, Flint
707 and Bama, as well as pieces by artists who achieved gallery
fame in the 1980s, like Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and Jean-Michel
Basquiat. And there is also a significant representation of work by
new, young graffiti writers _ like Moesco, Giz and Nato _ who are
still trying to redefine the genre on city streets
</P>
<P>
   Many of the older writers, who started painting trains when
hippies were still a novelty, said the auction _ in which the four
pieces by Kenny Scharf failed to sell at all _ would help put the
work of ``art stars'' in perspective. Some felt they were
overlooked in the 1980s when a small coterie of art school
graduates became the toast of the downtown gallery scene, without
first paying their dues in the train yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s the work was redefined by galleries and some of
the artists and curators started creating this terminology, like
`iconoclastic panderism' and `post-graffiti,''' said Roberto
Gualtieri, 43, who started writing his name, CoCo, on the backs of
city buses in 1969. ``It's a lot of hype. Part of the criteria of
being a writer was street credibility. Whoever doesn't have it is
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who spent years selling work in galleries said it took
a different set of skills to make it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like two different spheres,'' said Aaron Charles
Goodstone, also known as Sharp, who has shown in galleries,
primarily in Europe, since 1983. ``There are some people who have
been able to eke out a living on canvas and have had the
wherewithal to be in the public arena. You have to be able to
travel, and talk about your work articulately, and show up. Anybody
who is a working artist in the context of the studio has a whole
different set of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   These arguments tend to bore younger graffiti writers, who have
tried to stretch the form in recent years under increasingly harsh
conditions. The Giuliani administration now spends about $25
million a year fighting graffiti, and 10 years ago the Transit
Authority instituted a ``clean car'' policy, which dictates that no
train leave the yard if it is marked. And while in the 1970s those
caught vandalizing subway cars were given a couple of days in jail
and required to clean up their scrawls, a graffiti writer caught
today faces felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to realize that's just the graffiti ego: No matter
how you write, whoever wrote just before you is the best, and the
people who write just after you are the worst,'' said Kunle
Martins, a 20-year-old from the Bronx who writes Earsnot, which he
said stands for ``Extravagant Artist Renovating Styles Not
Orthodoxed to Taggers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like as soon as you get a tiny little bit of fame you
think everyone else is toy,'' or someone who copies other's
hieroglyphics, Martins said.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers carrying backpacks filled with spray cans and
artist's black books lined up agog in front of legendary writers
like Case 2 and Mico, who are now in their 40s. And though there
was clearly admiration here, the younger generation, which paints
on rooftops, trucks and walls inside subway tunnels was skeptical
about the nature of the event, arguing that even the pioneers had
lost the true spirit of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice and all, but it's not graffiti,'' said Giz, 23,
who paints ``throw-ups,'' or his name in bubble letters, on the
sides of trucks, stores and police stations. ``A lot of people
forget that graffiti is street art, it's not gallery art. This is
the first time that graffiti is starting to get civilized, but you
still got to keep it on the ground, otherwise it's not worth
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rich Admiral, who has been known as Bama on the street since
1969 and has sold paintings in galleries since 1973, said that
graffiti had always struggled between those two poles. He looked
around the gallery, watching his compatriots, three generations of
night scrawlers, gather and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize that everyone in this room is insane,'' he said
affectionately. ``It's not normal to want to go out in the middle
of the night and write your name on a wall. We all have our
personal ghosts, and we all have our dirty laundry and rivalries.
But it's like any family, and this is my family.''

ADVERTISING: CAMPAIGN CAPITALIZES ON FIENDISH AND FUNNY USES FOR
LOOSE CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Converting the loose change on the bedroom dresser into ``real
money'' is probably on the bottom of most people's ``to do'' lists,
right up there with organizing the sock drawer.
</P>
<P>
   But a new campaign for Coinstar, the nation's largest
manufacturer of self-service coin-counting machines, seeks to
reverse those sentiments by using humor to exhort consumers to dump
the contents of their piggy banks into the company's machines and
become empowered by their ``new found'' money.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million brand-building TV campaign is the first for
Coinstar by the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of the Omnicom Group since the
agency's office in Playa del Rey, Calif., was awarded the account
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Coinstar campaign represents a notable evolution, both
strategically and creatively, from previous advertising efforts,''
said Rich Stillman, vice president for marketing at Coinstar in
Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our ads focused on the rational benefits of our
service, such as convenience and ease of use. To better connect
with consumers the new ads are designed to strike an emotional
chord, conveying a brand personality for Coinstar that is human,
empathetic, inspiring and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Coinstar estimates that two-thirds of Americans accumulate on
average over $600 worth of change every year. Research found,
however, that only about 12 percent have ever tried using the
Coinstar service.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, our main strategy is to build awareness and trial of our
service,'' Stillman said, asserting that ``125 million Americans
live within two miles of a Coinstar machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright green and purple self-service coin-counting machines
are in more than 7,500 groceries nationwide, including Albertson's,
Food Emporium, Kroger and Safeway. The machine is a PC that counts
coins and reimburses consumers after subtracting an 8.9 percent fee
for the service, with the supermarkets collecting 1 percent of
that. In addition, the machine issues vouchers and dispenses
discount coupons from other marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Coinstar's research found that the predominate experience when
using its machine is that most customers go into a supermarket with
a jar of coins expecting to collect $25 to $30, but have severely
underestimated how much money they actually have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling that people get is a little bit like winning the
lottery,'' Stillman said. ``It's just a fun experience. And that
was the part we wanted to capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Two 30-second humorous television commercials demonstrate how
coins can be changed into something useful in unusual ways by
featuring everyday situations and exaggerating them for effect into
``what if'' situations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one spot, which unfolds the story without
dialogue, features a 12-year-old boy sauntering down a city
sidewalk when two older boys torment him by tossing coins at him
from a second-story window. Day in and day out the boy simply picks
up the coins without missing a beat. The spot then cuts to the
tormented boy at a Coinstar machine converting a large jar of
coins. As an announcer states, ``Turn your change into something
useful,'' the two bullies are shown hanging out the tenement window
waiting to throw coins at the boy when they hear ``Beep. Beep.
Beep.'' As a shadow appears, they look down to the street and see
the younger boy operating a wrecking ball he has rented to get
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   A second commercial features a waitress in a cocktail lounge
dealing with a troublesome regular customer played by the character
actor Mike Hagerty, who is known for bit parts on television shows
that include ``Friends.'' In the spot, the heavyset sleazy
businessman comes in daily for a beer and harasses the waitress. He
cheaply tips her by placing coins in the front pocket of her apron,
invading her personal space at the same time. After suffering the
final indignity of a slap on the buttocks, the waitress visits the
Coinstar machine. The next night as the customer places his hand in
the waitress' apron his fingers are zapped. The scene then cuts to
the waitress putting her newly purchased Stun King stun gun in her
locker. The spot was unscripted with the dialogue ad-libbed by
Hagerty.
</P>
<P>
   Both spots end with the announcer stating the tagline,
``Coinstar. How much do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the campaign will get people to start looking at
that change as being a lot more than what they think it is and
here's an easy way to get rid of it and get cash for it,'' Jerry
Gentile, managing partner and creative director at TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   Using humor as a vehicle is certainly not unusual for
TBWA/Chiat/Day, which is known for work that entertains, in
particular its campaigns for longtime clients like Energizer,
Nissan and Taco Bell. The Coinstar effort is yet another campaign
to fall into Madison Avenue's long-running, contentious debate over
just how effective humorous advertising is in peddling products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that people's lives are just constantly being
bombarded with stuff, and I think you have got to find a way that
doesn't strangle people with messages,'' Gentile said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key with something like this, when it's a low
interest product _ something you don't think about everyday _ you
have to bring something to it to put a little more importance or a
little more interest in the subject,'' he added. ``I think humor
seems to be universal. It just seemed like an obvious way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots began running last month in 12 markets, including
Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington.
Coinstar will add additional markets later this year while three
radio commercials, with a similar creative format, began running
this month.

BUSH WHITTLING DOWN VP PROSPECTS, BUT MUM'S STILL THE WORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mo., Pa., Okla., Tenn., Neb., Ohio)  By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two of the biggest names, Gen. Colin L. Powell
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, have emphatically proclaimed their
lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Another widely rumored contender, former Sen. John C. Danforth
of Missouri, recently bowed out. And the governor on whom the early
speculation centered, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, is giving more
Republicans pause.
</P>
<P>
   With little more than a month to go before Gov. George W. Bush
settles on the person with whom he wants to share the Republican
presidential ticket, the list of possibilities seems to be getting
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean it is getting a whole lot clearer,
because Bush is holding his cards so close to the vest that even
his most trusted advisers insist they have not been able to sneak a
peek.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the Bush campaign's director of communications,
said that Bush leaves the room when he gets a call from former
Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney, who is supervising the
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out a Ouija board,'' said another adviser when asked about
the status of Bush's thinking on the matter. ``I'm not kidding, I'm
totally clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Texas governor told reporters that he was making
progress and talking frequently with Cheney. But he said he had no
intention of divulging the content of their conversations or
bringing too many people into the loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a committee to figure out who's best to be the
vice president,'' Bush said, adding, ``I'm going to take my time.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has not prevented fellow Republicans from
handicapping the race. And some of the buzz they are generating
seems to have a grounding in reality, because both Republican
officials who have no direct link to the Bush campaign and those
who interact frequently with Bush's advisers keep coming up with
the same handful of names.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost among them is Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma,
whose aides have acknowledged that he received a questionnaire that
Cheney sent out to prospective vice presidential nominees.
Republican officials noted that Keating is Roman Catholic,
performed well on a national stage during the Oklahoma City
bombing, has a squeaky-clean image and has long been friendly with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, also Catholic, is said to remain in the running, although
his support of abortion rights _ and the grief it has caused him
with Catholic leaders in his state _ makes him a riskier, more
controversial choice, some Republican strategists contend. They
said that if Bush, who opposes abortion, were doing poorly with
voters in the political center, Ridge might make more sense.
</P>
<P>
   But polls suggest that the Texas governor is doing well with
independents and moderates and would be wiser to avoid any possible
alienation of religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most basic rule of picking a vice president is `first, do
no harm','' said one adviser to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This adviser, and other Republican officials, said that other
politicians who seem to be getting at least some degree of genuine
consideration include Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee and Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. These sources put less
stock in Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, whose name occasionally gets
bandied about.
</P>
<P>
   But they cautioned that the final pick could be someone who is
generating absolutely no discussion, especially if recent history
is any guide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Bush's father took even members of his inner circle by
surprise when he hitched himself at the last moment to Dan Quayle.
Bob Dole's selection of Jack Kemp in 1996 also came out of left
field.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Republican officials and several of Bush's
advisers said, the Texas governor is freer than recent Republican
nominees to let his eye wander, or to go ultimately with his heart
and his gut.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when Ronald Reagan selected Bush's father, who had
opposed him in the primaries, he was working to unite the
conservative and moderate wings of a fractured Republican party. In
1996, Dole's unexpected choice of Kemp was partly an attempt to
inject some excitement into an underdog effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's united now,'' said one of Bush's advisers,
alluding to recent polls showing that nine out of 10 Republicans
support Bush. The adviser added that because of Bush's advantage
over Vice President Al Gore in most of those surveys, ``He's not in
the position of having to throw the long ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers and Republican strategists agreed that
geography, which would favor someone like Ridge, the governor of a
swing state, was increasingly unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 24-hour media outlets and all the different outlets
today, people can become known nationally instantly,'' said Bill
Dal Col, who managed Steve Forbes' presidential campaign. Others
said that the country's regional differences were no longer as
pronounced as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   A more important criterion to Bush may simply be choosing
someone with whom he is extremely comfortable. He has said over and
over that he wants a running mate with whom he shares a reciprocal
affection, and while that may sound like a stock platitude, people
who know him well note that he is a stickler for loyalty and puts
great value on the ease and pleasantness of his interactions with
associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Bush's top priority, far more than any tactical,
geographical or political consideration,'' said one Republican
official who interacts with the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's advisers said that Bush does not want to replicate
the situation between Reagan and his father, who were not that
close when they entered the White House, and whose staffs regarded
each other warily.
</P>
<P>
   That concern favors candidates like Keating and Ridge, both
longtime friends of Bush's. And because both of them are governors
and not members of Congress, Republican officials said, they would
also help Bush underscore his pledge to eradicate Washington's
partisan acrimony and gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   To a lesser extent, officials said, Hagel and Thompson could fit
into that pitch. Neither has served in the Senate for long. Both
have exhibited some maverick tendencies, as their support for
McCain in the primaries demonstrated. And both had long careers
outside politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the qualities that Bush has so successfully capitalized
on is his outsider status,'' said Scott Reed, who managed Dole's
presidential campaign. ``As he picks a running mate, I believe he
will be looking for someone from outside of Washington.''

`SCHUBERT': TAKING SCHUBERT OFF A CRACKING PEDESTAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few long-dead classical musicians have lived a more exciting
life over the last decade or so than Franz Schubert. And few
composers have more desperately needed such an upheaval to shake
off a lingering weight of pious myths a century and more in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   The Schubert of popular image was a veritable icon of
Biedermeier Vienna, a porcelain figurine waiting to happen. A
short, squat, bespectacled figure nicknamed Schwammerl (Little
Mushroom), he was shy, quaint and irresistibly charming to his many
male friends and to high-born women alike. The pieties took on
added urgency because of his tragic fate; he died in 1828, at 31,
just as he was reaching his mature stride; yet he left behind a
huge body of work. He simply exuded lovely melody, improvising
songs and dances at convivial gatherings or dashing them off on
restaurant napkins.
</P>
<P>
   Well, to begin with, make that  &UR; bar  &LR; napkins, and then only if
he could still see straight. For Schubert, it emerges even from
sanitized accounts by his friends that have increasingly come to
light, often drank to excess. What's more, he was versatile in his
dissolution, given to sensual passions of sundry types. Like
Brahms, he may well have consorted with prostitutes; the syphilis
that set in six years before his death and cut him down prematurely
had to start somewhere. His personality would probably be called
depressive today.
</P>
<P>
   All this has come clear of late. And to make matters more
interesting, the musical scholar Maynard Solomon has surmised, on
the basis of some of the scant surviving documents in the
composer's hand, that Schubert was gay. Since this theory gained
wide circulation in 1989, Schubert's sexuality has become one of
the hottest topics in Western musicology.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher H. Gibbs' slim volume, ``The Life of Schubert,'' in
Cambridge University Press' series Musical Lives, is therefore
timely and valuable. Though terse, it brings all those matters up
to date in an eminently readable manner.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, who teaches music at the State University at Buffalo,
edited ``The Cambridge Companion to Schubert'' of 1997. He also
took part in the later stages of the decadelong Schubertiade at the
92nd Street Y, which ended in 1997. Although he relies heavily on
secondary sources here, he has also done original research, and he
proposes a neat little theory of his own: a secret program for
Schubert's E flat Piano Trio.
</P>
<P>
   That work was begun some six months after Beethoven died, and
given its premiere on the first anniversary of his death on March
26, 1828 (eight months, it turned out, before Schubert's own
passing). Gibbs finds similarities in the trio, with its movement
resembling a funeral march, to Beethoven: especially to the
``Eroica'' Symphony, written in the same key ``in memory of a great
man.'' Although it was obvious to few others at the time that
Schubert, still little known outside Vienna or in grand musical
forms, was a logical candidate to take up Beethoven's mantle, from
this and other evidence it was apparent to Schubert, Gibbs
plausibly suggests, as it has been to posterity. ``While previous
commentators have called Schubert's movement a funeral march, and a
few have noticed the tonal, melodic and structural similarities to
Beethoven's symphony,'' Gibbs writes of his interpretation, ``the
greater meaning has remained secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But in so concise a tome, something has to give, and Gibbs
hastens to point out that the book is not everything it might
appear. ``This book concerns less `The Life of Schubert' than `The
Life of Schubert's Career,' a story more of the artist than the
man,'' he writes. ``In certain respects this book aims to be an
`antibiography.' I shall emphasize the distortion and
trivialization of his life that formed and informed popular
images.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Gibbs is no iconoclast or sensationalist. ``We
are currently at a point where some unproven claims about the
darker Schubert threaten to become a new orthodoxy in the absence
of sufficient historical investigation or evidence,'' he writes
judiciously. He spreads his skepticism evenly on new evidence and
theories as well as old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schubert remains in the shadows,'' he notes, ``even as some
try figuratively to bring him out of the closet and the pub and
into the psychiatrist's consulting room.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach is loosely chronological. But Gibbs begins by
examining three artistic representations of Schubertian soirees to
set the scene. And one biographical chapter is constructed around
themes raised in an 1824 letter from Schubert to his friend Leopold
Kupelwieser. ``In a word, I feel myself the most unhappy and
wretched creature in the world,'' the diseased composer writes.
``Imagine a man whose health will never be right again, and who in
sheer despair over this ever makes things worse and worse instead
of better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs' emphases, though sometimes repetitious, are often
fascinating. He notes, for example, that for the composer, most of
his output was prelude. In 1827 Schubert acknowledged, among other
works, ``three operas, a Mass and a symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs elaborates: ``At first the comment seems curious: Schubert
had written some eight operas, five Masses, seven (and a half)
symphonies and so much else; yet he willingly acknowledged only
fully mature pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical discussion is nontechnical. Although many works are
located in the unfolding of Schubert's career, few are discussed in
detail. Still, what comment there is is cogent, as when Gibbs cites
Schubert's ``uncanny ability to make the major mode sound
despairing.'' Can any listener fail to be relieved, for example,
when, in ``Gute Nacht,'' the opening song of the cycle
``Winterreise,'' the music slumps back into D minor after the
painfully illusory hope raised by the excursion into D major?
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs spends perhaps too much time trying to tie the mood of a
specific work to the mood of the composer when writing it. Yes such
correspondences can sometimes emerge, the more so with such new
evidence as Gibbs supplies. Still, the creative process is at
bottom mysterious, and those one-to-one alignments inevitably break
down sooner rather than later. It is also surprising to see so
redoubtable a Schubertian refer to the composer's ``great C major''
Symphony (No. 9, that is, in mere contradistinction to the ``little
C major,'' No. 6) loosely as the ``Great'' Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Gibbs, with his solid grounding and balanced view,
packs a great deal into a small space and supplies a corrective
still sorely needed, or, as he suggests, needed now more than ever,
as seductive new theories mingle freely with comfortable old myths.

   HOLLYWOOD _ In its heyday, the venerable William Morris agency
dominated Hollywood, representing legends like Marilyn Monroe,
Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Charlie Chaplin, Will Rogers, Fannie
Brice, Al Jolson and Mae West. But by the late 1980s, the agency
had stumbled and was hemorrhaging clients and agents, the result of
its board's apathy and old-guard ways coupled with the death of its
top Hollywood agent, Stan Kamen, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, William Morris was dwarfed by two
agencies, Creative Artists and International Creative Management,
which represented a sizable chunk of movie and television stars and
directors. ``The movie division needed some fixing,'' said Jim
Wiatt, the former co-chairman of International Creative Management
and now president and co-chief executive of William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt spoke with considerable understatement. Since taking the
job at the Beverly Hills headquarters of William Morris last
August, the 53-year-old agent has not just sought to fix William
Morris but has shaken up the talent agency business with a
relentless effort to lure stars from his old employer, only two
miles away. Even by the brass-knuckle standards of two former
William Morris agents, Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, who used
similar tactics 20 years ago to turn Creative Artists into the
town's dominant agency, Wiatt's efforts have been surprising,
dramatic and fast-moving.
</P>
<P>
   The agency business itself is in the grip of change in
Hollywood. Facing a studio system relying mostly on star vehicles,
television networks nervous about declining audiences, competition
from talent managers and even lawyers, agents are involving
themselves _ and their clients _ in the world of the Internet and
high technology as they seek ways to expand their financial base.
But success and failure in the agency business hinges on a question
that has remained the same since the 1920s: How many high-priced
clients does an agency represent?
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, seven talent agents have joined Wiatt from
ICM. The most recent arrival, Steve Dontanville, one of ICM's top
agents, brings with him, among others, Meg Ryan, Sigourney Weaver,
Julianne Margulies, Courtney Love, Alfre Woodard and Patrick
Stewart. Other former ICM agents have brought to William Morris
clients like Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Emily Watson and
Spike Lee. Wiatt himself has signed up Michael Douglas from
Creative Artists. And former clients of his at ICM like Eddie
Murphy, Sylvester Stallone, Tim Allen, Nora Ephron and Penny
Marshall have joined him at William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The reason so many agents have moved out of ICM, which remains
very powerful despite the losses, is, to some degree, loyalty to
Wiatt, who was a mentor and friend to them. But, more important,
money was a driving factor. Agents are well paid. A veteran and
second-tier talent agent could earn $750,000 to $1 million a year,
perhaps more with bonuses. By all accounts, William Morris
increased the ante to lure the agents. An ICM agent said that a
former colleague, who earned $550,000, was being paid nearly double
that figure at William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, agents at ICM are outraged at Wiatt, who worked in
top jobs there for 23 years and seems intent, they said, on hurting
the agency. (Wiatt personally tried to lure a British film director
away from one of his old friends at William Morris.) Publicly,
executives at ICM _ an agency with clients like Mel Gibson, Julia
Roberts, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Cameron Diaz, Michelle
Pfeiffer, Chris Rock and Rosie O'Donnell _ said the exodus of
agents and stars to join Wiatt was, essentially, the nature of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win some, you lose some,'' said Ed Limato, co-president of
ICM, who represents numerous movie stars. ``We're cushioned against
such things. We have a great bench, we have reserves. Jim's an old
friend. I'm sorry he's gone. So we start a new era. Just look at
our client list.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Berg, chairman of the agency, said he had expected some
agents to follow Wiatt. Although partners with Berg, Wiatt was
known to have had a distant, chilly relationship with him and to
have been eager to leave, especially after William Morris offered
him a contract far more lucrative than his $1.5 million pay package
at ICM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a senior leader, after 23 years, who left and became a
competitor,'' Berg said, adding that Wiatt's departure would have
no financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business for the last 10 years has been on a growth
trajectory,'' he said, and he added that he was certain that would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, a well-liked figure in Hollywood who is known for his
friendliness and approachability, has surprised his close friends
with the tough tactics. He has overhauled the New York office of
William Morris, and trimmed the London unit. About 18 agents have
departed. In the process, William Morris has also lost important
clients, mostly to Creative Artists. These include performers like
George Clooney, Brendan Fraser, Joseph Fiennes, Gillian Anderson
and Matthew Perry, and directors like Anthony Minghella (``The
English Patient'') and John Madden (``Shakespeare in Love'').
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, seated in an office at William Morris with his former
colleague at ICM, David Wirtschafter, who is head of worldwide
motion pictures at William Morris, said: ``The priority was the
movie division. It needed some new blood. And I think from a morale
standpoint it probably wasn't operating as well as it should have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Wirtschafter, who represents mostly writers and
directors, said he had joined Wiatt out of ``enormous personal and
professional loyalty to him.'' A somewhat distant and intense
figure, Wirtschafter has, according to one agent, unnerved some of
the veteran William Morris agents working for him with his biting
comments. ``What's happened here in terms of the change in profile,
and the absolutely extraordinary agent and client migration, is, in
large part, due to Jim,'' Wirtschafter said.

</P>
<P>
   The last time such an exodus of clients occurred _ and it took
place over several years _ began in 1986 when Stan Kamen, who ran
the movie division of William Morris and was Hollywood's top agent,
died. Kamen's client list was a Who's Who of Hollywood stars of the
1970s: Goldie Hawn, Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford
and Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   What followed over the next few years was an exodus of agents
and their clients to Creative Artists and ICM, and a steady decline
in the film unit of an agency that had been founded in 1898 by a
German immigrant, William Morris, and had its start placing singers
and comics on the vaudeville circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, the company's mailroom employed aspiring agents
like Barry Diller, David Geffen and Michael Ovitz. The company's
wealth was based not only on its client base, but substantial real
estate holdings in Beverly Hills and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company's leadership is dominated as it always was by
businessmen representing few, if any, clients. The result was an
agency _ and an 11-member board _ that was, until recently, the
most buttoned-up in town, rooted in tradition and conservative by
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Zifkin, chief executive at William Morris, said Wiatt's
performance so far had been ``beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's considerable and it's strengthened us,'' Zifkin said.
``He's brought over some very good people with very good clients.
He's bought over good people who are very compatible with our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt replaced Arnold Rifkin, who represented Bruce Willis and
others, and who struggled in the mid-1990s to put William Morris on
a par with Creative Artists and ICM. But Rifkin damaged his career
at William Morris when he negotiating secretly for a top movie job
at Sony in 1996: by all accounts the William Morris board never
forgave him once the news was leaked. William Morris executives
said they were also unhappy that Rifkin had failed to sign up many
high-priced stars.
</P>
<P>
   The agency shifts are taking place against a backdrop of
unusually intense turmoil, even for a business where turmoil is the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the agency business was basically like a high
school club _ you were judged how cool and important you were
depending on what club had you as a member,'' said Jim Berkus,
president of the United Talent Agency, a significant player now in
the agency business. ``During the Stan Kamen era at William Morris,
it was cool to be in the Morris club. During the height of Mike
Ovitz's power, it was cool to be in the CAA club.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now there are four or five different agencies in town, and
clients are less concerned about the name of the agency and the
number of times the agents get their picture in `Vanity Fair,''' he
said. ``Clients are asking, `What level of service am I getting for
my commission?''' (Clients generally pay 10 percent of their
earnings to agents.)
</P>
<P>
   Berkus' United Talent Agency, once a secondary player, now has
such high-priced clients as Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, Kevin
Costner, Madonna and Drew Carey and the television writer-producers
David Chase (``The Sopranos'') and Dick Wolf (``Law and Order'').
</P>
<P>
   Other agents agree with Berkus.
</P>
<P>
   Although Creative Artists lost some clients after Ovitz abruptly
quit in 1995 to briefly become president of the Walt Disney Co. _
and there were predictions in newspapers that the agency would
splinter _ it remains the No. 1 agency in Hollywood, representing
stars like Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, and
directors such as Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Michael
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the most stable game in town,'' said Bryan Lourd, one of
the managing partners of Creative Artists. ``Five years ago,
everyone said we were going down. Look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lovett, the agency's president, echoed the view that the
current warfare between William Morris and ICM helps Creative
Artists, which has deliberately sought to soften its image as the
town's bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a company that people were afraid of,'' he said. ``It
was a fear-based company. We don't believe in that kind of company.
Maybe with the change of image it appears that we're not the
fearsome machine we were. But we would argue that the results are
better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of factors behind the shifts in the agency
business. Agencies are competitively struggling to gain a foothold
in the Internet world, to satisfy cable television's hunger for
material, to arrange film financing deals for clients' movies. The
result is that smaller agencies like Endeavor and
Broder-Kurland-Webb-Uffner are substantial players in the Hollywood
arena, alongside the bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency business has not changed so much over the years,
but everything around us has changed,'' said Bob Broder, one of the
founders of the respected agency with a heavy clientele of writers
and directors.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Zimmer, a top agent at the United Talent Agency, was more
blunt. ``In a weird way, all of the major agencies are spending a
lot of time coping with the same problems as opposed to each other
as the problem,'' he said. Except in the case of the William Morris
agency and International Creative Management.

   HEARTLAND-OHIO _ Ohio has been fickle when picking presidents.
Since the Great Depression started in 1929, the state has supported
nine Republicans and seven Democrats. President Clinton won Ohio in
in both his bids for the White House, but in 1992 against George
Bush he won by only two percentage points. If it weren't for Ross
Perot, Clinton might have lost the state. The race in Ohio between
Vice President Gore, the Democrat, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
may be even closer. Both men need Ohio and its 21 electoral votes
as much, if not more, than any other state. No Republican has ever
captured the presidency without winning Ohio. And the Democrats
haven't won the Buckeye state in three consecutive elections since
Franklin Roosevelt did it in 1932, 1936 and 1940. (Wagner, Dayton

HUMAN GENOME TREASURE MAP POINTS THE WAY TO DNA GOLD

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon, perhaps within days, researchers expect to announce
completion of the decadelong project to map the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   If you hadn't already been paying attention, both Business Week
and The New Yorker recently produced major articles on J. Craig
Venter, the scientist-entrepreneur who broke from the public
science orthodoxy a few years ago and started a commercial race to
finish the treasure map. (Business Week, in its captain-of-industry
feature, declared a ``genome gold rush'' and explained its election
of Venter to cover-photo status this way: ``Well, Craig, you've
earned it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whether Venter's enterprise, the Celera Genomics group of PE
Corp., finishes first, or whether the $3 billion publicly financed,
international Human Genome Project somehow wins at the wire,
completion will be a significant milestone _ not only for molecular
biology, but for computer science. And for business, of course.
Stand by for the New Genomics to become the next big thing in the
New Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by extensive computer processing power, the genome
researchers have been engaged in what is essentially a giant
software project. Sequencing the human genome, as the task is
known, involves sifting through the 3 billion units of DNA at the
heart of every human cell to identify the 80,000 or so genes that
define all inheritable physical and behavioral traits. This
identification process is not the same as decoding, however. For
even after all those genes have been identified, each one still
needs to be translated to determine its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Think of each gene as a snatch of encrypted software _ a set of
instructions that tells cells which proteins to produce in order to
make, repair or regulate some part of the human body. To
researchers, each gene initially seems like a piece of encrypted
e-mail. Simply knowing that there's a gene in the In Box isn't
enough; somebody has to unscramble the code to understand what the
gene actually means.
</P>
<P>
   So this first phase is only a starting point. But eventually,
sequencing the human genome is expected to give medical researchers
the knowledge to devise new techniques for diagnosing, treating and
even preventing all sorts of diseases in which genetic differences
play a role _ whether purely physical afflictions like cancer or
mentally manifested ones like schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some useful data has emerged from this effort, as the
mappers have published various gene sequences _ the coded text of
individual genes. An early leader in translating genomic data into
actual drugs is Human Genome Sciences, a Rockville, Md., company
that is currently in human trials with two gene-based therapies.
One is meant to protect the body's blood-forming cells during
cancer chemotherapy; the other is being tested as a wound-healing
agent.
</P>
<P>
   How soon these, or other gene therapies, might reach the market
is hard to predict. But the business and investment worlds, eager
to find the next hot market, are prepared to celebrate the gene
kings in the same way they've feted the Internet titans.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the chairman and chief executive of
Human Genome Sciences, William A. Haseltine, recently shared a
stage with Steve Case, chairman of America Online, at a dinner held
by the prestigious Economic Club of New York. The organizers,
presumably, have already figured out that the New Economics and the
New Genomics are adjacent steps on technology's ever-ascending
spiral staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine allowed as much. After Case delivered a speech about
the Net as ``a massive social phenomenon,'' Haseltine took the
podium and said, ``I couldn't do the work I do today without the
advances that have been made in computation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Haseltine, speaking without notes, laid out a number of
issues in genomics that _ even if he didn't explicitly draw the
parallels _ have their computing and Internet counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the harnessing of genes and proteins as a new
medicine, whose benefits he described in new-economic terms as ``a
new and scalable form of productivity.'' He spoke of the
public-policy goal of ensuring ``uniform access to the new
medicine,'' a phrase that echoes the goals of advocates who seek
equal Internet access for all.
</P>
<P>
   And, making clear that whether the code is digital or genetic,
business is business, Haseltine argued that ``protection of
intellectual property in its multiple forms is crucial.'' In this
newest chapter of the Information Age, the data continues to have
intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   A reason Venter and Celera hurried to complete their own human
genome database was so they could sell that information to other
researchers. Likewise, Haseltine, a former business partner of
Venter's, has sought to stake a commercial claim by patenting his
company's gene work. So far, Human Genome Sciences has applied for
more than 7,500 human-gene patents and has been granted more than
130.
</P>
<P>
   To his Economic Club audience, Haseltine patiently explained
that gene patents make no ownership claim on each individual's
personal DNA chemistry. The patents, he said, cover only specific,
applied knowledge about human genes. He said such knowledge
resulted from considerable money and effort, which would not be
expended without the lure of a commercial payoff.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded reasonable. And it sounded like the same
capitalism that has long driven advances in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Haseltine addressed the Economic Club only a few
hours after a federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft. Is it
irony, or symmetry, that genomics is reaching its big milestone at
the same historic moment that the government wants to break up the
world's most powerful software company?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is being censured for the way it has wielded market
power over the desktop operating system. Will some other company,
someday, be investigated for its market power over the genome _ the
basic human operating system?
</P>
<P>
   The one certainty is that the gold rush is on. Business Week
says so. And now, any Nasdaq investor who saw selling pet food over
the Internet as the apotheosis of technology should get ready: Be
prepared to gaze in slack-jawed wonder at what computers and DNA
software compilers are about to let us in for.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea came to an
official halt Sunday, closing two years of fighting in one of the
fiercest wars in Africa, as the nations signed a preliminary
cease-fire and agreed to work toward a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The two foreign ministers, who did not speak to each other
during the negotiations, shook hands after the 15-point document
was signed in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Haile Woldansae, the Eritrean foreign minister, said it was
``the first concrete step toward peace between the two countries
after a useless war.'' His Ethiopian counterpart, Seyoum Mesfin,
called the agreement ``historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Woldansae's characterization of the war as ``useless'' has often
been used to describe a border war that has crippled two
economically developing countries and killed tens of thousands of
its young men and women. It has also uprooted hundreds of thousands
of Eritreans and destroyed, for perhaps many years, the once-close
relationship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   The document signed Sunday is not a final cease-fire, but it
does provide detailed plans for disengaging the two armies and
devising a lasting solution. Most important, the plan calls for
creation of a 15.5-mile buffer zone along the border, all in
Eritrean territory, acknowledging Ethiopia's gains on the
battlefield since the latest round of fighting began on May 12. But
in a concession to Eritrea, its officials and citizens may return
to the buffer zone as negotiations progress on the final accord.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for U.N. peacekeepers to patrol parts of the
zone, as well as the main areas of contention. These areas are
likely to include Zalambessa, Bure _ to the east, and Badme, where
the hostilities began in May 1998. Eritrea has claimed pockets
along the 620-mile border as its own, under colonial treaties, and
had moved troops into those zones. They have been pushed back by
Ethiopian troops, though, in the last month of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has not yet approved a peacekeeping mission
and so there are no estimates of its size, duration or timing. But
this is a time of increasing skepticism about peacekeeping missions
in Africa. Peacekeepers were taken hostage in Sierra Leone, and a
cease-fire in Congo _ where such a mission has already been
approved but no soldiers deployed _ has been repeatedly violated by
all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lake, the American former national security adviser who
helped broker Sunday's agreement, echoed remarks by other foreign
officials that this proposed peacekeeping mission was different
from others. He noted that the armies of the two participating
countries were ``highly disciplined'' and that both nations'
leaders were committed to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that each of them _ repeatedly over the last
two years and again today _ said they were very serious once they
signed about implementing it,'' Lake said in a telephone interview
Sunday from Algiers, where he attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a very strong reason to believe this will not
be like other cessation of hostility agreements on other parts of
the continent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important element of the final peace accord will be the
demarcation of the border _ which was never settled when Eritrea,
for a generation the northernmost province of Ethiopia, gained its
independence in 1993. The question will be settled technically by
U.N. cartographers, using old colonial treaties and other
documents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like other officials, Lake portrayed Sunday's signing as a ray
of hope for Africa, at a time when the continent is torn by so much
conflict, in places like Sierra Leone, Angola, Congo and Burundi.
He and others noted that the accord was largely the product of the
Organization for African Unity, which will also oversee its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   And if the peace accord works, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which had
been seen generally as two stable nations with promising economies,
may be back on track for economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing stereotype that what Africans do is kill
each other,'' he said. ``That simply is not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that most Africans want to live in peace, just
like most Americans and everyone else,'' he added. ``I worry that
the stereotype to the contrary is going to damage our ability to
work with them in the coming years. So I hope this is one ripple of
reality against this stereotypical current.''

 &HT;    BASHAR ASSAD CHOSEN TO HEAD COUNTRY'S RULING PARTY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Syria's ruling Baath Party unanimously chose
Bashar Assad to be its leader Sunday, giving him an expected but
important boost toward replacing his father as the country's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's appointment as the party's secretary general continued
the almost mechanical execution of political steps meant to ensure
a smooth transfer of power in this country of about 17 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The move also places him on the party's Regional Command
Council, a membership required of all presidents.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad, 69, died June 10 after nearly 30 years in
power. Though he had chronic health problems, the death came
suddenly, and Syrian leaders quickly made clear that Bashar Assad
would ascend to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is just 34 years old and was training in ophthalmology in
London until 1994. That was when his older brother, Basil, who had
been groomed for the presidency, died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's leaders have been quick to fortify Assad's rise to
power. After his father's death, the parliament rushed to remove
the constitutional requirement that presidents be at least 40 years
old. Then, Assad was appointed head of the army.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Hafez Assad's death, the Baath Party had been
expected at this meeting to give his son his first government post,
likely vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which has dominated Syrian politics for nearly 40
years, is rooted in socialist ideology and largely followed the
dictates of the late president. It had not held a party congress
for 15 years before this week.
</P>
<P>
   In another move Sunday, the party voted reaffirm the late
president's stand on making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   That position is based on Syria recovering all of the Golan
Heights, a strategic highland that Israel captured in 1967. Peace
talks with Israel broke off in January, and U.S. officials have
been trying to restart them.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his political beliefs, Assad's positions on peace
with Israel are little known accept that they track those of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began preparing for the presidency, Assad has headed a
campaign to root out government corruption. He also appeared to
support, through his attendance at conferences and heading of
special committees, business reform and the spread of modern
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's economy is rife with government monopolies and
inefficiencies. Internet use is limited by a system of licensing
and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Baath Party may officially nominate Assad as their
presidential candidate on Monday, repeating a move already taken by
the Syrian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament may appoint him president June 25, and Syrian
voters are expected to ratify that choice in a referendum around
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Assad can hold power remains to be seen. Before his
father, Syrian politics were characterized by turmoil, coups and
short-lived governments.
</P>
<P>
   Assad will face resistance from those in power opposed to his
anti-corruption campaign. He will also have to win the respect of
those skeptical of the dynastic handing over of power from father
to son.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Assads are from the minority Alawite religious
sect, and Assad could face resistance from the Sunni Muslim
majority, which arose against his father in the past.

ONE ASPECT OF MESSAGES ON THE INTERNET TO BE DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mass.) By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the explosive popularity of instant-messaging programs
on the Internet, it became apparent last week that one facet of the
service may not be instant at all: It may be a year or more before
users of competing instant-messaging services can send missives to
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than a year of wrangling between America Online,
the industry leader by far, and its competitors, the fate of this
service, which permits users to send messages over the Internet
that quickly pop up on a recipient's screen, remains mired in
technical and political snags.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday was the deadline for proposals to an industry
committee charged with creating standards to permit instant
messages to be sent among users of the dozen or so competing
programs. Six proposals came in. But the one that carried the most
immediate weight was from AOL, which controls roughly 90 percent of
the instant-messaging traffic and which has stymied efforts of
competitors seeking to communicate with its 90 million
instant-messaging users.
</P>
<P>
   Given the growing popularity of instant messaging, which now has
between 100 million and 120 million users all told, the stakes are
profound for consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors have asked the federal government to look into
AOL's dominant market position in instant messaging as part of its
review of the company's proposed merger with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers say that the current situation, in which
there is no interoperability, could be compared to a telephone
system in which different services, like Sprint and AT&AMP;T, would be
unable to place telephone calls to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the initial reaction from competitors to AOL's
proposal submitted Thursday was cautious skepticism, but in the
days following it has become more hostile. AOL's rivals contend
that its proposal is general, providing little technical detail or
time frame about how and when a standard will be achieved _ in
effect, the proposal is a stall tactic.
</P>
<P>
   And some proponents of interoperability say it may now be more
than a year before instant message users from different services
will be able to communicate if they wait for a protocol to be
created.
</P>
<P>
   The submission, ``is very high-level and esoteric,'' said Ross
Bagully, chief executive of Tribal Voice Inc., an instant messaging
service based in Denver. ``There is no hard time frame of what AOL
will do and when,'' he said, adding, ``It could be 18 months before
there is interoperability.''
</P>
<P>
   The standards were proposed to the Internet Engineering Task
Force, a group in which participation is voluntary and findings are
nonbinding. V.J. Saraswat, co-chairman of the instant messaging
committee, said AOL's 18-page submission is a ``document of value''
that requires serious analysis. But he conceded that the deadline
was for specific technical protocols, while AOL only sent in a
framework for creating protocols.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AOL said it published issues that it says must be
addressed as part of any solution that will let hundreds of
millions of Internet users send instantaneous messages. Among its
concerns, AOL says it wants to safeguard security for its users by,
for example, ensuring ways they can block messages from senders
they deem undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely sincere'' about achieving interoperability,
said Tricia Primrose, an AOL spokeswoman. She said that the
document submitted Thursday was ``a significant first step toward
developing detailed protocols.''
</P>
<P>
   If this debate sounds familiar _ with AOL saying privacy and
security must be guarded, and competitors saying AOL is stalling to
prevent true interoperability _ that is because it has raged for
more than a year. Last summer, AOL was battling with competitors,
including Microsoft, which used technical loopholes to contact AOL
instant messaging users, causing AOL to accuse competitors of
hacking into its system and to continually patch those holes.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth has been a theme during the year. In fact,
Odigo, a New York-based messaging service with 800,000 members,
said that seven times this year it had found a way to direct
messages from its users to AOL users, but that each time it had
been blocked, including twice in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the debate has taken on newfound impetus in light of AOL's
proposed merger with Time Warner. Competitors, including Tribal
Voice, have asked for an investigation from federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are political, but they also touch a growing number
of users, both individual and corporate. Forrester Research, a
market research group in Cambridge, Mass., reports that 36 percent
of Fortune 1000 companies use instant messaging, known in the
industry as ``IM,'' and project the number will grow to 46 percent
by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Navi Radjou, an analyst with electronic business applications
for Forrester, said the debate is taking on newfound significance
because of the business users, noting that ``the next battleground
in the IM space is the corporate world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Radjou said that, even under an optimistic scenario, it will be
March or April of next year before there are protocol standards to
permit interoperability. This analysis was echoed by Saraswat, from
the task force, who projected it will take six months to a year for
his group to come up with a protocol gleaned from the various
proposals, including submissions from a group at Fujitsu and one
from a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Bagully, from Tribal Voice, said that if the industry truly
was committed to reaching interoperability, it could do so ``in a
couple of months.'' And, in fact, he said a number of AOL's top
competitors are in discussions to open their own systems to one
another, which, he said the group could do ``in a heartbeat'' if
everyone was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, people within the industry said that if AOL or other
companies were willing to embrace a temporary solution, they could
enable messages to be sent to one another in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Avner Ronen, chief executive of Odigo, said simple
interoperability could be achieved almost immediately, but creating
fully functional systems could take a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions that would have to be answered are not just
the technical specifications of how to enable communication, but
also the privacy and security safeguards the industry decides are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires the cooperation of all companies,'' Ronen said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will surround a slow-moving front
stretched from the Mississippi Valley to southern Virginia. A few
of the thunderstorms will cause flooding as the front undercuts and
lifts very humid air. The risk for flooding will be heightened from
northeast Texas to southern Missouri, where a jet stream
disturbance passing overhead will augment the ascent of the sultry
air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Southeast will be partly sunny and humid, with
isolated thunderstorms, while clouds depart the Northeast and Ohio
Valley as high pressure directs drier air into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty breezes from the south will draw higher humidity into the
Plains, setting the stage for late-day storms in northern sections.
The Pacific states will be dry and very warm, though onshore
breezes will bring patchy clouds and cooler air to the coast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: IT'S THE HUMIDITY
</P>
<P>
   On a warm day, more than 10 million sweat glands moisten the
human body with as much as two quarts of water per hour. As
perspiration evaporates from the surface of the skin, the skin is
cooled. This evaporation of sweat is the body's main mechanism for
dissipating heat. However, the rate of evaporation slows as
humidity increases. When humidity and heat are high, body moisture
begins to collect on the skin in beads, with little or no
evaporation taking place. At this stage, the body's cooling system
is operating at very low efficiency, leaving people feeling very
uncomfortable. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Much has changed in Mexico to make the current
campaign for the presidency the fairest and most competitive in the
country's history.
</P>
<P>
   The media have been opened up to broadcast free-wheeling
debates, better election monitoring has reduced the governing
party's margin for fraud, and for the first time it looks as if an
opposition candidate may actually be given a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is what opposition leaders say are the
governing party's long-entrenched practices of vote-buying,
coercion and doling out of pork. In fact, some election observers
say, such things are worse than ever, perhaps because in a
stunningly close race in which so much else has been altered, they
remain the party's most reliable, time-tested tools.
</P>
<P>
   Instances of irregularities, from the artful to the absurd, have
been documented all across Mexico in recent days as the election,
now just two weeks away, approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In one Yucatan village last week, the state governor himself
handed out 1,003 washing machines to poor women.
</P>
<P>
   In Tabasco state, officials appeared suddenly with disaster
funds _ delayed since flooding in October _ and paid homeowners who
support the governing party $600, and paid those who support the
opposition $200.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare mothers and corn farmers in 13 states have reported
being told that they will be cut off from cash payments unless they
pledge to vote for Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the
governing party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, civil servants from a string of government
ministries and state-run institutions, like the national oil
company Pemex, have stepped forward to complain that superiors are
threatening to dismiss them unless they campaign for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen a campaign before this in which such vast
resources have been spent to buy votes, and such tremendous efforts
made to twist voters' arms,'' said Rogelio Gomez Hermosillo,
director of Alianza Civica, a watchdog group that has monitored 50
federal and state elections in Mexico since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's tactics have provided an extraordinary demonstration
of the still-robust powers of the aparato, the nationwide machinery
of political control exercised by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party during its seven decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Recent election polls have shown Labastida to be locked in a
close race with Vicente Fox, a former governor who has attracted
opposition votes from across the political spectrum. Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, a leftist former mayor of Mexico City, is running a
distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and Fox have been trading bitter attacks, but last week
the deluge of vote-buying reports so angered both men that they
signed a pact to coordinate efforts to prevent further vote
coercion.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, accusing the PRI of ``blackmailing citizens for
votes,'' warned he might not accept the election results as
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of incidents of voter coercion, many with an eerily
similar ring suggesting a systematic effort coordinated from Mexico
City, have been documented by a congressional elections oversight
committee, and by at least three independent watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some hard-line PRI leaders have acknowledged that a central PRI
strategy has been to persuade officials who administer government
social programs to use them to benefit the Labastida campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's social programs are PRI programs, and
we're going to use them to win the presidency,'' Manuel Bartlett, a
former interior minister working in the Labastida campaign, said
last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Marco Provencio, a spokesman, said President Ernesto Zedillo
had insisted that members of his government obey laws barring
officials from using government resources on behalf of candidates.
``If opposition parties believe programs have been used in illegal
ways, let them turn over their evidence to the authorities,''
Provencio said.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional committee monitoring the presidential campaign
has received 86 complaints about the use of government resources to
benefit mostly PRI candidates. It has drawn up a dozen complaints
for presentation to the special prosecutor for election crimes,
said Rep. Elodia Gutierrez, the congresswoman from Fox's National
Action party who heads the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buying of votes has been flagrant,'' she said last week.
But in an interview, she held out little hope that officials
suspected of electoral crimes would be charged.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor, who has had law enforcement
responsibilities in dozens of elections since his office was
founded in 1994, has never indicted a single person on charges of
vote-buying, vote-coercion or diverting government resources to a
political campaign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In several recent cases, law enforcement officials in states
governed by the PRI have themselves been discovered in what
opposition leaders say are election-related crimes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Merida, Yucatan, officials at the local headquarters of Fox's
campaign, after hearing noises, waited at night with a videocamera.
They filmed uniformed Yucatan state police officers on their roof,
tampering with telephone wires. Other intruders had penetrated into
the National Action Party's offices.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alberto Castaneda, the party's state president, filed a
complaint, but the Yucatan authorities brushed the matter aside,
saying the police had been investigating a burglary, Castaneda said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, another state controlled
by the PRI, doctors from the state attorney general's office handed
out medicines, confiscated by the state police from criminals, to
voters in poor neighborhoods who agreed to sign a pledge to vote
for PRI candidates, according to a complaint filed by Rep.
Guadalupe Sanchez, a congresswoman from Cardenas' party.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of abuses began emerging in May, shortly after
Labastida stumbled in the first candidate debate. To strengthen his
faltering campaign, he met with dozens of federal officials and
state governors to plead for help.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides said public servants would campaign only in
their free time, but subsequent events have suggested that many
bureaucrats responded to Labastida's call by virtually abandoning
official duties to campaign full time, often from their offices.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, senior officials from the System for the
Development of Families, a taxpayer-financed welfare agency, called
its 150 top bureaucrats to a meeting during working hours in an
auditorium at headquarters, Maria del Refugio Montoya, a senior
researcher at the agency, said in an interview. The bureaucrats
were told to organize gatherings with friends and neighbors at
which they were to present a Labastida video and elicit vote
pledges, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's supervisor ordered her to organize one of the
Labastida events. ``Do we have to do this?'' Montoya asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we have to _ or do you want to have problems?'' her
supervisor responded, Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Another civil servant to complain was Ramiro Berron, a senior
technician at Pemex, the government oil monopoly. Last week, he
said in a public letter to his colleagues at Pemex that he and
other employees had been ordered to campaign for Labastida using
government cars, telephones and other resources, on threat of
dismissal. He noted that civil service laws bar public servants
from using state resources for political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses are threatening to fire you, but don't be tricked
into committing crimes,'' his letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Progresa, which channels cash payments from the Social
Development Ministry to 2.6 million poor women, is the government
program used most systematically to favor the PRI, said Gutierrez,
the oversight committee chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Jarque, the secretary of social development, said last
week that his agency was working energetically to keep Progresa
free from political manipulation. A letter distributed to Progresa
beneficiaries reminded them that the program did not obligate them
to vote for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarque's two predecessors resigned from the Zedillo Cabinet
to work for Labastida, and this spring the senior official in
charge of Progresa's computerized list of beneficiaries also joined
the campaign. Progresa beneficiaries in dozens of villages in 13
states have since complained that they have been told by the
program's village-level organizers that unless they pledge to vote
for Labastida they will be cut from Progresa.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yucatan village of Cuzama, for instance, a Mayan mother
of four who receives a $106 government check every two months said
her neighborhood Progresa coordinator convoked a May 23 meeting at
which Labastida pamphlets were distributed to 80 women. The
coordinator, Gladys Arjona, told them to put their names and voter
identification numbers on a Labastida sign-up sheet, three who
attended said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't, you'll lose your Progresa,'' Arjona announced,
the three women said. Arjona, who lives in a house shaded by banana
trees, acknowledged that she was host for the Labastida meeting.
``But everything was voluntary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Uman, preparations began two days in
advance for the June 11 rally with Yucatan's governor, Victor
Cervera, at which he distributed 1,003 portable washing machines.
PRI supporters who had signed up to receive the washers were called
to city hall to make an $11 down payment and to turn over their
voter identification cards to a local PRI leader. The town's 200
town workers were told that they had to attend the governor's rally
or forfeit three days' pay, a municipal employee said.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the rally, the police blocked streets around
Uman's central plaza, and municipal workers unloaded the washers
from trucks, stacking them in front of city hall. After dark, PRI
squads fanned out through the town, splashing whitewash on walls
painted with Fox advertisements. At 8 a.m. Sunday, the governor's
convoy arrived, and Cervera officially handed out the washers, to
chants of ``Long Live the PRI!''

ONCE SEEN AS FOLLY, BRANCH DAVIDIAN'S LAWSUIT NOW A REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For years, the Branch Davidian wrongful-death lawsuit
seemed unlikely to amount to anything more than paper. The case
file is about as thick as 25 metropolitan phone books, a tower of
motions and countermotions once regarded as a monument to futility
by those who doubted the case would ever reach trial.
</P>
<P>
   But six years after the lawsuit was filed, the trial is
scheduled to open on Monday in U.S. District Court in Waco. Once
criticized as a bundle of anti-government conspiracies, the lawsuit
is now being taken very seriously. At its core lies the fundamental
question of whether the government was negligent in the deaths of
more than 80 Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993, when the sect's
Mount Carmel compound near Waco burned to the ground. The fire
started a tear-gas assault by federal agents after a 51-day
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is going to prove that our government can be held
accountable for its abuse of power,'' said Michael Caddell, the
lead lawyer for the Branch Davidian survivors and many of the
relatives of those who died. ``And that's what happened on April
19. It was an abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of the trial will be unusual, because there will
essentially be two trials. Several weeks ago, Judge Walter S. Smith
announced that he would impanel an ``advisory'' seven-person jury
to help him decide the case. Under that format, the judge could
ultimately overrule the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Smith said he would separate the most contentious
issue _ whether FBI agents fired gunshots into the compound on
April 19 _ into a separate hearing to be decided later by him
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a jury trial apparently unnerved the Justice
Department, which filed a motion asking the judge not impanel a
jury. But Smith said he had decided on a jury in response to the
national attention on the case.
</P>
<P>
   He has limited the jury's role, however, to deciding whether the
government was negligent. The judge said he would determine damages
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidian controversy has cast a pall over the Justice
Department since Feb. 28, 1993, when a gunfight broke out after
federal agents tried to raid Mount Carmel and serve a warrant on
the group's leader, David Koresh, on weapons charges. Four agents
with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms were killed that
day, as were six Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the standoff, Koresh refused the government's order
to surrender. The Mount Carmel compound caught fire after
government agents began pumping tear gas into the structure from
tanks and with projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   As ordered by Smith, the jury will consider five central issues:
Did government agents use excessive force on Feb. 28? Was the FBI
negligent in failing to have fire trucks ready on April 19? Did the
tanks battering the compound serve to spread the fire? Did FBI
agents fire gunshots into the compound on April 19? And did FBI
supervisors at the scene disobey orders from the Justice
Department?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, one of the lead lawyers for the government,
said blame for the deaths of the Branch Davidians rested solely
with the group's leader, Koresh. The government plans to introduce
photographs of the huge cache of weapons stockpiled by the Branch
Davidians as evidence of Koresh's provocative intentions, and
remind the jury of his refusal to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy that happened at Waco was brought about by David
Koresh, who considered himself to be a messiah who was predicting
the end of the world would come about in a violent conflict with
the government,'' Bradford, the U.S. attorney in Beaumont, said in
an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the government had ``acknowledged that there were
things that should have been done differently,'' a point emphasized
by hearings in Congress and critical internal investigations. But,
he added: ``It's one thing to say that things may not have been
done perfectly. It's another thing to said that the government
either intentionally or negligently caused those people's deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the first thing he intended to tell the jury was
that he did not plan to defend Koresh. Caddell said his strategy
would be to emphasize the women and children who died at Mount
Carmel, not the men, many of whom were firing at federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to portray FBI supervisors at the scene as so angry
during the standoff that frustration drove them to begin
demolishing the building with the tanks on April 19, defying the
orders of Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to prove that the government is 100 percent
responsible, and I don't believe that,'' Caddell said in an
interview. ``Clearly, David Koresh and the Branch Davidian
leadership had some responsibility for what happened. But clearly
the government had some responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether FBI agents fired into the compound, an
accusation the government has consistently denied, may hinge on a
comparison between an aerial infrared surveillance video taken on
April 19 and a video filmed earlier this year during a simulation,
which was ordered by Smith. The two sides have disagreed if flashes
on the video of April 19 represent gunfire or merely reflections
from water and debris near the compound.
</P>
<P>
   An initial analysis of the simulation supported the government's
belief that the flashes were not gunfire, but Caddell has disputed
the findings. He said depositions by two of the experts who
analyzed the videos disclosed major problems with the way the
simulation was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   The jury trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and the
hearing on gunfire could begin in August. The lawsuit, though, does
not signal an end to the Branch Davidian controversy. Last fall,
Reno appointed former Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., as an
independent special counsel to re-examine the government's role
after new evidence showed that FBI agents had fired pyrotechnic
tear-gas canisters, capable of starting a fire, into Mount Carmel
on April 19. Previously, the FBI had steadfastly denied using such
potentially explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell plans to argue that the tear-gas canisters started the
fire. The government had long maintained that audiotapes made
inside the compound suggest that Koresh ordered his followers to
set the blaze as part of a suicide pact.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's investigation is not expected to conclude until after
the civil trial ends. Bradford, for one, hopes the lawsuit will
bring an end to the Branch Davidian controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have learned everything we can know about this,''
he said. ``Hopefully, this will be the end of it, and we can put
this behind us and move on.''

BROAD-BRUSH HOLLYWOOD SATIRE COULD USE A MORE SKILLFUL HAND 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Straight-Jacket,'' a comedy by Richard Day, is set
in Hollywood in the 1950s, a setting it uses to suggest a parallel
between anti-gay bias and the House Un-American Activities
Committee. The show, which opened Sunday at Playhouse 91 in New
York, concerns a gay matinee idol who, to keep up appearances, is
coerced by the head of a movie studio into marrying a ditzy
secretary; at the same time the McCarthyites are threatening to
shut down the studio unless a big-name star confesses to being a
Communist.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of loopy, contrived setup that a Capraesque touch,
sophisticated and warmhearted, might exploit to advantage. But Day,
a first-time playwright, has created a dull-witted script that
exhausts any sympathy one might feel for his characters long before
they are declared to live happily ever after. Compounding the
problem, Day, a television producer and writer by trade, has
directed his own script here, employing an unwieldy, twin-turntable
set by Ray Recht, and a pacing that emphasizes exit lines before
each of the many scene changes, as if the show were about to cut to
a commercial. Gail Brassard's vivid costumes stand out as
anomalously bright.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the plot do not warrant critical recounting.
Suffice it to say that the intention is broad satire, which takes
the form of mere exaggeration, and that a celebrity's vanity, an
innocent girl's naivete, a mogul's corruption, an agent's cynicism
and a love object's good heart are pounded to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist, Guy Stone (played by John Littlefield, who was
cast, evidently, for his resemblance to Rock Hudson), is the
embodiment of sex-obsessed promiscuity, which is communicated with
a parade of smutty double-entendres and bluntly suggestive
embraces. His wife, Sally (Carrie Preston), believes Guy's sudden
declaration of love even though he has ignored her entirely until
then, and she's blind to his homosexuality until she finds dirty
magazines and an obscene sex toy hidden in the bedroom armoire. Her
every aesthetic _ in clothing, home design, movies and music _ is
held up to ridicule for its conventional artlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The studio executive (Mal Z. Lawrence), a manipulative penny
pincher, is a Jew in hiding; he's changed his name to Goldbergini
(yuk yuk), which serves only to illustrate how ham-handed attempts
to send up foolish bias end up reinforcing it instead. And Rick
(Adam Greer), the writer (and Communist _ such complications!) whom
Guy falls for with no perceivable provocation, is wont to say
things like, ``If you told me two months ago that the person
keeping my faith in humanity alive would be Guy Stone. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   You can't help feeling for the actors, who are hard pressed to
charm. With the exception of Jackie Hoffman, a veteran of Second
City, the Chicago improvisational troupe, whose practiced comic
hyperbole surfaces in her role as the agent, the cast seems
perilously close to suffocation by stereotype. At one point Rick is
at work on a new script, and Guy, looking over his shoulder,
counsels him not to use the word ``sex''; the studio censors won't
allow it. But Rick is a reluctant screenwriter, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play,'' he tells Guy. ``You can say whatever you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, 'tis true.

   CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ By relaxing rules and applying only a
spotty enforcement of travel restrictions, the Clinton
administration is opening Cuba to American travelers at a rate not
seen in more than 40 years. While administration officials deny
that the increased travel is intended to undermine the 38-year-old
embargo against Cuba, the new flow has given rise to a flurry of
business, personal and political contacts and there is a renewed
push in some circles _ both Democratic and Republican _ to relax
the commercial boycott, one of the last relics of the increasingly
distant Cold War. By Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ Much has changed in Mexico to
make the current race for the presidency the fairest and most
competitive in the country's history. What has not changed,
opposition and election officials say, is the ruling party's
long-entrenched system of vote-buying and coercion. 1700 words. By

<P>
   BUSH-BIO-III (New Haven, Conn.) _ Born at the earliest fringe of
the baby boom, Bush was pressed during his years at Yale to take
sides in the great battles then unfolding over politics, civil
rights, drugs and music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those
upheavals, but when forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the
values and ideals established by his parents' generation. Unlike
others of his generation, like Clinton or Gore, Bush never wore his
hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with existentialism or
cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his parents (instead of
hard rock music, he listened to soul). Even today, Bush thunders in
his stump speeches against boomer-style self-indulgence and appeals
for a ``responsibility era'' that in some respects sounds like the
1950s; he likes values as clean-cut as his hair. 4000 words. By
Nicholas D. Kristof.

   LOS-ALAMOS-SECURITY (Los Alamos, N.M.) _ The government was
already facing hurdles in its efforts to prosecute a scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, but last week's disclosures that two hard drives filled
with highly sensitive weapons data had inexplicably vanished have
potentially made it far more difficult for prosecutors in what had
once been described as a major national security case. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has insisted from the time he was indicted
last year that security breaches at the laboratory are common, and
that the kind of downloading he did -- moving classified data, in
the open, from a secure to unsecured computer, then downloading it
to tapes -- was done frequently by other experts protecting data
from an unreliable computer system. 1500 words. By James Sterngold.

in New York's archdiocese. An installation Mass scheduled for

notoriously rambunctious fraternity, and with the Christmas
holidays approaching, he and some of his buddies had declared
themselves the ``decorating committee.'' They took off for a
festive shopping street, where Bush spotted the wreath in a hotel _
and stole it.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the perfect crime. Bush later recalled that he and
his friends had perhaps had a few beers and were loud and
boisterous. In addition, a police car was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested Bush and charged him with disorderly
conduct. Eventually the charges were dropped, but the episode
underscored Bush's path through the uproar of the late 1960s: At a
time when many university students risked arrest for their
vociferous political protests, Bush broke the law not out of
principles but for a prank. Others denounced the police as
``pigs,'' while Bush instinctively stood with the establishment, at
the same time that he casually and apparently drunkenly breached
its law.
</P>
<P>
   Born at the earliest fringe of the baby boom, Bush was pressed
in his years at Yale, 1964 to 1968, to take sides in the great
battles then unfolding over politics, civil rights, drugs and
music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those upheavals, but when
forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the values and ideals
established by his parents' generation.
</P>
<P>
   In short, while some students took to the barricades, Bush took
to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others of his generation like Bill Clinton or Al Gore,
Bush never wore his hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with
existentialism or cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his
parents (instead of hard rock music, he listened to soul).
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Bush thunders in his stump speeches against
boomer-style self-indulgence and appeals for a ``responsibility
era'' that in some respects sounds like the 1950s; he likes values
as clean-cut as his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a rabble-rouser of sorts, but only in the high-spirited
way that fraternity boys a generation earlier had swallowed
goldfish or sat on flagpoles. For all the buffeting that late-night
television has given Bush over questions of drug use, he was in
most respects a very conventional young man, and classmates say
they do not recall him ever using marijuana or other illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale years can help address one of the fundamental questions
often raised by critics of Bush: Is he smart enough to be
president?
</P>
<P>
   The answer among those who knew him best is overwhelming and
indignant _ absolutely. Many friends are angry that people even ask
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is very smart,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a former
special counsel to President Clinton and a supporter of Al Gore, as
well as a fraternity brother of Bush at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion of lightness is totally missing the point. There
are many smart people, intellectually smart as well as
street-smart, who don't have the energy or motivation at times to
act smart, but that doesn't mean they're not smart. There are times
when George coasted through Yale courses or through exams or seemed
overly facetious. But don't mistake that for not being
intellectually acute.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Bush is a low-wattage leader seems to be based
on two factors. First, Bush never was a strong student. His
transcript at Yale, leaked to The New Yorker, shows that he was a
solid C student.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Bush is determinedly nonintellectual. He never seems to
want to play with ideas and hold them up to the light; at parties
he drops the names of baseball teams, not Kierkegaard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree that he's not contemplative or reflective,''
said Michael M. Wood, a friend at Yale and at Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass. ``He's not a guy who would go off by himself
thinking of something. He's more likely to be hiding in a tree to
jump down on somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush rose to be president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
This was a significant achievement, and those who came before and
after him as president did well in the business world, largely
because of the same people skills that propelled them to the top of
DKE.
</P>
<P>
   For a leading presidential candidate, Bush has an unusually
testy relationship with the Eastern establishment, even though he
also has an unusually intimate relationship with it. His
grandparents on both sides were card-carrying members of that
establishment, yet ever since he showed up at Yale as a freshman in
1964, Bush has resolutely cultivated anti-intellectualism and
chafed at what he describes as the arrogance of liberal
intellectual elitists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tension with what he sees as an arrogant Eastern elite,
and his perception of himself as outside it, seem to have arisen
initially from the clash of generations that occurred while he was
at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Bush entirely subscribed to his parents' and grandparents' view
of absolute and immutable values, of privilege balanced by duty.
But at Yale this solid, straightforward world turned upside down. A
moral universe of stark blacks and whites became colorized,
ambiguous and, for young George, disorienting.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates began to feel guilty about their privilege, angry at
their parents, distrustful of business and defiant at the system
itself. For somebody like George W., who was entirely comfortable
in his own skin, all this guilt and upheaval were incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman Brewster Jr., the legendary president of Yale, moved to
transform the university by admitting women beginning in 1968 and
by restructuring admissions so that young men like George W. Bush _
mediocre students who were children of alumni _ would no longer be
admitted. Indeed, with his grades and college boards Bush might not
have been admitted if he had applied a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Young George watched wistfully from afar as his father, in the
different political universe of Texas, basked in public respect and
bounced back in 1966 to win a congressional seat and be named
president of the freshman class in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But as the elder Bush became more prominent as a Republican
congressman who supported the Vietnam War and opposed some civil
rights legislation, he also became a target of criticism at Yale,
which deeply offended young George.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's loyalty to his father in the Yale years was filial rather
than political. For a son of a politician, Bush was remarkably
oblivious of current affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Other undergraduates at the time _ like the future New York
governor George Pataki, the future Massachusetts senator John Kerry
and the future federal judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III _ were active
in campus politics, while at the law school the future senator
Joseph Lieberman was launching his own political career.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was the opposite kind of student: He never joined the
Yale Political Union and rarely spent time talking about civil
rights, the Vietnam War or other upheavals of the day.
</P>

 &UR; BC-BUSH-BIO-III-ABRIDGED-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; NEW HAVEN, Conn.: the day. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Race riots erupted in New Haven between Bush's junior and senior
years, anti-war ``teach-ins'' and protests multiplied, and students
burned draft cards. The upheaval may have left George W. Bush
uncomfortable, but friends remember him as cheerful, vigorously
involved in intramural sports at Davenport, his residential
college, and laughing with friends over beers. Roommates recall him
studying the class register and memorizing names of classmates, and
he clearly made friendships a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``George probably knew 1,000 of the 4,000 undergraduates at
Yale,'' said Betts. ``There probably was no one else who knew
200.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's junior year, he was admitted to Skull and Bones, a
secret society then made up of 15 of the most promising, talented
or socially prominent men in each class. There have been reports
that he was ``tapped'' by his father, who himself was a Bonesman,
but an outgoing senior and Bonesman, David Alan Richards,
acknowledges that it was he who tapped Bush that night.
</P>
<P>
   For a man like George W. who complains about elitism, Skull and
Bones was an odd group to enter. It was the epitome of exclusivity,
carefully choosing its members each year to undergo an elaborate
initiation procedure in a windowless ``tomb'' that only members
were allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   If entry into Skull and Bones opened Bush to accusations of
snobbery, it also meant association with a community of gifted
people with whom Bush would form lifelong friendships _ and Bush's
strategy at Yale was clearly to build up not a great transcript but
great friendships. It was also a perfectly reasonable strategy, for
one could argue that Yale graduates in the 1960s went further on
the networks they made than on the grades they earned.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly true of Bush. He was not quite John Belushi
in ``Animal House,'' but like many of his DKE fraternity brothers
he did manage what could politely be called a full life. For
starters, DKE was notorious for its rowdy weekend parties _
attended by Yale men and by women from nearby women's colleges _ in
which alcohol was so plentiful that party-goers periodically threw
up or passed out.
</P>
<P>
   So young George Bush floated along through the turbulence of the
1960s and into the 1970s, unsure about what he might do in life.
When he received his Yale diploma in 1968, he had third-rate
grades, second-rate accomplishments and no firm career prospects.
There was just one area where he had excelled: He had a huge number
of very close friends, and long after course grades were forgotten,
those friends would stand by him, reach into their pockets for him
and help propel him into politics.

DISAPPEARANCE OF HARD DRIVES AT LOS ALAMOS MAY HELP LEE'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Emboldened by the latest security scandal at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory and several other breaks, the
lawyers for Wen Ho Lee, the scientist accused of mishandling
nuclear weapons secrets, plan an aggressive courtroom assault in
coming weeks that could all but decide the case before it goes to
trial. But should the judge rule against them, the strategy could
also create serious risks for Lee's defense.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the government replaced its lead prosecutor with
another who is well regarded, but lacks experience in these kinds
of trials, and the federal district judge who had been overseeing
the case withdrew and assigned it to a judge whom the defense
regards as more independent-minded.
</P>
<P>
   But the unexplained disappearance, and then suspicious
reappearance last week of two computer hard drives believed to
contain nuclear secrets amounted to a potential legal
``bombshell,'' according to one government official involved in
Lee's case.
</P>
<P>
   Although not directly related to Lee, the security breach would
seem to bolster his contentions that security at the laboratory has
long been lax and that scientists there have routinely moved
classified material without witnesses or signing logs, and that
doing so was not necessarily a sign of malice, just expedience or
perhaps carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' another government official conceded. ``You
have to think about how this would affect a jury using common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers are expected to use the episode involving the hard
drives in their battle to get Lee, 60, released on bail, perhaps
within the next few weeks. He has been in jail in Santa Fe, N.M.,
under unusually harsh conditions since his arrest and indictment in
December. The government insists that he poses a grave national
security risk and that even a seemingly benign remark in the
presence of a foreign agent could enable a transfer of data that
could, as one witness for the government said at an earlier
hearing, ``shift the global balance of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the people who was most strident in voicing such
concerns was Stephen Younger, the head of the nuclear weapons
program at Los Alamos; he was also among the six people placed on
leave after it was disclosed that the computer hard drives not only
had vanished, but had been missing for more than three weeks before
top government officials were notified.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is also likely to raise at a new bail hearing the
earlier disclosure that the mountain of data Lee downloaded was not
officially designated classified at the time it was transferred, as
the prosecutors have said, but carried a less restrictive
designation common for large volumes of scientific data called
``protect as restricted data,'' or PARD.
</P>
<P>
   The rules on handling PARD material are looser and, the defense
will argue, the exposure of such information would pose far less of
a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   This overall strategy failed at the last bail hearings in
January, but the defense is hoping the new information about the
classification of the data and the recent security lapse will
convince the judge that Lee is being improperly singled out and
deserves to be released on bail, even if he is placed under
restrictive conditions at his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the latest disclosures show that there are systemic
problems with the handling of sensitive information at Los Alamos,
and it points out the unfairness of scapegoating Dr. Lee for what
he did,'' said Mark Holscher, one of his lawyers. ``The information
that has now disappeared carried a far more sensitive
classification than the material Dr. Lee downloaded. There was just
an unjustified hysteria around the material he moved to an open
system.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lee's case has also been taken up by Asian-Americans, whose
leaders have complained that he is being prosecuted selectively
because he is Chinese-American, an accusation the government has
denied.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors would not comment on the latest developments
related to the case.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Further heartening the defense was the government's sudden
decision to bring in _ just before these crucial hearings _ a new
lead prosecutor, George A. Stamboulidis, an assistant U.S. attorney
on Long Island. He has had great success in prosecuting organized
crime and political corruption cases, but he has no background in
nuclear issues or national security matters.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was also not unhappy when the judge who had been
overseeing the case, John Edwards Conway, unexpectedly said he was
assuming senior status, a sort of semiretirement, and recused
himself from the case. It was assigned to Judge James A. Parker of
U.S. District Court. Parker denied Lee bail at the hearings in
January, but the defense regards him as more independent than his
predecessor in dealings with the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these developments, the defense is brimming with
confidence as it approaches the two coming hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's agenda for the hearings will involve efforts to
suppress the evidence gathered at Lee's home because of a faulty
warrant _ a tactic whose success, considered a long shot, could
cripple the prosecution _ and an even more important attempt to
introduce all the data Lee downloaded, equal to more than 400,000
pages, at his trial. This is being done under a special law for
dealing with classified information called the Classified
Information Procedures Act, or CIPA.
</P>
<P>
   John Cline, another of Lee's lawyers, has said the defense would
use the data to back up its claim that ``virtually all'' the
esoteric physics, testing and design information had already been
made public in academic journals and other forums, making its
transfer by Lee to an unsecure computer and portable computer tapes
a far more benign act.
</P>
<P>
   The government has called the information ``the crown jewels''
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a vast trove of information on how to
design more sophisticated weapons. So if the judge agrees with Lee,
and the defense prevails in the expected appeals, the government
will have to decide whether to permit the public exposure of the
information or drop the charges. Of course, the judge's denial of
the requests could undercut one of the pillars of Lee's defense.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third option: the judge could permit the defense to
introduce unclassified summaries of the data, or digests. But even
then, the vagueness of the summaries could prove a continuing
source of argument. If at any time during the trial a government
witness were to characterize the data Lee mishandled as crucial to
national security, the defense would be expected to demand the
introduction of the actual information in an effort to undercut
such claims.
</P>
<P>
   But this remains an extremely complex case filled with
uncertainties, which also include troubling questions potentially
damaging to Lee. He has not explained why, for instance, he
downloaded the storehouse of data to an unsecure computer and
easily portable computer tapes, nor has he provided firm evidence
of what happened to seven of the tapes that are missing. He said he
destroyed them, but has yet to prove it. And losses in both of the
coming hearings could deal a severe blow to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   About the only certainty is that both the defense the and
prosecution are pursuing risky, all-or-nothing strategies in a case
that could have far-reaching national security implications.
</P>
<P>
   The government, for instance, chose to charge Lee under a
little-used statute that could land him in prison for life if he is
convicted. But in doing so the government saddled itself with the
task of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Lee not only
illegally downloaded the classified data, but did so with the
intention of passing it to a third country, presumably China, even
though the government has also acknowledged that it has no evidence
such a transfer ever took place.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the defense has conceded that Lee violated some
government rules by downloading the material. But his lawyers say
they are fighting for a complete exoneration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a status conference last Monday, Parker asked Holscher, one
of Lee's lawyers, if there were any efforts to negotiate a plea
deal and if some sort of mediator might be brought in to facilitate
such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said that there had been some preliminary discussions
between the two sides, but that Lee is flatly rejecting pleading
guilty to any of the charges in his 59-count indictment or
accepting a sentence that would involve time in prison beyond the
months he has already served.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, Lee has endured better than the government
seems to have anticipated. Indeed, the government seems to have
believed that Lee, a respected scientist, would crack under the
bitter jail regimen _ he is segregated from other prisoners and can
meet with his family for just one hour a week, and then only with a
guard next to him. While people close to him say he has been
depressed at times, they say he is now busy and emotionally steady.
</P>
<P>
   He is writing a math text book and academic papers to keep his
mind busy, and most days he is driven from his jail in Santa Fe to
the new, austere federal courthouse here to work in a secure room
with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He wears a prison sweat shirt and sweat pants and is shackled
when moved to or from the windowless white van that transports him.
But he can still spend hours focused on preparing his case and
eating lunches brought by his lawyers rather than jail food,
factors that his family and lawyers say are preparing him for a
long and vigorous defense.

NORTH KOREA ACCUSES U.S. TROOPS OF INCREASING RISK OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Shattering the calm brought by last week's
historic reconciliation talks, North Korea on Sunday accused the
United States, which has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea, of
increasing the danger of war in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States imperialists pretend to be interested in
peace and detente in the Korean peninsula, but their actions only
result in increasing the danger of war and escalating tensions,''
said the Rodong Shinmun, the leading newspaper for the North Korean
Worker's Party.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation, which was carried by the North's overseas news
outlet, the Korean Central News Agency, came just two days after
the United States said that it had no plans to withdraw American
troops from South Korea, despite a landmark agreement between the
two Koreas to pursue peace and reunification.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has long demanded the removal of U.S. troops based
in the South, arguing that the Americans were preparing to go to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of the historic meeting last week, however,
Sunday's denunciation seemed intended to thrust the United States
firmly into the middle of the Korean peace process _ a position
that Washington has long sought to avoid, encouraging, instead,
that the Koreas negotiate their own peace.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has repeatedly tried to strike its own diplomatic
accords with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now that North and South are inching closer together, the United
States appears unwilling to give up its foothold in the Korean
peninsula, a development North Korea seems willing to exploit,
particularly in light of apparently increasing resistance among
South Koreans to having the Americans stay forever in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's pointed statement from North Korea did not specify how
the United States was increasing tensions in the peninsula.
However, the Communist country _ and its allies in China and Russia
_ object both to the strong American presence here and to American
plans for a missile defense shield that Washington says is
primarily intended to guard against attack from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence and defense officials say that North Korea
is developing its own long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear
weapons. North Korea is concerned, regional analysts say, that the
United States will share its missile defense system with
Washington's allies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea plans to use the issue of the troops and the
theater missile defense as a bargaining chip, which has the
potential to derail the entire process,'' of reconciliation between
the two Koreas, said Park Young Ho, director of the Center for
North Korean Society and Human Rights, a research institute funded
by the South Korean government. ``In the aftermath of the Korean
summit, North Korea is hardening its position through peace _ it
wants more positive security assurances from the United States,''
Park said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have welcomed the summit as a positive step
toward easing tensions and expressed support for further talks, but
they have ruled out discussion of withdrawing American troops as
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years of tension on the Korean peninsula will not
evaporate in one meeting,'' a spokesman for the National Security
Council, Lt. Col. David B. Stockwell, said Sunday. ``Any discussion
of troop strengths or any number of other issues will have to be
addressed as the process moves forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN on Saturday, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the summit should force a
reconsideration of the deployment of troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to consider it,'' he said. ``And after deliberation,
we can determine whether it's time to bring them out. It's too
early for anybody to say we ought to bring them out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first face-to-face meeting between Korean heads of state,
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il signed a broad pact last week calling for an end to
decades-long aggression on the peninsula, reuniting of families
separated by war, and economic and other ties.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to Seoul, South Korean President Kim declared
that the ``danger of war on the Korean peninsula had disappeared.''
But tensions remain high along the demilitarized zone, a heavily
fortified buffer that divides North and South. North Korea has
close to 1 million troops situated in the DMZ, while South Korea
has stationed half a million soldiers there, backed by the 37,000
American troops.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean military officials have long argued that their
troops alone cannot deter an invasion by North Korea. They also
depend on the United States for military intelligence. A recent
South Korean military report concluded that North Korea had
stockpiled between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of biological and chemical
weapons it planned to use in the event of an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Kim Dae-jung said that during the Pyongyang talks, he
had explained to Kim Jong Il exactly why a continued U.S. military
presence was necessary for regional security, but the officials
declined to say how the North Korean leader responded.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spends about $3 billion a year to maintain its
troops in South Korea. To help shoulder the burden, South Korea
pays the United States about $315 million a year in cash, and
provides $1.3 billion in tax breaks, free use of land and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls taken since the summit meeting indicate
that a majority of South Koreans surveyed believe that war is now
highly unlikely on the peninsula and that reunification will take
place within five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the summit meeting, there were growing voices of
opposition to U.S. military bases in South Korea. On Saturday,
hundreds of people demanding a withdrawal of U.S. troops clashed
with riot police near an American Air Force bombing range about 50
miles southwest of Seoul. The anti-American protests have increased
since early March when a U.S. fighter jet with engine trouble
dropped six bombs on the range. United States and South Korean
investigators said that the bombs caused no injuries, but local
villagers said that six people were hurt.

 &HT;    Closed N.C. theater mourned, but town hopes for revival
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTON, N.C. _ With arms crossed and dripping wet from the
swimming pool, sixth-grader Amanda Scott had just one thing to say
about life after the closing of the Mimosa Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be real boring,'' the 11-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 88 years, Morganton, N.C., has no movie
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The shock has worn down in the nearly three months since one of
the nation's largest theater chains, Carmike Cinemas Inc. of
Columbus, Ga., pulled out of town. But now with children out of
school, facing another seven weeks without a local theater, people
in Morganton, in Appalachia's foothills, are longing for a summer
tradition as familiar as fireflies after dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked to eat the popcorn and watch the movies,'' said Austin
Phipps, a freckle-faced 7-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Kids in the town 60 miles east of Asheville are tugging on
grown-ups to drive them to out-of-town movies. In Hickory, 20 miles
to the east, Carmike operates two theaters. One is a 12-screen
complex that since opening in 1998 has drawn some of Morganton's
moviegoers, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer can people, such as sisters Janelle and Michala
Michaux, walk to the Mimosa, the run-down theater across from Burke
County's courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rent movies, but that is not the same,'' said Melodie
Michaux, mother of Janelle, 14, and Michala, 12. ``The Mimosa was a
social gathering spot. Home is not as much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mimosa opened in 1939, with a flashy Art Deco facade in a
town built on native gray stone. Old-timers remember a quarter
covering admission, popcorn and a drink. Afterward, in the cool
evenings, they sat on the rock wall around the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   When it closed in late March, with a final showing of ``Snow
Day'' and ``The Next Best Thing,'' the two-screen Mimosa theater
smelled rank. The floor was sticky with spilled soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the joke of the town, but it was still a theater,''
said Sharon Jablonski, the city official in charge of redeveloping
Morganton's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The Mimosa charged $1.50 for admission to first-run movies that
arrived in Morganton a few weeks after their release. Carmike also
closed a two-screen theater on Morganton's bypass highway.
</P>
<P>
   But the pieces appear to be falling in place for a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Morganton officials and local developers are meeting today,
hoping to nail down a deal to preserve the Mimosa's historic facade
and lobby, gut the remainder and enlarge it for eight screens, an
arcade and a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   If the Morganton City Council approves loaning $500,000 to the
$2.6 million project, developer Brad Norvell said work could start
as soon as this week. It should be completed before another summer
rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to fathom no theater. We all grew up with them,''
Jablonski said. ``But we will certainly wind up with something much
nicer than we had.''

JOAO GILBERTO: A QUIET SIGH AT THE HEART OF BOSSA NOVA  

</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joao Gilberto began his Carnegie Hall concert on
Friday night in a rather agitated state, as did his audience. He
was an hour late getting to the stage. Looking a little bit like
Hunter S. Thompson in a pair of dark glasses, he explained that he
had locked his regular spectacles in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors and guesses that preceded this simple explanation
were proof of the enduring fascination with Gilberto, who has a
Greta Garbo-like reputation for hermitism and perfectionism. First
it was announced that President Clinton's motorcade had slowed down
traffic in Midtown Manhattan, making it hard for Gilberto to get to
the show. But word got around that he was staying at a hotel less
than a block away, and another part of the myth clicked in among
aficionados: since he reputedly doesn't go anywhere by foot, he
must have been snagged in traffic while simply riding around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   What's truly fascinating about Gilberto is the length of time he
has spent working on the same songs in the same way. His first
bossa novas, in the late 1950s, were perfect distillations lasting
two minutes or less; the clever pushing and pulling between his
stammering guitar rhythms and his voice, and the shrewd, quiet,
no-vibrato blankness of his singing style helped create a
languorous, innocent mood in popular culture shared by the Western
world: James Dean, ``The Red Balloon,'' Chet Baker, bossa nova.
</P>
<P>
   Since then his recorded output has remained small. And if he
isn't always playing his early repertory _ his first new album in
nine years, ``Joao Voz e Violao'' (Verve/Universal) contains seven
songs he hasn't recorded before _ the style of his music sounds to
all but the most trained ear like a continuing extension of his
first eureka moment.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday night's concert, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, he
lingered over this slowly widening battery of songs. He has written
only a few of them; the rest were composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim,
Carlos Lyra, Dorival Caymmi and other Brazilian songwriters of the
1950s. But Gilberto has rather radically personalized them all and
made them uniform, so that his versions are the ones you tend to
hear in your head.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's concert offered some famous numbers and withheld
others. (``Desafinado,'' ``Corcovado,'' ``Wave,'' ``Samba de Uno
Nota So,'' yes; ``The Girl From Ipanema,'' ``Chega de Saudade,''
``A Felicidade,'' no.) Unlike Willie Nelson or Louis Armstrong, two
other singers who worked out comparably original rhythmic concepts
in popular music, Gilberto uses barely any improvisation in his
performance. It is ritual by re-enactment, the purpose of which is
to arrive at a place of concentration where his tiniest vocal
susurations _ his pronunciation of P's and B's, the opening of his
lips to sing a line, the single word ``janela'' (window) _ become
jolts.
</P>
<P>
   Other than apologizing for being late and wearing dark glasses,
his only spoken words were requests to the sound crew for more bass
in his voice and more guitar. His concern paid off: By the song
``Estate,'' halfway through, the show was a seance.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto possesses the definition of a ``head'' voice, and much
of his singing has a nasal quality suggesting a muted trombone.
Almost conversationally, he connected phrases for several bars at a
time; there were the slightest changes here and there, like the
elongation of syllables in ``Corcovado'' and the rushing of lyrics
in ``One Note Samba'' that left the guitar lines lagging behind.
Positioning his picking hand above the strings, like a classical
guitarist, he kept a steady bass line with his thumb on the first
and third beat; the rest of his hand played syncopated havoc with
time.
</P>
<P>
   He played a set that included bossa novas, an older samba-cancao
(once sung in a 1940s croon but refigured to suit him), and George
Gershwin's `` 'S Wonderful.'' Gilberto is drawn toward poems of
observation and memory: on waiting for a woman (``Rosa Morena,'')
his home state of Bahia (Gilberto Gil's ``Eu Vim da Bahia''), the
ineffable effect of samba on ducks (``O Pato'') and humans (``Samba
da Minha Terra'').
</P>
<P>
   It's all a long sigh, originating from somewhere deep inside.
Toward the end of a nearly two-hour concert, the opening jitters
long gone, it seemed as if he had found his way to that place.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TSUU T'INA, Alberta _ As a boy during the Korean War, Samuel
Simon would ride his horse through buffalo grass to a prairie
bluff, where he watched Canadian war jets fly out of Calgary,
scream overhead and then unleash ground-shaking rockets on a
bombing range built on tribal land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would watch the planes flying over and shooting rockets;
they used old cars as targets,'' Simon, who is now 58, said
recently. ``But sometimes we would see two rockets and then just
one explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the same bluff almost half a century later, Simon
surveyed a different view. To the east, the suburbs of Calgary have
swallowed the old air base and now lap at the edges of the Indian
reserve. To the west, with the snow-covered Rockies as a backdrop,
teams of Tsuu T'ina Indians, trained as ordnance-disposal workers,
methodically probed the prairie with metal detectors. A military
ambulance was parked on a hill, its large red cross prominent in
the dun landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little-known footnote to the military history of North
America that when wars loomed in the 20th century, military
planners in Canada and the United States repeatedly turned to the
defeated native peoples of the West and took control, through
leases or outright expropriation, of large swaths of land for
bombing ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, at least 16 tribes have land contaminated
with the litter of bombs, or with a more dangerous kind of
pollution: unexploded bombs lying buried in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes buried ammunition in two native areas in
Alaska, an old gunnery range at the Fort Apache Reservation in
Arizona, a target range on Timbisha Shoshone land in Death Valley,
Calif., a bomb-test range on the Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota,
a weapons-testing range on Paiute land in Nevada, old ranges on the
lands of three New Mexico pueblos, and four bombing ranges in South
Dakota, including the 54-square-mile Badlands Bombing Range on
Lakota Sioux land in Pine Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the pattern was similar, with old bombing ranges on
about half a dozen Indian reserves, ranging from British Columbia
to Ontario. Brian Lloyd, a former British army bomb-disposal expert
who directs cleanup operations here, said: ``In Canada, the
military acted like a giant, using Indian land like steppingstones
across the country. You find an Indian nation, and you find range
contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on that comes easily on this reservation of 1,200
people, linguistic cousins of the Navajos and Apaches of the
American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured, `It's Indian land, and what the heck, if we use
bombs and explosives and the Indians come and blow themselves up,
what's the loss?''' Simon said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   One early spring morning in 1953, when he was 11, Simon was out
on the range, picking up casings to sell to a Calgary scrap-metal
dealer. He recalls retrieving from the brush a shell without a top.
After moving it, he continued, ``I saw heat waves; I thought, `This
thing is going to blow up.'''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to throw it, but the ice-covered casing slipped in his
hands. The ensuing explosion threw him 150 feet. ``My grandmother,
my brother and my auntie were all blown flat,'' he said, all
injured in the blast. Today he carries 11 pieces of shrapnel in his
body.
</P>
<P>
   But now things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, the 90-year military lease on Tsuu T'ina land
expired, ending military control over 12,000 acres _ one-sixth of
the reservation _ that had started in 1910. As other Canadian and
U.S. tribes study cleaning up old bombing ranges on their lands,
this one plans to hold in July what it describes as North America's
first native conference on military cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   For this tribe, which operates a business park and golf courses,
there is profit in explosives disposal. In 1986, after the Canadian
military did a halfhearted cleanup job here, the tribe formed
Wolf's Flat Ordnance Disposal Corp., the only such native-owned and
operated company in North America. On government contracts, this
company, with 136 full- and part-time workers, has also worked
clearing mines in Kosovo, Panama and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The recent protests against the use of part of the island of
Vieques as a live fire-training site for the U.S. Navy have
fostered hopes here for eventual cleanup contracts in Puerto Rico.
Right now, however, Tsuu T'ina leaders complain that the U.S.
ordnance-disposal market is closed to Canadians because of Pentagon
rules requiring technicians certified in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government, which promotes land-mine clearance
worldwide, has paid the tribal company to clean up the range here,
believing that the natives had more incentive to clean up their
land than the soldiers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1981, the military had 1,000 soldiers in here for 16 days _
they certified the land free and clear of explosives, and then
dumped it back on the nation,'' Lloyd said. ``Since the military
declared the land cleared, we have pulled out 1 million items of
ordnance, expended rounds, live rounds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the oldest pieces dating to 1896, the range here was
littered with weaponry from Canada's participation in the Boer War,
World War I, World War II and the Korean War. There were
high-explosive mortar shells, 60-pound shrapnel-filled howitzer
rounds, .50-caliber machine-gun bullets, air-to-ground rockets,
land mines, flares, riot-control projectiles and even two rusting
rifles, apparently lost by absent-minded soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule was `If you sign it out, don't bring it back,''' said
Roy Whitney, the tribal chief. ``We found boxes of grenades from
the Second World War that were just buried in the ground because
they didn't want to take them back.''
</P>
<P>
   For cleanup crews, one of the biggest dangers has been buried
phosphorus shells. On contact with air, they can resume burning
after a 50-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   With about 90 percent of the 12,000 acres cleaned up, entirely
without accident, tribal leaders now are debating development plans
for Indian land along the edge of the reserve already disturbed by
military construction: 45 holes of golf, shopping centers, a
casino, residential developments on 75-year leases, even a freeway
with electronic toll collection, to link the sprawling southern and
western suburbs of Calgary, a city expected to hit 1 million in
population by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   On the spiritual side, tribal elders are planning to hold a
land-renewal ceremony this summer. Joe Big Plume, an 82-year-old
retired professional pool player, said he plans a cleansing
ceremony that would include traditional prayers, feasting and
dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we did the army a favor, leasing our land to them,
letting them train on it,'' Big Plume said. ``We did not know they
would abuse the land. You still can't just go and plow anyplace _
you are going to hit a live bomb.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Clearly, the history lay in action, not words:
Before a mob of photographers, President Ernesto Zedillo placed the
first telephone call on a new fixed-wireless network being
installed in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``De aqui pa'ya,'' he said in slangy Spanish that literally
means ``From here to there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as resonant, perhaps, as ``Mr. Watson, come here. I want to
see you.'' But the May 11 call made history nonetheless because it
marked another of Latin America's leap-frogging jumps into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   And it represented yet another landmark in the effort by the
system's creator, Nortel Networks of Canada, to become the
next-generation Internet builder for the Americas. Perhaps more
than any other technology player, Nortel _ already a
telecommunications power in North America _ is capitalizing on the
changes sweeping Latin America as the company tries to make the
entire hemisphere its home market.
</P>
<P>
   The fixed-wireless phone that Zedillo used works like any
telephone except that it was not connected by wire to the lines and
poles run by Mexico's dominant telephone company, Telmex. Instead,
the handset operates by radio wave, like a cellular phone, but one
for use only in a fixed location. An outside antenna is all that
needs to be installed _ a huge advantage in a country where it can
take years to get a regular phone and where many rural areas have
never been wired.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's participation in the first call underscores the
Mexican government's pride in the new system and in Axtel, the
Mexican-controlled company that runs it. But development and
construction of the system was the work of Nortel, a foreign
company.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has come to Latin America's telecommunications, and
Nortel has come with it. The company is building an essentially
identical fixed wireless system in Mexico City for Axtel's main
competitor, UNEFON, and is busy installing advanced communications
systems throughout South America, Central America and the
Caribbean, with the exception of Cuba. Meanwhile, the company
operates a wireless systems research center in Campinas, Brazil,
and produces wireless communications equipment in an adjoining
plant. Last week, Nortel announced a contract with GVT of Brazil, a
local and long-distance telephone company, to install an advanced
telecommunications system _ including the backbone of an optical
network _ for the capital city of Brasilia and nine surrounding
states.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Nortel employed 2,000 workers in northern Mexico
to produce telephone equipment. In a further attempt to focus on
advanced systems, the company decided to sell the manufacturing
operation to Solectron, the world's largest contract maker of
electronics, for $900 million. But the two companies then promptly
signed a four-year supply agreement worth more than $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel is also expanding in Asia and Europe: On Monday it is
scheduled to announce a number of alliances with European companies
that will collaborate with Nortel on the development of a new
generation of Internet technology for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nortel is growing so rapidly outside Canada that doubts
are being expressed there about its corporate citizenship, and a
Canadian magazine recently asked, only half joking, whether the
company had surrendered its Canadian passport. Its headquarters
remains in Brampton, Ontario, but more of its 75,000 employees live
and work south of the Canada-U.S. border than north of it. Fewer
than 10 percent of Nortel's executives still work in Canada, and
just 8 percent of its $21 billion in revenues comes from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roots are definitely Canadian, but we're a global
corporation,'' said Martha Helena Bejar, general manager of Nortel
Networks Latin America. She spoke during an interview at Nortel's
Mexican headquarters on the 30th floor of a downtown Mexico City
building that bears the company's name. ``We're not focused on a
specific market; we're focused on a segment, which is the
telecommunications industry, including optical, Internet and
wireless services.''
</P>
<P>
   Nortel is not the only corporation to cast its shadow across the
hemisphere, of course. The American automobile companies have been
doing it for decades, and both Nortel's fiercest competitors,
Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems, are trying to make inroads
into Latin America. But Nortel is notable for the way it has
expanded by exploiting the radical changes in the region's economic
profile. As country after country has opened its market _
privatizing state-run enterprises, encouraging competition and
liberalizing regulations to let technological change flourish _
Nortel has seized opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And as the company rides the wave of change in Latin America's
economies, it has been transforming itself from an old-line
manufacturer _ mostly of telephone network switching equipment _ to
one of the world's leading Internet and wireless communications
equipment providers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company had its start in 1895 as Northern Electric and
Manufacturing and did not become a major player in the United
States until the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T's Bell System prompted many
of the biggest American telephone companies to seek an alternative
supplier to AT&AMP;T for network equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, by 1997 Nortel had grown to become second only to Lucent
Technologies, the AT&AMP;T spinoff, as the largest manufacturer of
standard telecommunications gear in the world. The company is
active in Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   That year, though, John Roth, Nortel's newly appointed chief
executive, decided that the company had to make a ``right angle
turn'' away from its customary business and into wireless
communications, the Internet and what at the time was considered a
daring combination of them both.
</P>
<P>
   Its strategy since then has been to acquire what it needs to get
a toehold in the new market, then spend billions on research in an
effort to outrun rivals like Cisco Systems and Lucent in the race
toward a better Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel has gone on a shopping spree and picked up many
companies. But the biggest and most important so far has been Bay
Networks, a data networking leader based in Santa Clara, Calif. The
purchase in 1998 was for $9.1 billion in stock, roughly one quarter
of Nortel's market capitalization at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The task of melding Bay's Silicon Valley mentality with the
century-old telecommunications manufacturer made some analysts
uneasy. And investors sneered at first.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay acquisition is now widely regarded as the key to
Nortel's successful transformation, a makeover that has turned it
into the biggest Canadian company by market capitalization, and a
global force to be reckoned with in advanced telecommunications and
the Internet. Nortel has tried to position itself as the inventor
of a bigger and faster Internet, a strategy featured in the
company's television commercials, which put Nortel in the position
of asking people all over the world, ``What do you want the
Internet to be?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bay takeover, Nortel has made $12 billion of
additional acquisitions, many of them companies in the United
States that Nortel paid for with its own rapidly appreciating
stock. Nortel shares reached an all-time high of $72 in March, and
even after the stock market's downdraft it remains one of the
better performing telecommunications stocks, traded in both New
York and Canada. Its market value makes it the biggest blue-chip
stock in Canada, accounting for more than 30 percent of the market
value of the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies we bought are incubators, and they've each got a
great idea,'' said Bejar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Colombia.
``Nortel Networks comes in and gives closure to those great
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovations like the photonic switching technology developed for
fiber optic networks by Xros Inc., the California company acquired
for $3.25 billion in Nortel stock earlier this year, have broadened
Nortel's technical arsenal. The company hires a quarter of all
electrical engineering and computer science graduates in Canada and
spends more on research _ $3 billion a year _ than the government
of Canada or any Canadian company.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Nortel's growing technological prowess has
helped the company expand across the hemisphere. Nortel first sold
standard switching equipment in Latin America in the 1960s, but on
a limited scale because it was competing with entrenched
multinationals like Ericsson of Sweden and Alcatel of France that
dominated traditional services in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid development of wireless and optical networks gave
Nortel the chance to break in because that required all new
technology, not just an extension of existing service. Nortel has
risen to No. 2, behind Ericsson in the region's wireless market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get in with our wireless products in Brazil,
Chile, Colombia and Central America, and capitalize on the
liberalization of the markets,'' Bejar said. In some cases, as
local regulations eased, Nortel's customers converted existing
cellular phone licenses to fixed-wireless and to wireless Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet use in Latin America is comparatively,
advertisers, merchandisers and the telecommunications companies see
great growth potential in the region. According to surveys, only
about 1.5 percent of the region's 500 million people now use the
Internet, compared with more than 24 percent in the United States.
But Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. expects Internet access in the region to
double the next three years, while rapidly developing economies
like those of Brazil and Mexico could expand at a far quicker pace.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the wireless market has demonstrated the region's
growth potential. In 1995, there were 4 million wireless
subscribers in Latin America; By the end of last year, that number
had risen to 30 million, roughly the population of Canada. By 2003,
the wireless market in Latin America is expected to be 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Countries like Mexico enjoy something of an advantage when it
comes to such advanced technology. Existing systems are so
primitive that little is worth saving. Everything old can be
replaced with the newest generation of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of customers who take pride in leap-frogging
over existing technologies and bragging, `I have the same
technology that MCI WorldCom has,''' Bejar said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge O. Mariscal, managing director of Latin America Equity
Research for Goldman, Sachs said: ``What we've got now is an almost
seamless Americas market. The combination of regulatory changes and
market liberalization have worked toward creating a strong
operating environment for not just international companies like
Nortel, but local companies, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the example of Telmex, which after losing its monopoly
on long-distance and local telephone service in Mexico, has been
busy expanding into the United States and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   In the end perhaps, the most obvious motivation for Nortel's
transformation and push to expand is the limitation of its home
base. Canada, the company's home for over a century, is already a
well wired and mature market, whereas Latin America remains young
and full of potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you plot out the growth of wireless in Latin America, it
really looks like a hockey stick, fairly level and then zooming
right up,'' Bejar said.
</P>
<P>
   A hockey stick seems a strange metaphor for a native of Colombia
to use to describe a telecommunications market. But like Nortel
itself, there's no question of where it had come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's Canadian, eh?'' she said.

GORE'S PLAN WILL OFFER VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS TO SOME
TAXPAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky.) By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Details began emerging Sunday of Vice President Al
Gore's proposal for a $200 billion program to help low- and
middle-income taxpayers build retirement accounts separate from
what they will receive from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's program would work the way 401(k) savings plans work, but
instead of employer contributions, the federal government would
make contributions in the form of tax credits, providing in some
cases up to a 3-to-1 match.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``retirement savings plus,'' the plan would offer tax
relief for couples with combined annual incomes of up to $100,000,
or individuals making up to $50,000. Gore's program would provide
the greatest benefit for couples with incomes of less than $30,000.
The program would cost the government $200 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary program, designed to compete with Gov. George W.
Bush's proposal for individuals to invest an unspecified portion of
their Social Security payroll tax in the stock market, would create
a fund for each participant that could expand by a maximum of
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple making up to $30,000 a year could contribute up
to $500 annually. They would then receive a refundable tax credit
of $1,500, bringing their account to $2,000. A couple making
$100,000 could contribute $1,500 to their account and earn a tax
credit of $500.
</P>
<P>
   Like IRAs and 401(k) plans, contributions to the accounts would
be tax deducible, accounts would grow tax-free and withdrawals
would be taxed. Private financial institutions would manage the
accounts. According to Gore aides, participation in the program
over 35 years of work would yield an individual about $200,000 for
retirement over and above Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does two things that Gore had earlier criticized in
the plan offered by his Republican rival. One, it allows people to
invest taxpayer money in the stock market. Two, it substantially
increases the amount of the federal budget surplus that Gore would
devote to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been fiercely critical of Bush for
devoting a trillion dollars of the surplus to an across-the-board
income tax cut over 10 years. But now, with this new savings plan,
Gore's total of targeted tax cuts clocks in at $500 billion over 10
years, twice what he had proposed before, and half of Bush's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, in interviews Sunday, said that the Gore plan is
a hedge against what they see as the risky alternative that Bush is
proposing. They said financial institutions would be limited to
offering investment options based on broad-based mutual funds for
equities, bonds and government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore intends to lay out the plan in a speech on Tuesday in
Lexington, Ky. The speech comes at the beginning of the second week
of his three-week ``progress and prosperity tour'' (sometimes
called the ``prosperity and progress tour'' by Gore) in which he is
traveling to key battleground states to try to get credit for the
nation's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement plan is a vivid example of how Gore is trying to
take advantage of the burgeoning federal budget surplus by spending
it on targeted groups of voters whom he needs to win over in
November _ in this case, low-income and middle-income working
families, the core Democratic base that polls have indicated are
slipping from Gore's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Gore's proposal revealed a weakening of his
stance against putting taxpayer money in the financial markets and
would thus contribute to an overall impression of Gore as someone
without reliable core values.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week the vice president will flip flop flip by coming out
for the use of tax money to be invested in the market to help
people retire,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's campaign spokesman.
``It's his third position in six months on the soundness of using
tax money to invest in markets to secure people's retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer pointed to the Clinton administration's now abandoned
position laid out in this year's budget proposal to allow
government-controlled investments in the markets, and then to a
Gore speech in May when he criticized Bush's plan to allow people
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing this to blunt Governor Bush's approach to allow
people to invest in the markets to help them retire with more
money,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer was talking about Gore's retirement plan, but he was
not the only one suggesting Sunday that Gore was perhaps going
through multiple reinventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new campaign chairman, William Daley, the commerce
secretary, made the rounds of the television talk shows Sunday and
was asked repeatedly about the vice president's continually
evolving personas.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Russert posed the question on the NBC program ``Meet The
Press'': ``Fairly or unfairly, there's a perception that Al Gore
has changed positions on abortion, on gun control, Elian Gonzalez,
wearing earth tones, wearing sports shirts, wearing coats and ties,
changing campaign chairmen, moving from Washington to Nashville,
suddenly in favor of a $500 billion tax cut _ that Gore has no
center, that he flips and panders as a politician. Is that a
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Daley replied, ``There's a problem because those are all
misconceptions that have been developed by either the opposition or
by media who aren't really following this day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The fact of the matter is, Al Gore has been
consistent about working for the average man and woman out there
and trying to address their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor has been tepid lately toward Gore, both for
his support for a bill to make normal trade relations permanent
with China and for naming Daley as his chairman to replace the
ailing Tony Coelho. Daley led the administration's fight on Capitol
Hill to pass the trade bill, which labor vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Sunday that he had talked with several labor leaders
over the last few days, including John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO, who met with Gore on Friday to complain about the Daley
appointment. Daley suggested his talks with labor leaders had been
fruitful and said he expected to meet with Sweeney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other Gore aides spent the day briefing reporters on the
retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   They said that while the chief goal of the plan would be to
provide a cushion for retirement nest eggs, participants could
withdraw their savings at any time without penalty for three
specific purposes: to cover catastrophic health expenses, to help
buy a first home, or to pay for a child's college education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan would encourage the rate of personal
savings, which has plunged to more than half the previous total
over the last decade. And they said that at a rate of return of 5.3
percent, an account for an individual could grow to $202,000 over
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that the program would be simplified by
having the Internal Revenue Service create a mechanism to deposit
people's tax credit and a share of their tax refunds directly into
the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' according to briefing paper prepared by the Gore
campaign, ``with a simple check-off on your tax return, workers
could see up to $2,000 each deposited in the `retirement savings
plus' each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan is based on the universal savings accounts
proposed in the 1999 State of the Union address by President
Clinton, a complex proposal that never made it through Congress.

BITTER OSCAR PLAYS VICTIM CARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya the coddled has become Oscar De
La Hoya the victim, at least in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The now-former WBC welterweight champion had been beaten fairly
and squarely by Shane Mosley on Saturday at Staples Center but
lashed out afterward as if the boxing world that has warmly
embraced him his entire career has suddenly turned against him.
</P>
<P>
   He stunned those at a post-fight news conference by implying he
was the victim of a calculated decision to give Mosley this fight
so others involved in the promotion could cash in on a rematch and
possibly a third fight.
</P>
<P>
   And, he would point out, this comes after he was cheated in his
loss to Felix Trinidad in September.
</P>
<P>
   He's so frustrated, so bitter, he said he'd consider retirement
rather than subject himself again to the evils of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to rethink my whole game plan in life,'' he said. ``I
know the (boxing) business. People want a rematch (with Mosley). I
have to think about my health and career and my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I trained very hard. When I see things like this happen,
it turns me off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give me the decision, there's no (second or) third
fight. Now, there has to be a rematch. ... It's tough to live with
what goes on around boxing. Maybe tomorrow I'll feel different.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the point, however misguided it is.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, De La Hoya, who believes he won a close fight, didn't
have a grasp on reality when he made these statements.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that the majority of people at ringside saw the fight
along the lines of Lou Filippo (116-112) and Pat Russell (115-113),
the judges who gave Mosley the victory. The Daily News and
Associated Press both scored it 116-112 Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that this fight was in no way a repeat of De La Hoya-
Trinidad in Las Vegas, in which almost everyone who saw the fight
believes De La Hoya did enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that De La Hoya could've kept his belt had he won the
terrific 12th round. Had Russell scored the round for De La Hoya,
his final tally would've been 114-114 and the result would've been
a draw.
</P>
<P>
   However, (begin ital)no one(end ital) would've scored the final
three minutes in De La Hoya's favor, not even Marty Sammon, who had
the former champ winning 115-113 but gave Mosley the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, fresher and stronger in the end, landed twice as many
punches as De La Hoya in one of the more memorable - but clearly
one-sided - rounds in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that the officials associated with the fighters and
the bout had no compelling reason to cheat De La Hoya. Had he won,
he would have continued to generate a tremendous amount of money
for all involved no matter who his next opponent might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Money follows the guy wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   And, from a long-term perspective, boxing seems to thrive only
when it has a superstar leading the way, a superstar like De La
Hoya. To tear him down is to tear down the sport.
</P>
<P>
   None of it makes sense, even in a sport capable of anything.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned here for De La Hoya isn't that people
are out to get him. It's that sometimes life isn't fair (the
Trinidad fight) and that no one wins every time out (the Mosley
fight) - not even the Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, (begin ital)he(end ital) was the benefactor of
controversial decisions earlier in his career. Many believe to this
day that he was beaten by both Pernell Whitaker and Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Now - against both Trinidad and Mosley - is simply his turn to
be on the unfortunate side of tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A true champion doesn't whine about how the world is out to get
him. He accepts life's setbacks, learns from them and hopefully
emerges a better person - and better fighter - as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensible thing De La Hoya said all night is that maybe
he'll feel differently tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   He probably will. He won't retire. Too young (27), too much
money to be made, too much pride.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get his rematch with Mosley perhaps early next year and a
chance to regain his championship and some of the respect he's lost
as a result of the two losses.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, let's hope he's more gracious afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet as Sugar: The fight wasn't over for more than a few hours
and already knowledgeable boxing observers began to assess Mosley's
place among the best fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put him right there with Roy Jones Jr.,'' one said.
``(begin ital)Higher(end ital),'' another said. ``It's Jones,
Mosley, Trinidad,'' injected a third.
</P>
<P>
   That's how high they are on Mosley at the moment. And for good
reason: He was nothing short of brilliant Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He had never been in such a big fight in his life - with 20,744
mostly De La Hoya fans yelling and screaming at Staples Center -
yet he looked as relaxed and comfortable as he is sparring in the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   His poise, apparently the product of his easy-going nature and
supreme confidence in his ability, was striking.
</P>
<P>
   He stood face-to-face with the boxer many believed was the best
in the world and never doubted for a second that he was better.
</P>
<P>
   He had never faced a fighter of De La Hoya's physical strength.
This was only his third fight at 147 pounds after moving up from
135 and (begin ital)he(end ital) appeared to be the stronger of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   It was (begin ital)his(end ital) punches, not De La Hoya's, that
did the most damage.
</P>
<P>
   And those skills were something to behold. Everyone knew he was
one of the most complete fighters in the world. He just never had
the chance to prove it against an opponent of this caliber.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, did he prove it. He is simply better - considerably
better, in some eyes - than De La Hoya. That's the only logical
conclusion after watching Saturday's fight: He had to win the final
six rounds to win the fight and did just that.
</P>
<P>
   He won rounds six through 12 on Pat Russell's card, five of six
according to Lou Filippo and somehow split the rounds on the card
of Marty Sammon.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Mosley will live up to the name
Sugar, the moniker of two of the greatest fighters ever: Sugar Ray
Robinson and Sugar Ray Leonard. At 28, he's only now hitting his
peak.
</P>
<P>
   However, we saw something special Saturday, and he should only
get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you what I was going to do,'' Mosley said, ``and I did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He sure did.
</P>
<P>
   CompuBox: Computer statistics were very tight.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley landed 284 of 678 punches, De La Hoya 257 of 718. Mosley
connected on 174 of 304 power punches, De La Hoya 165 of 448. And
Mosley landed 110 of 374 jabs, De La Hoya 92 of 270.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking number is Mosley's connection rate on power
punches: 57 percent (to De La Hoya's 37 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the statistics don't tell us much.
</P>
<P>
   Second chance: HBO will replay the fight at 10:45 p.m. next
Saturday.

 &HT;    Measuring the shape we're in
 &HT;    By John McCosh
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Earl Babbitt is tired of bumping his knees on the
backs of airplane seats and squeezing his 6-foot-3-inch frame into
cars made for smaller people.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he did something about it. Babbitt joined hundreds of
people participating in a body measurement study at Georgia Tech
this month. Tech is the final stop on a 12-city U.S. tour that has
drawn thousands of people providing personal statistics that
companies can use to make clothes fit better and cars more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a tall guy, and I want to put in a vote in for my folks,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   To cast his ballot, the Georgia Tech graduate student adviser
changed into a pair of bike shorts and subjected himself to 40 of
what people in the body sizing business call ``traditional
measurements,'' which are done with calipers and measuring sticks.
Next came the high-tech sizing, a three-dimensional laser scan that
adds Babbitt's image and vital statistics to a database that is
nearing 4,000 people. After 17-second laser scan, Babbitt walked
over to a computer screen to see his image painted in a variety of
angles.
</P>
<P>
   The study is sponsored by the U.S. Air Force and dozens of
private companies concerned that, for most of us, things just don't
fit right. The military last did a body measurement study in the
1950s and then the subjects were mostly physically fit young men.
This $6 million study is by far the most diverse that's been
conducted. Atlanta was chosen as a measuring site specifically to
increase the number of African-Americans in the database.
</P>
<P>
   One early conclusion from the study: Most of us have a
body-image problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've had one woman look at the computer screen
without saying, 'Ugh! I look fat,''' said Beth McCrary, the study's
project director at Georgia Tech. ``We're not happy with
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have athletically trained for weeks before their
measuring appointment. Many suck in their guts as the machine that
lowers the laser scanner begins to hum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both the fit and flabby come to be measured. Since the
project began two years ago, measurement volunteers have weighed in
at 80 pounds on the low end and 400 pounds at the upper end of the
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wonder why would a 340-pound person want to
come in here and put on shorts and a sports bra,'' said Scott
Fleming, a consultant with Sytronics, the contractor conducting the
study for the Air Force. ``It's because nothing has fit their whole
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he's among those who have trouble fitting into the
off-the-rack world created by clothes designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think most people my weight are much shorter than me,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's dissatisfaction with what the garment industry
provides places him with the majority of American consumers. A 1999
survey by retail consultant Kurt Salmon Associates found that 62
percent of clothes shoppers complain that they can't find anything
that fits well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the American body has changed,'' and
clothes designer haven't kept up,'' said Adelle Kirk, a principal
with Kurt Salmon. ``And, frankly, the consumer has gotten more
demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Body scanning is one way to answer the growing demands for a
custom fit. The same Kurt Salmon study found 59 percent of people
surveyed would disrobe for the scanners if it meant better-fitting
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is already offering body scanning for custom
fit clothes at some of its stores. The San Francisco-based blue
jeans maker calls its body scanning program ``Original Spin''. Levi
Strauss is also participating in the Air Force study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to help us in the earliest stages of designing to
better fit the range in body sizes,'' said Jeff Beckman, a
spokesman for Levi Strauss. ``This is the first research of its
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies contributing $40,000 to help fund the study, and
get first crack the data, include airplane manufacturers, car
makers and swimwear makers. The Society of Automotive Engineers is
a lead sponsor of the project and will later sell the data for
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the study began with a military focus. The Air
Force planned to study people in the U.S. and in NATO countries to
figure out how to make equipment such as oxygen masks and flight
suits fit an increasingly diverse group of recruits. In 1992 the
Air Force noticed that clothing and car makers were about to
conduct their own similar studies and pitched a collaborative
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed CAESAR (Civilian American and European Surface
Anthropometry Resource), the researchers took their laser machine
on the road in April 1998. After visiting 10 major cities across
the U.S., the project made stops in San Francisco and Atlanta in an
effort to add more diversity to the sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at an African-American woman and Asian woman of
the same height and weight and looked at the shape differences,''
said Kathleen Robinette, director of the CAESAR project. ``It
really impresses how important it is to get people of all racial
groups. The big difference with this study is you get the shape in
3-D, and you can immediately see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the differences, she said, is Asians tend to have shorter
legs for their height than the rest of the population, and
African-Americans tend to have longer legs.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the car companies are likely to customize
interiors for different races.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be able to fit a whole spectrum of people,''
Robinette said. ``What I've heard is they want to have a
one-size-fits-all car. They use it for laying out the interior,
crash testing and packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   The clothing companies are interested in using the data to offer
custom-fit garments. Kirk, of Kurt Salmon, said the customized
market is now probably less than 1 percent of total apparel sales.
But she expects that to grow to as much as 20 percent in the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Robinette said consumers won't have to wait that long before
they see results from the survey. Data collected at the first three
cities has been tabulated and forwarded to the companies that paid
the sponsor fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the benefits as early as next year,'' Robinette
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at Georgia Tech will continue measuring people
through the end of June and are still making appointments. They've
measured about 120 people and hope another 130 come in before they
leave town.
</P>
<P>
   The process takes about an hour, starting with filling out forms
and changing into shorts, because the laser doesn't scan through
clothes. Fleming said he learned through trial and error to tell
people they would have to wear the skin-tight clothes. Some people
walked out the door when they saw the bike shorts they were asked
to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the measuring sticks and calipers. Researchers put
the volunteers on a scale and measure the body 40 different ways,
sitting and standing.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers prepare the volunteer for the scanner. They
place 72 adhesive white dots from head to toe, reference points
that show exactly how far one point on the scanned image is from
another. A nylon skull cap is added to cover up the hair.
</P>
<P>
   Then the volunteer stands on a platform centered among four
posts mounted with laser cameras that move up and down for
scanning. The laser is about as powerful as the one at grocery
store checkouts.
</P>
<P>
   And then comes the only painful part of the process. Those
little adhesive dots tend to cling to hair.

INTERNET MERCHANTS ENTICE SHOPPERS WITH SWEEPSTAKES 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advertisements touting cash giveaways and other sweepstakes have
cluttered the Internet for years, mostly appearing on search
services and other high-traffic informational Web sites. For
marketers, the object of the game was, and is, to compel
million-dollar dreamers to fork over their e-mail addresses and
other valuable personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, sweepstakes are migrating with increasing frequency
from informational sites to the front pages of Internet merchants.
Last week, for instance, buyers could register to win a trip to
Universal Studios from CDNow, a BMW from Buy.com, and a trip to see
a Dave Matthews Band concert from Borders.com, among many other
come-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the goals are similar to those of advertisers _ namely,
get the consumers' e-mail addresses, and their consent to send
follow-up missives about new products and sales. But for e-commerce
executives, sweepstakes offer other, more immediate benefits,
including the chance to attract new customers and keep existing
customers coming back to the site. And because investors have
diminishing patience for Internet merchants that use generous, if
not ludicrously expensive, product giveaways and free shipping
promotions to snare new customers, e-tailers see sweepstakes as a
much more affordable way to achieve marketing goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As e-commerce companies look more closely at their marketing
budget, they're shifting more and more of that money into
promotions, and sweepstakes in particular,'' said Steven Krein,
chief executive of Promotions.com, which conducts promotions on
behalf of Internet companies. ``It's much more attractive than
giving price-offs, or giving stuff away with every purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no shortage of original ideas on the Web, one
of the more imaginative sweepstakes offers from e-commerce sites
lately is the ``Win-a-Guy'' sweepstakes from OurHouse.com, which
sells home improvement supplies. In the contest, those who buy
something on the site earn chances to win a week's worth of
services from Lou Manfredini, who goes by the name Mr. Fix-It on a
Chicago radio program and on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea had to do with the tone of sweepstakes in general,
which is that they're fun,'' said Gary Briggs, OurHouse.com's chief
marketing officer. ``We wanted to do more than just say, `Come to
the site, get a free coffee maker.'''
</P>
<P>
   The current Win-a-Guy sweepstakes is OurHouse.com's second such
effort. The first, which ran from February through April, generated
more than 100,000 registrants _ of which 85,000 agreed to accept
marketing messages by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   As with other e-commerce executives who use sweepstakes, Briggs
has changed the campaign to fit his marketing goals of the moment.
When the site rolled out in November, he said, the first contest
was intended to acquire new customers, with a $10 discount for
first-time buyers who registered for the sweepstakes. By contrast,
Briggs said the current contest ``is more about driving people for
repeat visits and purchases.'' And so it rewards repeat buyers with
more chances to win.
</P>
<P>
   The best testament to the success of this promotion, of course,
is the revenue ultimately generated from contest registrants. Those
who entered the first Win-a-Guy sweepstakes bought $30 more in
goods per order than those who did not, Briggs said. And under the
current campaign, repeat customers in the sweepstakes have bought
$20 more in goods per order than other repeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   Such fine-tuning and statistical tracking is not found in most
sweepstakes, said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research, an
Internet consulting firm. ``We've been shocked at how little
tracking people do for any of their promotions,'' Nail said. ``When
we recently asked about the cost of promotions or what kind of
customers they generated from them, about 60 percent didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hamlin, vice president for operations at iQVC, the
Internet division of the shop-by-television company QVC, said that
when the site ran its only sweepstakes two years ago, iQVC did not
track the success of the program, aside from logging the names and
e-mail addresses of the 19,000 registrants.
</P>
<P>
   That will change, he said, with a new sweepstakes later this
year. That sweepstakes will dovetail with an ongoing contest on the
QVC network, in which announcers disclose a ``lucky number'' eight
times a day. QVC customers whose membership numbers match the lucky
number receive a $10 account credit, and are eligible to win cash
and prizes. Hamlin said the Web site would join the contest,
disclosing lucky numbers periodically and announcing winners.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating the two programs, he said, will enable the company
to lure more television customers to the Internet. ``When we bring
customers to the Web, their yearly purchases increase 25 percent,''
Hamlin said. ``So obviously, the more we can bring over, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequent refrain of sweepstakes naysayers is that the types of
people who seek quick riches or product giveaways are the least
desirable customers a company could engage. But Jonas Steinman,
co-founder of iWon.com, which is backed by CBS, said such opinions
were baseless. IWon, a so-called portal site, has given away more
than $21 million in sweepstakes cash to registered users since it
started in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-three million out of 190 million adults participated in
a sweepstakes or another game of chance in the U.S. last year,''
Steinman said. ``Contrary to the myth that participants are somehow
lower-end, they're increasingly reflective of the demographics of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the buying behavior of sweepstakes participants on the
site's shopping channel, Bill Daugherty, iWon's other co-founder,
would not disclose specifics, but said the site's merchant partners
were ``incredibly pleased with the conversion rates of our users.''
</P>
<P>
   CDNow, which sells music CDs online, has also found that
sweepstakes provide fertile ground for customers. According to
Samantha Liss, the company's senior director for brand marketing,
between 8 percent and 12 percent of those who sign up for
sweepstakes and agree to be sent follow-up e-mail messages
eventually become paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow started using sweepstakes on the site at the end of 1997,
Liss said, and now runs one a quarter. The company initially paid
outside experts to manage the campaigns, she said, but now conducts
all such efforts with its own staff members. ``We've got it down to
a turnkey operation now,'' she said. ``We've got almost a template
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   CDNow's promotions manager handles the sweepstakes, she said,
and four other employees devote ``a couple days, tops, per
quarter'' to the events.
</P>
<P>
   Liss said CDNow had been able to extract sponsorship fees from
companies interested in using the sweepstakes as marketing
opportunities. At the end of last year, for example, CDNow ran a
millennium promotion, in which it gave away an Oldsmobile Alero.
Oldsmobile provided CDNow a car to give away, bought advertising
for the event and paid an undisclosed amount to CDNow for
sponsorship rights.
</P>
<P>
   Given such an arrangement, Liss said, the company's sweepstakes
have become a revenue source in their own right _ an invaluable
asset for a business that, like many other e-tailers, is
struggling. Liss declined to say how much revenue the site had
generated from its sweepstakes operations. ``I'll just say it's
been a very nice vehicle for us,'' she said.

already facing hurdles in its efforts to prosecute a scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, but last week's disclosures that two hard drives filled
with highly sensitive weapons data had inexplicably vanished have
potentially made it far more difficult for prosecutors in what had
once been described as a major national security case. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has insisted from the time he was indicted
last year that security breaches at the laboratory are common, and
that the kind of downloading he did -- moving classified data, in
the open, from a secure to unsecured computer, then downloading it
to tapes -- was done frequently by other experts protecting data

   BUSH-BIO-III (New Haven, Conn.) _ Born at the earliest fringe of

sides in the great battles then unfolding over politics, civil
rights, drugs and music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those
upheavals, but when forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the
values and ideals established by his parents' generation. Unlike
others of his generation, like Clinton or Gore, Bush never wore his
hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with existentialism or
cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his parents (instead of
hard rock music, he listened to soul). Even today, Bush thunders in
his stump speeches against boomer-style self-indulgence and appeals
for a ``responsibility era'' that in some respects sounds like the
1950s; he likes values as clean-cut as his hair. 4000 words. By

administration is opening Cuba to American travelers at a rate not
seen in more than 40 years. While administration officials deny
that the increased travel is intended to undermine the 38-year-old
embargo against Cuba, the new flow has given rise to a flurry of
business, personal and political contacts and there is a renewed

   VT-HEALTH-BENEFITS (Cowtown, Vt.) _ With health insurance for

on Medicare, Vermont is in the vanguard in terms of providing
medical benefits. The array of health benefits Vermont affords its
citizens _ not just the elderly but also children and low-income
adults _ is unmatched by any other state. And while many of
Vermont's programs would not work in larger, more urban, more
racially and ethnically diverse states, other aspects could serve
as a pattern elsewhere. Today, 93.5 percent of all Vermonters have
health insurance, including essentially all children. By contrast,
only 63 percent of low-income children in Texas and 60 percent in
Arizona are insured. What it all means, based on interviews with

   LOS ANGELES _ We were all supposta take off work today and have
a parade downtown to celebrate the Lakers' latest championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then a beautiful thing happened in Indiana-the Pacers' 33-point
win in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   After a momentary shock, everyone put down their cell phone
around here and quickly figured it out-now they can win the whole
sha(begin ital)bang(end ital) in front of their homies.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where ``The Big Matinee Idol'' comes in-center stage at
Staples Center, to claim his prize.
</P>
<P>
   The star attraction on a team that has more movie credits per
player than championship rings has one more wrap party to
attend-bringing Hollywood's elite together one last time to see who
can close the deal on squeezin' another movie out of the league and
playoff MVP while the gettin's good.
</P>
<P>
   He's said he won't do another flick until he wins a title. That
was both a statement and a warning.
</P>
<P>
   So after tonight, accordin' to Shaq's calculations, the only
parade that'll matter is the line of couriers dropping off scripts
with agent Leonard Armato-the slick guy sitting courtside directly
across from the Lakers bench, next to Denzel ...
</P>
<P>
   -It's one thing for Rick L. Williams (Vanessa's the real fox in
that family) to try to get more airtime by pushing Pacers around.
Obviously, that ``Oz'' prison stuff must be going to his pretty
head.
</P>
<P>
   But this post-game ritual he's established with Fred ``Just
Gimme Someone To Talk To'' Roggin is downright bootlickin'. ...
</P>
<P>
   -By the way, the exit is this way, Mr. and Mrs. Rice, and thanks
for playin'. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Wanna see whether Phil Jax is brave enough to ride the parade
through d'town in a convertible with his new babe, Jeanie B., by
his side. And with her dad, Jerry B., on the other side. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Former runaway Laker Cedric Ceballos is listed among the rap
artists performing at UrbanFest L.A. this weekend on the USC
campus. Unless the family decides to take a getaway at Lake Havasu.
...
</P>
<P>
   -They'll be writing poems about Tiger Woods and country songs
about John Daly. ...
</P>
<P>
   -(begin ital)Ahhhhh Sugar(end ital) ... oh, money, money ...
</P>
<P>
   -Any more sponsor ads plastered on Oscar De La Hollywood's
trunks and he could join the Earnhardt family. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Maybe next time Laila Ali can find an 84-year-old
great-grandmother to punch out. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Classic commercial: Don Drysdale interviewing this mop-top
peewee Andre Agassi. Now, if we could just remember the product
being pushed. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Olympic-bound swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg could be more popular
than Lenny Kravitz after the upcoming Aussie Games.
</P>
<P>
   Brandweek magazine reports the Studio City dude already has
``Mary Lou Retton marketing potential,'' having supposedly locked
up $1 mil in endorsements. And Lenny did get a finance degree out
of his USC education. ...
</P>
<P>
   -And this year's Dad's Day stumper: Don't understand why Janice
Holyfield decided to end her four-year marriage with Evander.
Unless it has something to do with the fact that of the champ's
nine kids, two were born to other women since the couple exchanged
vows in '96.

   WASHINGTON _ This reporter begged Sen. Paul Coverdell for
details, just a few colorful anecdotes to illustrate his longtime
relationship with the Bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell _ who is Gov. George W. Bush's point man in the Senate
_ made a vague reference to ``socializing over dinner'' with former
President Bush. ``I'm not a golfer. And I tangled up his fishing
reel, I remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, a few inquiring phone calls later, that Coverdell
had attended Barbara Bush's 75th birthday party at Kennebunkport,
Maine, on June 10, an affair that fell between intimate and gala.
But cocktail chatter is simply not the senator's style. Neither is
name-dropping. And really it was nobody's business but the Bushes'.
</P>
<P>
   Ask just about anyone in the U.S. Senate and they will say this
about Coverdell, the Republican senator from Georgia: If you want
something done, and done well, and you do not want the person
hogging all the glory, call Coverdell. It is one reason he ascended
into the Senate Republican leadership so quickly, as a mere
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Coverdell martini is two olives, hold the gin,'' joked his
former press secretary, Jonathan Baron, who now works for the
decidedly more aggressive Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority
whip.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all of this, Coverdell seems a natural choice for
the potentially treacherous job of liaison between Bush's campaign
and the Senate, famous for its zeppelin-size ego. He took on the
job early last year, after a breakfast meeting with Bush, before
the Bush exploratory committee was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, goes back two decades with the Bush family. He
met Bush's father at a small gathering in Atlanta in the 1970s,
when the elder Bush was ambassador to the United Nations and
Coverdell was a state senator. Coverdell made an impression on
Bush, who invited him to Houston to chat about ideas, and then to
Kennebunkport. A friendship ensued, and Coverdell became a regular
guest at the Kennebunkport compound.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush ran for president in 1980, Coverdell was his finance
chairman in Georgia. He never lost touch with Bush, and was justly
rewarded. In 1988, he became Southern steering committee chairman
for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Bush won the election, Coverdell sent a polite
letter. ``If I can help, I'd like to help,'' the senator said he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Coverdell found himself at the helm of the Peace
Corps, and his rise to the U.S. Senate was set in motion. He was
elected in 1992. Now he hopes to help the Texas governor rocket to
the White House, a job he calls an honor, and the word is he would
be justly rewarded again if Bush were to land the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the governor and the senator diverge; Bush is
reaching out to the political center while Coverdell has grown
increasingly conservative. No matter. His loyalty is what is
important to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's frame is so slight it seems to vanish in his nicely
tailored suits. An insurance man by trade (his family business
prospered with his help), he speaks in quiet, measured cadences,
with the kind of mellow voice that evokes lazy Sunday afternoons on
a porch swing. Today, his socks keep falling down, and he tugs at
them while he talks.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Iowa, lived there for a short time, then wound up
in Georgia, which he embraced as his true home. (He is vague about
why.) After graduating from the University of Missouri with a
journalism degree in 1960, he joined the Army in 1962, was sent to
Okinawa and decided there, at a juncture when many in America were
opting out of the system, that it made more sense to opt in. He
also married Nancy Nally, a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   His role as liaison has morphed into different things at
different moments. ``I'm a facilitator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the job was all about getting Republican senators to
endorse Bush instead of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He did so, lining
up almost every Senate Republican. After McCain beat Bush in the
New Hampshire primary, Coverdell bucked up the governor's
supporters, although he said most senators were not too nervous
about the stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Every other day or so, he touches base with Bush campaign aides
to trade information and alert them to any political land mines.
Early on, it was Karl Rove, Bush's chief campaign strategist. Now
it is Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   They do not usually coordinate ``message,'' mostly because
coordinating anything in the Senate is a challenge. ``It's a
sausage mill here,'' Coverdell said. ``We have a lot of difficulty
clearing the airwaves for a message.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been disagreements, most recently over Kosovo. The
Senate wanted to place a deadline on the troops there. Bush
preferred preserving flexibility on the issue. But that is natural,
Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, Coverdell alerted the Bush people that a number
of Republican senators opposed the nuclear test ban treaty. It was
helpful information, and in the end, Bush opposed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coverdell often deals with requests from senators who want
to talk to Bush about his Social Security plan, for example, or
who, just as important, want to air their views. ``We don't want
black holes,'' he said. ``We want people feeling they are part of
the effort. We want to create good will.''
</P>
<P>
   What about all that distance Bush keeps putting between himself
and Congress? It is all media hype, Coverdell says. ``I think the
relationship with Congress has actually been quite comfortable,''
he said. ``By and large, the goals are very symbiotic.''

ON GREENS, HERE'S SOMETHING TO CHEW ON

<TEXT>
<P>
   So there we were, floating down the Rhine, eating four or five
meals a day prepared by eight French chefs.
</P>
<P>
   We were served goose-liver terrines, rabbit pates, breast of
duckling, sea scallop souffles, filets of beef, wild mushroom
sautes plus crepes, tarts, tortes and Black Forest cake.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? My wife was ecstatic about the lettuce. The leaves
were tiny, delicate and, well, you couldn't get a good grip with
your teeth. It wouldn't have helped if you did, because the lettuce
leaves had as much taste as a cocktail napkin.
</P>
<P>
   It took her three days of research to learn that this green was
called ``mache'' and that you probably couldn't find it in American
markets. That news provided some relief to me.
</P>
<P>
   Romaine lettuce is OK, if it is accompanied in a salad by
shrimp, crab and a Gorgonzola dressing. But when I see somebody
gnawing through a blob of bibb or an undressed slab of iceberg, my
stomach begins to rumble in protest.
</P>
<P>
   If a person has to eat fodder, it should at least taste like
something and provide the consumer with more than a green patch on
a front tooth.
</P>
<P>
   My favorites are beet greens, turnip greens, collards and chard.
They contain far more vitamin C, calcium, iron and beta carotene
than salad greens. They should arrive at the table cooked,
benefiting greatly from their association with bacon grease, onions
and either hot pepper flakes or Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   My wife allows me two tablespoons of bacon grease each
millennium. So I usually substitute low-fat turkey ham for the
bacon, as in the following recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Great Greens
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds greens
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup diced ham (or six slices bacon)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Crushed red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   You can use collards, turnip greens or a combination of the two.
Rinse them, remove tough stems and chop the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   If you use ham, saute it in the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil,
then remove. If you want to include bacon, omit the vegetable oil
and fry until crisp, then remove. Leave 2 tablespoons of grease in
the pot.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining oil or grease, saute the onion until soft but
not browned. Add the chicken broth and half the ham or crumbled
bacon. Bring to a boil, then add the greens in bunches, adding more
as they cook down. Cover the pot and simmer the greens about 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This will serve eight or more with the rest of the bacon and ham
sprinkled across the top. Add red pepper flakes or Tabasco to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   An appropriate main course, to serve with the greens, might be:
</P>
<P>
   Two-Clucker Stew
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 and one-half teaspoons salt (divided)
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 chickens, cut into serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 large onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried sage
</P>
<P>
   6 stalks celery
</P>
<P>
   10 medium carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 pound large, fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   On a piece of waxed paper, mix together the flour, paprika, 1
and one-half teaspoons salt and the pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Wash and dry the chicken then roll to cover in the flour
mixture. Save the remainder of the flour mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and brown the chicken
pieces on both sides, in two batches. Remove to a large pot or
Dutch oven.
</P>
<P>
   Add more olive oil to the pan if needed, and lightly brown the
onions, in two batches. Dump the cooked onions into the pot with
the chicken. Moosh around with a wooden spoon, then add the broth,
basil, sage and the final teaspoon of salt. Bring everything to a
boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each carrot into three or four hunks and add to the stew.
Simmer another 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and quarter the mushrooms. Slice the celery into \-inch
pieces. Add both to the stew along with the lemon juice. Cover and
simmer a final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken pieces and vegetables to a platter in a warm
oven.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, beat together the egg yolks and half-and-half.
Stir in the leftover flour mixture and keep stirring until you have
a smooth paste.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the liquids left in the pot to a boil. Add a cup of these
pot liquids to the egg mixture, stir until smooth then pour the
whole mess into the pot, stirring until the sauce begins to
thicken.
</P>
<P>
   Pour some of the sauce over the chicken and veggies and pass the
remainder around in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Serves eight, over split baking-powder biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   What's that green splotch on your front tooth? If it's mache,
you're outa here!

GLAUS' 20TH HOMER SPARKS ANGELS TO 8-6 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE -- Troy Glaus smacked his 20th home run of the season
to give the Angels a 5-0 lead on their way to an 8-6 win over the
Baltimore Orioles on a hot and humid Sunday afternoon at Camden
Yards, but the 23-year-old third baseman won't let himself get too
excited about the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He's halfway to 40 homers, something no Angel player has ever
done. So what does it mean to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I know I'll end the season with at least 20,'' he
said. ``I don't put too much weight in it. They're nice to hit but
you never know if you'll hit another one.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Glaus' only hit of the day, but the Angels had
everything else working for them as they finished their nine-game
trip with two consecutive wins after losing five of the first
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn had three hits, Darin Erstad hit a two-run homer, and
Orlando Palmeiro, Tim Salmon, Adam Kennedy and Benji Gil all
chipped in with two hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting guys we need to swing the bat to swing the
bat,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Troy hits the homer to
break the game open, Mo gets three hits, Timmy had a big hit.
That's the type of offense we have to have. But we also executed
two hit-and-runs so that helped. Just as important as the big guys
swinging is little ball and that was evident today.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Etherton (2-1) matched his season-high with 6 1/3 innings,
getting the victory while allowing only four hits. He did give up
four runs, but got relief help from Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Troy
Percival (17th save).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, though, as the Angels saw an 8-2 lead shrink to
8-4 going into the ninth. And in the ninth, the Orioles cut their
deficit to 8-6 and brought the winning run to the plate in Delino
DeShields, with Albert Belle looming on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team's been very hot,'' Scioscia said of the Orioles, who
had won six in a row before the Angels took the last two games in
the series. ``They have a lot of veteran hitters, good hitters who
know how to work their way back into a ballgame. You don't expect
it to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped on Orioles starter Scott Erickson (3-4) in the
third inning, which was no small feat. Erickson entered the game
with a 16-4 record vs. the Angels in his career. But in the third,
the Angels got five hits, including an RBI single by Vaughn, a
sacrifice fly by Garret Anderson and Glaus' three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Etherton enough room to work. Making his fifth start
since being called up May 26, Etherton gave up only two hits -- a
two-run homer by Charles Johnson and a double by Will Clark --
through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton has been steady in all five starts. He's pitched at
least five innings in each one, and hasn't allowed more than four
runs in any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any change in his poise, it's the same poise he
had when he first came up,'' Scioscia said. ``It's why he got an
opportunity without a lot of minor league experience. He doesn't
scare off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even with Belle at the plate. Belle who went into the game
with six homers and 16 RBIs in his previous four games. He homered
in all four, but Sunday Etherton got Belle all three times he faced
him. Hasegawa struck out Belle in his fourth at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made good pitches on him,'' Etherton said. ``I know how
dangerous he is. I just moved the ball in and out and fortunately
he it at people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth did a good job of changing speeds on him,'' Scioscia
said. ``He moved the ball around and changed speeds well. He was
pitch-efficient early in the game but the humidity took a lot out
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Etherton was lifted after Harold Baines' RBI single with one out
in the seventh. The Orioles scored another in the inning on Brady
Anderson's RBI single, the run charged to Etherton.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa got the Angels to the ninth, but after giving up a
leadoff homer to Jeff Conine and walking Will Clark, Scioscia went
to Percival, who gave up a single and a walk but ended it by
getting DeShields on a grounder to second.

U.S. AND ALLIES EXPLORE WAYS TO EASE MILOSEVIC OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The Clinton administration is exploring
with some of its NATO allies and Russia the possibility that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia be allowed to leave
office with guarantees for his safety and his savings, senior U.S.
and NATO officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions are delicate and informal, the officials stress,
emphasizing that the administration is not preparing any offer to
Milosevic _ who has been indicted by an international war crimes
tribunal _ and will not make one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``if we were presented with a hard and fast
offer that would get Milosevic out of power, we'd have to think
very hard before saying no,'' a senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior official said that the United States would
condemn any proposal that would allow Milosevic to go anywhere but
to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. ``That's the
policy,'' the official said. ``But `Would we act to stop it or
quietly acquiesce?' is another question,'' the official said,
adding carefully, ``There has been no formal discussion of this _
that I am aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic raised the question of his future last summer, after
the war over Kosovo ended, officials say. But Washington rebuffed
any discussion of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Various proposals have been raised to Washington and Athens,
Greece, in recent weeks by emissaries saying they come from
Milosevic, the officials said. But what is less clear is whether
they are fully authorized, and whether Milosevic is serious about
reaching a deal or is simply trying to ``see how the ground lies,''
a U.S. official said. ``What we would never do is make him an
offer, because he'll just pocket it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any deal, even without clear U.S. fingerprints, would also put
Vice President Al Gore in a difficult position during the
presidential campaign and could undermine the international
tribunal that indicted Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear why Milosevic would choose to leave power
now, the officials caution. While his position is slowly
disintegrating, along with Yugoslavia's economy, his current seat
is probably the safest place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for him to trust assurances from anyone,
inside or outside the country,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Within his ruling party, Milosevic has said that it is important
to wait out the Clinton administration, and that a President George
W. Bush would be more ``realistic'' toward Yugoslavia and carry
less personal animosity stemming from the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton raised the issue of Milosevic's future
with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at their recent summit
meeting, Russian officials have told some officials of NATO
countries. According to the Russians, Putin told Clinton that Miami
seemed as good a place for Milosevic as Moscow, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has six months left in office. It has
made the ouster of Milosevic one of its main policy goals and it
regards him as the central obstacle to democratization and
stability in southeastern Europe and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has told her top aides she
wants Milosevic out of office before she goes, yet Milosevic has
frustrated Washington, maneuvering to keep his position and
outflank the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is keen interest in these proposals in Washington,''
said an official of a NATO country. ``They can't be seen to be
shopping. But they are sending signals that should a clear proposal
come, it would be seriously entertained. And that shows they're
serious. If you write about it, it will be full denial. But it's
the best solution for everyone, and they could spin it as victory,
as his head on a platter. There is a strong argument that democracy
should be put ahead of the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece is one of the countries actively exploring the
possibility of a deal for Milosevic's ouster, which could mean
exile abroad for him and his family or, less likely, pledges of
safety inside Yugoslavia from any successor government that
promises not to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Greece, which has close ties to the Serbs, provided
humanitarian aid to Serbia and Kosovo even during the air war and
has acted as a go-between for NATO and Belgrade in the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month Milosevic saw the former Greek foreign minister
Karolos Papoulias and some important Greek businessmen, including
some with close ties to the United States. Milosevic is said to
have asked to see former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis,
whom he trusts, but officials say they are looking for more signals
of seriousness from Belgrade before Mitsotakis is authorized to go
to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic is beleaguered and unpopular, and the country is
having severe economic problems, the Serbian opposition is weak and
there are no signs of potential insurrection. The army and the
police have not cracked. Russia and China, which opposed NATO's use
of force in Kosovo and which have interests in Yugoslavia, have
been willing to help Milosevic and his government with credits,
loans and energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the officials say, Milosevic is showing signs
of nervousness. He is not seeing a broad range of people or
traveling widely inside the country. There is evidence of a grain
shortage that will drive up food prices and there has been a series
of assassinations of senior officials and criminal leaders, none of
them solved, that indicates instability.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is becoming a more widespread movement inside
Serbia, with opinion polls showing a growing desire for change and
an end to international isolation, even if the current leaders of
the opposition are not popular themselves.
</P>
<P>
   International sanctions against Yugoslavia are becoming better
coordinated and seem to be biting those close to the regime. Last
week, officials say, Cyprus, a favored spot for Serbian money and
money-laundering, finally agreed to shut down the office of
Beogradska Banka on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his family are believed to have large amounts of
money in foreign banks, although the size and location of the
holdings are not known.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seems tired and irritable, the officials say, and they
note that his speeches have a kind of ideological fury more
reminiscent of the views of his influential wife, Mirjana Markovic,
a professor of sociology who founded the Yugoslav United Left
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his own party are said to be looking beyond him, and the
security of his family _ especially his son, Marko, who is involved
in a wide range of business activities _ is a concern. Marko
Milosevic, although on a list of individuals banned from travel to
European Union countries, was recently in Greece on a false
diplomatic passport, one official said, and is now believed to be
in Japan, possibly on his way to China.
</P>
<P>
   As for Milosevic's conviction that a Bush administration would
be more realistic and less emotional toward him, a Bush foreign
policy adviser cautioned that there was no agreed policy, and that
the situation in Yugoslavia could change a lot in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Milosevic should take no comfort from the prospect of a
Bush administration,'' the adviser said. ``There will be no sense
of letting bygones be bygones. The strategy may change in different
ways, and it will be worked out with the Europeans. But the idea
that a bunch of Kissingerian realpolitikers will focus energy
elsewhere and let him mind his own business is not something he
should bank on.''

   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Lorraine Lacaillade, a 75-year-old widow in
Bolton, about 25 miles southeast of here, lives on about $12,000 a
year, most of it from Social Security. She takes prescription drugs
for arthritis and other conditions that would cost more than $1,000
a year if she had to pay for them herself.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Vermont, a state in the vanguard of offering health
benefits to its residents. Under the Vermont Health Access Plan, a
program for people who are earning just enough to make ends meet,
Lacaillade only pays $3 a month for her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is awfully expensive today,'' she said. ``The old
people need some help.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the prevailing philosophy here, embraced by the
Democratic governor, state legislators from both parties, doctors
and, clearly, the public.
</P>
<P>
   The array of health benefits that Vermont provides its residents
_ not just the elderly but also children and low-income adults _ is
unmatched by any other state.
</P>
<P>
   And while many of Vermont's programs would not work in larger
and more urban states, other aspects could serve as models. Today,
93.5 percent of all Vermont residents have health insurance,
including essentially all children. By contrast, only 63 percent of
low-income children in Texas and 60 percent in Arizona are insured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view that health insurance ought to be universal, the
right of every citizen in Vermont,'' Gov. Howard Dean said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program called Dr. Dynasaur (some marketing wizard
thought up the odd spelling), the state has guaranteed free medical
and dental care to every resident age 18 and younger from a family
with income below about $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Adults with income below 150 percent of the federal poverty line
are entitled to medical coverage for a nominal fee. The poverty
line, for instance, is $8,350 this year for a single person and
$17,050 for a family of four. That means a single adult with less
than $12,500 is eligible, as is a family of four with less than
$25,500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, health insurance companies are required to sell
policies to residents who request one, and must provide them at the
same cost to all customers, regardless of their age or medical
history.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what this can mean for a family: Gary and Sheila Clayton
live in Burlington, barely making ends meet. He is a glazier for a
company that does commercial and residential glass work. She works
part time as a clerk in a doctor's office. They have three
children, 12, 10 and 5. If they took family health insurance
through Clayton's employer, it would cost $89 a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clayton children are covered by the Dr. Dynasaur
program. And under the Vermont program for families with incomes
only slightly above the poverty line, the couple pay only $40 every
six months for their own coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley, the 5-year-old, was born, he spent a week in the
hospital in the neonatal care unit. The hospital bill was almost
$10,000; Dr. Dynasaur paid all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Dean, a Democrat, and his wife, Judy Steinberg, are
physicians, and the generous health benefits are largely his doing.
</P>
<P>
   He took office in 1991 determined to pass legislation that in
one fell swoop would provide health coverage to everyone in
Vermont. His bill was similar to the one offered by the Clinton
administration in 1993, and it was defeated in the state
Legislature in 1994, just months before the Clinton plan died in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So Dean began implementing the plan gradually _ extending
coverage to low-income adults in one year, providing drug coverage
to the elderly in another, expanding coverage for children in yet
another. This year, 28,600 elderly and disabled Vermont residents,
about one-third of those on Medicare, receive drug coverage under
the state program. The Dr. Dynasaur program covers 55,000 of the
state's 145,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now realize that the only way you can do this is
incrementally,'' Dean said. ``You do it piece by piece and bit by
bit because you can't take on every special interest all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the cost of the expanded benefits is picked up by
Washington under the Medicaid program. But the state's share is
considerable, which is why other states have not adopted similar
measures.
</P>
<P>
   With advances in health benefits paralyzed in Washington because
of partisan warfare, Dean has accomplished his goals with little
Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is not a partisan issue in Vermont,'' said John
Bloomer Jr., a Republican leader in the state Senate. ``Generally
speaking, it's a bipartisan goal to expand health care access and
affordability.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is hardly typical. It is a rural state with a population
of about 591,000, less than Milwaukee's. Ninety-eight percent of
the residents are white, and few people move into the state. The
poverty rate is somewhat below the national average, but so are
wages and per capita income.
</P>
<P>
   Dean conceded that if Vermont were less remote, his program of
requiring insurance companies to offer health insurance at the same
rates to everyone would not work. People with serious, chronic
illnesses would move in just for the insurance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But larger states could learn from parts of the Vermont
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, for instance, Vermont had a serious problem
with teen-age pregnancy. Now, it has the lowest rate of adolescent
pregnancy in the nation. The governor credits the Dr. Dynasaur
program for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph F. Hagan Jr., a pediatrician in Burlington, was not
willing to give all the credit to the program, but he said it
certainly made a difference. For one thing, Hagan said, teen-age
girls go to the doctor more often now than they did when they had
to pay for it, and they get counseling and sex education. For
another, the program pays for birth-control pills and other
contraceptives. Girls can get them without their parents having to
pay the bill _ in fact, without their parents even knowing.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with the elderly said they could also see the
difference since the state's health programs became more extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't have the insurance, they wouldn't take their
medicine,'' said John Barbour, executive director of the Champlain
Valley Agency on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not without drawbacks. Take the case of the
Cookson family in Huntington, a small community east of here. Owen
Cookson is a construction foreman who made good money with overtime
in the summer and little in the winter. Marie Cookson works out of
their small A-frame house preparing income tax returns. They have
three children. Cookson has $50 a week withheld from his paycheck
for employer-provided health insurance that starts after a $4,000
annual family deductible has been met.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Nathan, 12, had to go to the emergency room recently
with an inflammation. That bill was $400, and the family faces
hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in bills for additional
tests.
</P>
<P>
   If this had happened in the winter, the bills would have been
paid by Dr. Dynasaur, which covers deductibles and copayments for
families with private insurance. But eligibility is calculated
monthly, and Cookson earned enough in May, one of the months when
construction work is plentiful, to push the family's monthly income
beyond qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a lot of money we're paying out,'' Mrs.
Cookson said. ``And we can hardly afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are also concerned. Dr. Thomas A.E. Moseley, a
pediatrician at a rural health clinic in Newport near the Canadian
border, said he had seen a huge difference because of Dr. Dynasaur
in the number of children receiving preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Holy Grail of pediatrics,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   But 75 percent of his practice involves Dr. Dynasaur patients.
He is paid at the Medicaid rate, which is often not enough to cover
his costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed blessing,'' Moseley said. ``The problem is far
from being solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean is also worried. The costs of the health benefits are
rising. Drug costs alone are rising at a rate of 18 percent a year.
The state has a budget surplus now. But if the economy turns sour,
the governor says, he may have to ask the more affluent families on
the Dr. Dynasaur program to make copayments.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he said, he hoped to install a program that would
allow everyone in the state with income below 300 percent of the
poverty level to get prescription drugs at the same lower rate paid
by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it another incremental step.

BIG BONUS FOR ANGELS' FIRST-ROUND PICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE -- The Angels announced Sunday they signed first-round
draft pick Joe Torres, a left-handed pitcher from Gateway High
School in Kissimmee, Fla. Torres received a signing bonus believed
to be worth about $2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who was the 10th pick overall in the draft June 5, has
been assigned to Single-A Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Torres won't turn 18 until Sept. 3, but Angels scouting director
Donny Rowland isn't concerned about Torres' youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a highly-confident, highly-experience 17-year-old,''
Rowland said. ``He's played at a high level for a long time. Any
time you take a high school pitcher in the first round, you assume
risks. But if you assume the risks, you believe the return will be
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his youth, Torres has international experience. He
played on the USA youth national team, which won a gold medal in
1998, and on the USA junior national team in 1999. He was the
winning pitcher in the USA's victory over Chinese Taipei in the
1999 gold-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   Torres signed a letter-of-intent to attend the University of
Miami, but made it clear after he was drafted he was more
interested in pitching professionally right away.
</P>
<P>
   As for what he'll do with his signing bonus, Torres said he's
``saving it for a rainy day. The big money's in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres will be in Anaheim Tuesday to meet the media, the team
and watch the Angels play the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Torres went 4-4 with a 0.38 ERA in 11 games his senior season at
Gateway High, striking out 128 in only 55 innings. In his four
losses, he threw a no-hitter, two one-hitters and a two-hitter. In
his high school career, he was 14-15 with a 1.58 ERA. Baseball
America magazine ranked Torres the No. 3 high school prospect in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Troy Percival has gone back to using a high leg kick
during his delivery, something he abandoned in recent years because
of his arm and shoulder problems. But because he is feeling
stronger now after off-season shoulder surgery, Percival has
returned to the delivery he used so successfully in 1995 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of violent but I'm getting strong enough to go back
to it,'' Percival said. ``It's more deceptive to hitters, they see
my body flying all over. The last 2 years guys were taking pretty
good hacks off me as opposed to recently. (Sunday) nobody was able
to take a good hack off me.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival pitched the ninth inning for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia's approach to using the designated hitter
spot is different than most managers. Instead of using an aging
player who might have some power, Scioscia is using it as a
semi-day off for a regular player, while putting either Scott
Spiezio, Orlando Palmeiro or Edgard Clemente in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio, Palmeiro or Clemente might also get a start as the DH,
but Scioscia likes to mix and match depending on that particular
day's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a full-time DH,'' Scioscia said. ``Each guy
brings something different to the lineup. Orlando's a great
situational player this club needs. Spiezio has some power.
Clemente can hit left-handers. All three play good defense are are
versatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beautiful thing about the American League -- a guy
can get rest and still get his at-bats. It's important for guys to
be in there, whether it's the DH or playing the field.''

U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CERTIFIES ISRAEL'S WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH
LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After 16 hours of deadlock, the U.N. Security
Council Sunday gave a qualified endorsement of Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's certification on Friday that Israel has withdrawn from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it expressed concern over Beirut's charges that
the Israelis continue to encroach on Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
   The council's endorsement is important because it opens the way
to stationing U.N. peacekeepers across southern Lebanon and
authorizes them to help the Lebanese government restore its
authority in the often chaotic border region.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who is visiting the Middle East, threatened to scrap his
visit to Lebanon, scheduled Monday, if the council declined to
support his confirmation of the withdrawal, which was based on
field inspections by U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats said Lebanon complained that Israel violated its
border as recently as Sunday, driving equipment across to build a
fence. Lebanon has also accused the Israelis of holding on to
patches of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of any Israeli soldier inside the Lebanese
borders would mean the violation of the borders drawn by the
U.N.,'' Annan said Sunday in Cairo, Egypt. He promised to refer any
such violation to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the council convened to consider a statement
approving Annan's certification of the Israeli withdrawal, but
failed to reach consensus after 10 hours of discussions. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright intervened, organizing a
conference call that linked President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon with
Annan's special envoy for the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, at
the United Nations, and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen told the Secuity Council that without its
endorsement, Annan would cancel his visit to Lebanon. Annan
conveyed the same message to Lahoud, officials and other diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a further six hours of consulations Sunday, the council
finally produced a statement that ``welcomed'' the
secretary-general's report, but also endorsed the work done by the
U.N. verification teams.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the endorsement looked bleak Sunday morning, after
Russia asked that the council members return to consultations and
seek further clarification of Lebanon's complaints. Some diplomats
said that Russia instructed its delegation not to override
Lebanon's objections. Russia wields veto power in the council,
precluding adoption of a meaningful statement without its support.
</P>
<P>
   To end the stalemate, the French and British delegations crafted
a new sentence addressing Lebanon's complaints. It said that ``the
council notes with serious concern reports of violations that have
occurred'' since Friday, and it called upon all parties ``to
respect the line as identified by the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of the council's endorsement would not only have
embarrassed the secretary-general, but would also have undermined
the credibility of his current Middle East visit. Annan has said he
hoped to use the momentum of the Israeli withdrawal to galvanize
other stalled peace talks in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who arrived in Cairo this evening from Tehran, Iran, is
scheduled to meet Lahoud and Lebanon Prime Minister Salim Hoss in
Beirut on Monday, and also to visit the U.N. peacekeeping mission
at its headquarters at Naqura, in southwestern Lebanon. Annan is
later expected to go to Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen, who supervised the complex process of verifying
Israel's withdrawal , said Friday that the U.N. mission in southern
Lebanon will be expanded to 5,600 peacekeepers from the current
4,400. They are to set up fixed positions along the border and
conduct regular patrols, The numbers of U.N. peacekeepers could
eventually swell to 8,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen postponed his own visit to Beirut this weekend to
remain available here for the Security Council. In the course of
the verification, he met regularly with senior officials of
Lebanon, Israel and Syria, among other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. inspection teams checked the length of the 72-mile
border before reporting to Annan on Friday that the Israelis had
withdrawn. But within hours, Hoss asserted that Lebanese
specialists accompanying the inspectors had witnessed Israeli
encroachments. Lahoud separately called Annan's confirmation of the
withdrawal inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, in its statement Sunday, called upon the
Lebanese government and armed forces to move faster to take control
of southern Lebanon. The statement said that the council would
review whether to extend the peacekeeping mission's mandate at the
end of July. It pointedly noted that, ``The United Nations cannot
assume law and order functions which are properly the
responsibility of the Government of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that France, which contributes troops to the
peacekeeping mission, wants Lebanon to assume responsibility for
what has become a lawless region rather than leave it to the United
Nations.

COMMENTARY: THE KGB COUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I had breakfast recently with the deputy chief of
Media-Most, the last major Russian TV-and-newspaper company to dare
criticize or satirize the men who have ``democratically'' seized
power in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Malashenko was at first unusually guarded, speaking as if
being overheard by the new KGB. I asked: What's with the clamming
up? He responded by asking if I carried a cell phone. Sure, I said,
but it was turned off; I prefer to be out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   He asked to see it. ``To be powered off is not good enough,'' he
said, and took out the battery. ``Now it cannot be used to bug
either of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such precautions are now taken by many in the Russian media who
know they are under surveillance by Vladimir Putin's KGB no matter
where they go.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners who never worked or covered events in the former
Soviet Union consider that paranoid. They have not been afflicted
with the stifling feeling of being watched and listened to in
hotels, offices, parks and cars. But after a decade of blessed free
speech in Russia, repressive days are here again.
</P>
<P>
   Step One in the KGB's coup took place last year, as the last of
Boris Yeltsin's string of somewhat reformist prime ministers was
replaced by an unknown KGB apparatchik. Vladimir Putin was
hand-picked by the band of oligarchs who wanted to maintain iron
control of Russia's economy; they made a deal with the corrupt
``family'' around Yeltsin, which wanted a promise of no prosecution
if their figurehead handed over power to a Kremlin-loyal KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two was a get-even war against the hated Chechens. Its
popularity was ensured by the mysterious blowing-up of Russian
apartment buildings, for which the secret police promptly blamed
Chechen terrorists. Some defector may one day reveal it was a
classic KGB active-measures propaganda operation; if so, the
explosions did the trick of catapulting the KGB's Putin to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three was to avoid a genuinely contested presidential
election. With his amnesty deal made, Yeltsin resigned and named as
acting president the KGB man chosen by the kingmaker Boris
Berezovsky and approved by family and generals. Putin then ran for
election from the seat of power in the Kremlin, in control of
government-owned media and able to sprinkle back pay on
worker-voters.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Most of the media was cowed; politicians outside
Kremlin walls were inundated with vilification. In the West, those
whom Lenin reportedly called ``useful idiots'' were enlisted to
embrace the coup's choice as a much-needed strongman to do business
with. As opposition was systematically discredited and crushed,
Berezovsky's selection was called an election.
</P>
<P>
   Mopping up followed. A Radio Liberty newsman, Andrei Babitsky,
reported all too accurately about continued Russian casualties in
Chechnya. Putin's men seized him and turned him over to quislings
for quieting; the new president passed public judgment that the
reporter was a ``traitor,'' and ever since the framed-up Babitsky
has been a victim of prosecutorial silencing.
</P>
<P>
   This emboldened coup leaders to turn on a far more powerful
media figure: Vladimir Gusinsky, head of Media-Most. His channel's
newscasters do not hew to the Kremlin line and his satiric puppet
show aims barbs at the new strongman and the Kremlin palace guard.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all for Putin's persecution purposes, Gusinsky is a Jew;
unlike Berezovsky and some partners in Oligarchy Inc., he is not
the self-hating, religion-denying kind. Anti-Semites applauded the
KGB raid on Media-Most's offices to grab files and cheered last
week when the stiffnecked Jew was arrested and thrown in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who surely approved the general order to break press
resistance, professed ignorance. The Blair-Clinton-Schoder
thirdwayniks issued mild bleats of ``concern.'' Oligarchs next on
Berezovsky's list complained.
</P>
<P>
   With their chilling point made, Putin's repression crew has let
the bothersome Jew out of jail for now but ordered Gusinsky to stay
in Moscow while an embezzlement case against him is trumped up.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, freedom of speech. Thirdwayniks take note: When doing
business with the KGB coup's chosen leader, better take the
batteries out of your cell phones.

SEAGRAM AND VIVENDI EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE $33 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vivendi and the Seagram Co. are preparing to vote Monday on
Vivendi's purchase of Seagram for roughly $33 billion in stock. The
companies' boards met over the weekend to discuss the deal, and an
agreement could be announced by the end of the day or Tuesday
morning, according to a person close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi owns 49 percent of Canal Plus, the French pay television
company, and that company's board is also expected to meet Monday
to approve the Seagram acquisition. Canal Plus is a public company
and French law requires that it approve any merger undertaken by
Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to equity of roughly $33 billion, Vivendi is
expected to assume $6.6 billion in Seagram debt.
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to Seagram board members said Edgar Bronfman
Jr., Seagram's chief executive, had pushed for a final vote as
early as Monday, but that some directors were reluctant to move
that rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bronfman, Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s uncle and a director, has
been reducing his stake in Seagram, and there have been reports
that he is not happy with the company's performance. One of the
people with knowledge of the board said Charles Bronfman did not
want to vote on a sale as quickly as his nephew hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Edgar Bronfman Jr. had misgivings about
selling the company founded by his father and about the real value
of Vivendi's stock, according to a third executive with knowledge
of the board. Nevertheless, this person said, it still seemed quite
likely the deal would go through. Bronfman could not be reached,
and a Seagram spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's board meeting began at 11 a.m. in New York and
continued for six hours, according to a person with knowledge of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The final price of the deal is still being negotiated, a person
close to the talks said, in part because Vivendi's stock has fallen
14 percent, to $94.40, since word of the deal leaked out last
Tuesday. But the price is expected to be around $75 a share.
Seagram shareholders are likely to get a collar _ a feature
limiting how much the deal price can vary _ if Vivendi's stock
falls further. Seagram stock closed at $61.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Bronfman Jr. is set to become vice chairman of the new
company under Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier. Bronfman
plans to commute from New York to Vivendi headquarters in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi has indicated that it will sell all or part of Seagram's
liquor business to reduce or eliminate Seagram's debt. Vivendi also
plans to sell roughly 30 percent of its water business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its stake in Canal Plus, Vivendi is the
second-largest cellular telephone and telephone operator in France,
and it has a joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch to create a
mobile Internet portal in Europe. Seagram owns Universal Studios,
several theme parks, a record company and a leading liquor
operation.

LOS ANGELES NEEDS THIS TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Today's sermonette is written on behalf of the Los
Angeles Lakers, who will go into Game 6 of the NBA Finals tonight
with the weight of the city on their athletic shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Let us quote the great writer Joseph Conrad, who journeyed the
globe in search of whatever answers lingers in the soul of man.
</P>
<P>
   From his extraordinary ``Heart of Darkness,'' which was also
translated into the film ``Apocalypse Now'' by Martin Scorcese.
</P>
<P>
   (set ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out,
disgust simply does not exist where hunger is. And as to
superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are
less than chaff in a breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   I believe Phil Jackson would agree, and perhaps approve.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is hungry and parched for victory. It has been 12
years since a professional team sent a banner up a flagpole, a
dozen years since the Lakers and Dodgers both won 1998 titles and
reinforced the belief that the good times in L.A. would roll on
forever. But since, we have seen far too many teams fall short of
success, including this Laker team we tentatively embrace.
</P>
<P>
   In those dirty dozen years, a hero named Magic Johnson was
forced to retire prematurely. The Kings went to the Stanley Cup
finals, then their owner went to prison. The Dodgers stuttered in
several pennant races before being sold and sullied. The Rams and
Raiders went to the supermarket and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   And while UCLA did win a college basketball title in 1995, the
subsequent demise of Jim Harrick robbed that flag of its sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, it can be said without lapsing into hyperbole: Los
Angeles needs a victory.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter a bit that the Lakers have needed 23 games,
including tonight, to win a title, more games than San Antonio
needed last year (17), more games than the Chicago Bulls needed in
their six titles years (21, 19, 18, 19, 22 and 17, respectively,
counting backwards). Only one other champ has needed 23 games since
the end of the Magic-Larry Bird era, the 1994 Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that the Lakers have been unable to put teams
away, that they are 3-6 in closeout games. They lost twice to
Sacramento after opening 2-0, once to Phoenix after a 3-0 start,
blew serve twice to Portland after a 3-1 advantage, and once to
Indiana on Friday, two days after playing perhaps their best game
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Shaquille O'Neal brings a 40 percent
free-throw shooting average into Game 6, or that renown free throw
misser Wilt Chamberlain shot better than that in 10 of his 13
playoff seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that the Lakers lost Game 5 by 33 points, the
franchise's biggest playoff loss since 1985, and 14 points more
than any loss suffered by Jackson since he started coaching
champions in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Kobe Bryant went from Air-worthy in Game
4 of the finals to air-ball in Game 5, because we all know how
talented and important he is, and all of those comparisons are
tired, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that the Hack-a-Shaq has taken the NBA's
Miami-versus-New York-induced thuggery to new lows, and introduced
the three-hour game to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Jackson himself has said this team often lacks ``a
championship quality,'' or that Ron Harper said any of the Bulls
teams he played on ``would have beaten the crap out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what Mrs. Glen Rice has to say about her
husband's playing time, because your options in any offense (ital)
should (end) favor a 315-pound center who can dunk and a slashing
21-year-old who can create, over a 20-foot jumper by a mercurial
shooter who views defense as personal down time.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't even matter that Jackson will likely tear this team
up after the finals, wins or lose, that the Lakers could role out
two or three new starters next season.
</P>
<P>
   It only matters that the Lakers win. That's what an Oscar-worthy
crowd will want when Game 6 tips at Staples Center. Aesthetics do
not mater.
</P>
<P>
   From the ever-present Jack Nicholson and rapt Denzel Washington
to photo opportunists like Selma Hayek and Arnold Schwarzeneggar,
from every longtime Laker fan who has endured high blood pressure
following the team the last four season, it only matters that they
win. By one point or 21. By silencing Reggie Miller with blanket
coverage or watching him suffer another 1-for-16 night.
</P>
<P>
   Never have the words so often used by another opportunist and
former L.A. sports carpetbagger, Al Davis, been more true and
important.
</P>
<P>
   Just win, baby. How isn't important. Win, and we will bury any
and all facets of the past that have been waved in your face.
</P>
<P>
   No more references to Shaq's previous bowouts. No more lectures
on his free throws. No more seminars contrasting and comparing Kobe
Bryant to Michael Jordan. A full pardon regarding Ron Harper's
Clippers career. No more questions about Robert Horry's state of
mind. No more virgin jokes for A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dying of thirst by the side of the fountain,'' wrote
Charles d'Orleans, way back in the 15th Century. It only seems like
six centuries ago since L.A. last quenched its thirst. The Lakers
have their hand on the faucet. For the good of L.A., let's hope
they turn it on tonight.

WHITE SOX POUND HERNANDEZ FOR A SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez trudged a few feet behind the
mound, allowed a new ball to tumble out of his glove and crouched
down like a catcher. El Duque stared at the grass below his cleats
for about 10 seconds that felt more like 10 minutes. Hernandez
looked uncomfortable. Everyone on the Yankees felt uneasy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin had just smashed a grand slam and the White Sox
already had nine runs in the first inning when Hernandez dropped
the ball, lowered his head and waited for the inevitable. Manager
Joe Torre was fast approaching and the boos were escalating so El
Duque stood, scooped up the ball, handed it to Torre and ended his
brief debacle with a wounded ego and an injured right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle was not brief for the rest of the Yankees. It
stretched across nine torturous innings, culminating in a 17-4 loss
to the White Sox. On Saturday, the Yankees had rallied from an 8-0
deficit before losing, 10-9, but they had no dramatic rallies on
this gray, gloomy day and were swept in a four-game series at
Yankee Stadium for the first time since the White Sox did it in
July 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it's embarrassing,'' Torre said, ``but you
sure don't like getting your butt kicked like we have over this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were despondent after the White Sox outscored them
by 42-17 in the series, with Torre referring to this slide as ``a
blow to the organization'' and General Manager Brian Cashman
saying, ``We're playing as bad as we can play.'' The anxiety
increased because El Duque was sent to Beth Israel North Hospital
for X-rays and a magnetic resonance imaging test on his sore elbow.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees called the tests precautionary, any injury to
Hernandez should be disturbing for a team that already has Roger
Clemens on the disabled list. Hernandez missed a start in May with
a muscle strain in his upper back, but this is the first time the
Yankees' leading winner has complained about his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not his day to begin with, and it was compounded
because he felt something,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have held repeated discussions about acquiring the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa or Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, and this
drought could intensify the owner George Steinbrenner's desire to
improve the team. After losing for the sixth time in seven games,
the Yankees (34-29) remained a half game behind the first-place Red
Sox, whom they play in a four-game series starting Monday night in
Boston. But, suddenly, the Blue Jays trail the Yankees by a half
game.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman reiterated that there were more quality position players
available than pitchers and acknowledged that the Yankees' poor
play could make a trade tougher to execute. The Yankees are hanging
on and are fortunate that the other teams in the American League
East have also been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dropping 16 of 28 games, the Yankees have gained a half
game. Still, the standings cannot hide a struggling team that was
down by 9-0 after one inning, by 12-0 after two and by 16-0 after
five. The Yankees had not allowed nine in a first inning since
1979, and the White Sox had not scored nine in a first in 38 years.
Derek Jeter was 16 the last time the Yankees were battered for 17
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it concerns you,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``You don't
want someone to come in and embarrass you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (6-6) looked as if he might have hurt himself on the
first batter of the game. He sprinted to cover first on Ray
Durham's grounder to Tino Martinez and jumped for the base,
buckling as he landed and perhaps hurting his back.
</P>
<P>
   Then the devastation began. After Hernandez walked Valentin,
Frank Thomas laced a booming double to make the score 1-0. El Duque
walked a batter and Paul Konerko singled home a run, prompting an
injury visit from Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. Hernandez
told Stottlemyre that he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Singleton smashed a two-run double and Carlos Lee
singled in a run to put the Yankees in a 5-0 hole. Hernandez was
not fine. His fastball was limping and his usually impeccable
control was awry. El Duque threw first pitch balls to 6 of 11
batters and went to four three-ball counts, which resulted in three
walks and the grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez tugged on his jersey, adjusted his cap and dug around
the dirt, searching for a comfort zone. He gave up two singles to
the next three batters and later told Torre he first felt pain in
his elbow on the No. 9 batter Mark Johnson's single.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though Stottlemyre and Jorge Posada both quizzed
Hernandez on how he felt, he continued pitching. Hernandez threw 11
pitches after feeling the pain, walking Durham and surrendering
Valentin's grand slam on a weak 3-2 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know he's hurt, you don't dare'' let him pitch, Torre
said. ``I'm sorry he went two more hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Hernandez toil for two thirds of an inning shocked some
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they were getting cheap hits,'' Jeter said.
``It was like a couple of guys on and `Bam!' A couple of guys on
and `Bam!' Before you knew it, it was 9-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you knew it, the Yankees had flopped again. Torre
speculated that teams are bound to get even with the Yankees after
they dominated baseball for three of the last four years. That
trend might be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've enjoyed ourselves for four years,'' Torre said. ``We're
on our heels and we need to bounce back. We sort of know now what
other clubs felt when they played us.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the features most responsible for America Online's
success has been the buddy list _ the small box on the computer
screen showing a user which friends are logged on and available for
an instant online conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is testing the power of buddyship even more.
Monday it will introduce AOLTV, the centerpiece of the company's
AOL Anywhere strategy to move beyond the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   AOLTV, like Microsoft's WebTV, is a black box enabling people to
surf the Internet on their television screens. But with only 1
million subscribers after three years, Web TV has been a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   So AOLTV, in contrast, is being marketed for its use to existing
America Online members who want to keep access to their e-mail,
chat rooms and buddy list while watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Push one button on the AOLTV wireless keyboard, and the same
buddy-list window from the PC-based service will appear in
translucent letters over the television image. One more click can
start a chat with someone, whether they are on AOLTV or on their
computer, or soon, on their AOL-enabled cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Want new friends? Push a different button, and you're in a chat
room with people watching the same show. The TV image, reduced,
remains in a corner of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   America Online says that many people have computers in their
family rooms so they can chat while watching television, and AOLTV
will make this easier.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also gambling that prospective customers are willing
to pay $249 for a set-top box, made by Philips, and connect it to
the cable box and the video recorder, as well as to a phone line.
Subscribers will also have to pay an additional $15 a month if they
are already AOL members or $26 a month if they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a stretch that chat and instant messaging will
drive all these people to attach another box to their television
set, said Josh Bernoff, an interactive-television analyst with
Forrester Research. ``Fifteen dollars is a lot of money, plus it
uses another phone line, and the value people are getting is
relatively low.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schuler, the president of AOL's interactive services, is
unapologetic about the price. ``AOL is a premium product,'' he
said. ``We don't sell AOL on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said he expects it to catch on with consumers slowly,
selling a few hundred thousand units in the first year. ``If you
look at the history of consumer electronics, it takes 10 years for
a new platform to become established,'' he said. ``If this category
was started with WebTV, we're only two years in.''
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledges that there are better ways to deliver this
service than by putting another black box on top of the television
set. AOL has already announced a deal to combine AOLTV with the
TiVo video recorder and another to incorporate it into the set-top
box used to decode the DirecTV satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   With America Online buying Time Warner, there are plans for a
version built into that company's cable television boxes. Cable,
but not satellite, offers the advantage of two-way communication,
eliminating the need for another phone line.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, AOL will simply try to sell the existing
Philips box through Time Warner's cable unit.
</P>
<P>
   But Schuler says that even the current configuration will have a
following among families where several children have developed the
habit of chatting online with their friends so much that fights
erupt over access to the computer. For the more affluent of these
households, he reckons, an additional phone line and the AOLTV
service may be a better way to keep the peace than buying another
computer.
</P>
<P>
   With the audience likely to be small for the foreseeable future,
America Online has not sold any advertising yet, but it has built
in lots of potential for commerce. There is a shopping channel.
There is the ability for broadcast networks to add shopping content
to their programs, splitting revenue with America Online. (Click to
buy Oprah's book club selection, for example.) And ads are
sprinkled through an elaborate, searchable on-screen program guide.
America Online figures the biggest buyer will be TV networks trying
to attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also created ``channels'' on sports, weather and
news that mix text information, advertising, and a small video
window. It plans to auction off the rights to television networks
to be the featured program.

METS HELP REED STEER CLEAR OF TROUBLE THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The first injury came in Japan, when the automatic
door on a taxicab conked him on the knee. Then came a stiff neck
against Los Angeles, a numb foot in Philadelphia, a bruised hand
against Milwaukee and a pulled muscle in his side in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept fighting, fighting and fighting,'' said the Mets
right-hander Rick Reed, who escaped Sunday's start without injury
and with a 7-3 victory over the Brewers. ``Finally, my past two
outings have been fine with me, right where I want to be. Each time
out's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed worked seven innings, allowing three runs on seven hits and
a walk. He had no decision in each of his previous six starts _
``That's unreal; I don't want to go through that again,'' he said _
but earned a victory Sunday, his first since April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard smacked a leadoff home run off Reed. But the first
hitter in Reed's last start against the Brewers inflicted more
damage. In that game, at Shea Stadium on April 19, Marquis Grissom
led off by smashing a liner off Reed's glove hand. Reed went on to
pitch seven strong innings for a victory, but his wrist and palm
were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   He could not make a fist or slide his hand into his glove for
several days, and the pain disrupted his sleep. Reed missed a start
and, as he struggled over the next month, he changed his mechanics
to protect his hand when he got into fielding position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into some bad habits with my front shoulder, and that
started elevating the ball in the strike zone,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   That was not a problem Sunday for Reed, who trailed by 1-0 after
Belliard's homer but pitched with a lead for most of the game,
courtesy of the Mets' five-run fourth inning against Jason Bere.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco led off with a single and scored on Mike Piazza's
double, and Jay Payton drove in another run with a sacrifice fly.
After Benny Agbayani beat the throw to first base on what would
have been an inning-ending double play, Kurt Abbott bashed an
off-speed pitch for a three-run home run that traveled an estimated
405 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was starting for the first time since Tuesday, when he
made a throwing error that brought in the Chicago Cubs' winning
run. Abbott admitted wondering why he was not in Manager Bobby
Valentine's lineup the next three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's normal,'' he said. ``Of course. When you want
to play and you're not in there, you have reason to ask, `How come
I'm not in there?' But he's the manager and he makes out the lineup
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine told Abbott and Melvin Mora they would share the
playing time while shortstop Rey Ordonez was out with a broken
forearm, but he never mentioned who would play when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the hot hand,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, whose second single helped the Mets score their sixth
run, has a better idea when he will start: every 10 or 11 days. He
had not started since June 3, so he had a feeling he would today.
</P>
<P>
   He has seven hits in 20 at-bats in his six starts, for a .350
average. When he does not start, he is six for 40, .150. But Franco
has felt comfortable with his swing all season and was a little
embarrassed that a two-hit day would be notable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I feel and I know what I'm seeing, and I know I can
hit what I'm seeing,'' Franco said. ``I've hit .280 many times and
felt worse than I do now.''

KNOBLAUCH HAS OTHER THINGS ON HIS MIND BESIDES THROWING PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The emotions were swirling again for Chuck Knoblauch
Sunday before the New York Yankees' 17-4 loss to the Chicago White
Sox, confusing emotions that he has conceded will not soon vanish.
Knoblauch is the second baseman who does not understand why his
throws to first base sometimes act like paper airplanes, sailing
without any direction.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged his shoulders and scrunched his face when he
casually fielded questions. He spoke about the difficulty of having
an ailing father on Father's Day, about being unable to persuade
his mother to visit him from Texas and about how any progress he
makes in combating his problem will probably be incremental.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys see the baseball stuff,'' Knoblauch said. ``It might
not be a baseball thing. It probably isn't. It's probably something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch suggested that he received some sort of treatment to
deal with his chronic throwing problems following the 1999 season,
but he has refused to discuss what he might have done. He has
ignored the reams of unsolicited advice he has received and snapped
his fingers to indicate that, if this were a trivial problem, it
would have been solved by now.
</P>
<P>
   While Knoblauch has acknowledged that he will undergo some
treatment, he has refused to disclose whether it will be with a
sports psychologist. When he was asked why he was reluctant to talk
about what he might have done to address the problem previously,
the second baseman bristled slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you do this winter?'' he said, repeating a reporter's
question. ``The winter is personal. I know people want to know, but
I don't think I should talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch fielded two grounders Sunday in the five innings he
played and tossed soft, accurate throws to first both times, which
caused the fans to explode in applause. As gracious as it was for
fans to cheer for Knoblauch, he would obviously prefer it if a
routine throw did not attract intense attention.
</P>
<P>
   When Knoblauch whipped a ball into the stands on Saturday, it
struck Marie Olbermann, the mother of Keith, a broadcaster for Fox
Sports. Although some players discussed the bizarre nature of whom
the ball hit, Knoblauch said he was unaware the ball hit Keith
Olbermann's mother until reporters told him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was Father's Day, a difficult day for anyone who has lost
a father or who feels as if a father has been lost. Ray Knoblauch
coached Chuck during his amateur career, and Chuck credits his
father with helping him reach the majors. But Knoblauch has not
really been able to speak with his father during his two-year
throwing ordeal because Ray has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy,'' Knoblauch said. ``It's not just because
it's Father's Day. It doesn't change. That's never easy.''
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch made three errors in Thursday's game and he and
manager Joe Torre agreed that he should leave Yankee Stadium, the
first thing Knoblauch did was call his mother, Linda. Knoblauch,
who talks to his mother almost every day, said she told him she
wanted to travel to New York and hug him. Still, Knoblauch has been
unable to pry his mother from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked her to come, but she can't,'' Knoblauch said. ``She
doesn't want to leave him.''

ENERGY SECRETARY REJECTS CALLS TO RESIGN OVER LOS ALAMOS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The strange case of lost and found nuclear secrets
at Los Alamos National Laboratory took on a political edge Sunday,
as some Republican leaders in Congress called on Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson to resign after yet another security lapse at the
New Mexico laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Select Committee
on Intelligence, said Sunday that it was time for Richardson to
take responsibility for the security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should step down, he should be responsible,'' Shelby said
in an interview on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation.'' ``I
don't believe he's served his president well, and I don't believe
he's served his nation well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the intelligence panel, also
called for Richardson's resignation, while the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., complained that Richardson had ``not
been paying attention to this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson rejected the calls for his resignation, saying on the
ABC News program ``This Week'' Sunday that stepping down would be
``walking away'' from a problem that he had vowed to fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take responsibility to clean up this mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came at the end of a long week for Richardson, the
Energy Department and the Los Alamos laboratory. Officials at Los
Alamos announced on Monday that two computer hard drives containing
nuclear weapons data were missing, and that employees had waited
more than three weeks to report their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Richardson announced that the hard drives
had reappeared under equally mysterious circumstances. They were
discovered behind a copying machine in an area of the laboratory
that had been repeatedly searched by the FBI and the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives were used to store nuclear weapons data needed
by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, which responds to nuclear
accidents and nuclear-related threats. The drives contained design
information about nuclear weapons from China, France, Russia and
the United States, which could be used by the team to disarm
weapons
</P>
<P>
   The two drives were flown to Washington from Los Alamos after
they were found. They were being examined electronically to
determine if they had been tampered with or the data compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there's been no espionage,'' Richardson said on the
NBC program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding the hard drives came a year after
questions first came up over lax security at Los Alamos in the wake
of the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was a scientist at Los Alamos who was investigated in
connection with allegations that China had stolen nuclear data. He
was fired in March 1999 for security violations and was arrested in
December on charges of mishandling classified material after it was
discovered that he had downloaded and copied vast amounts of
nuclear weapons data from the classified computer network at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee was never charged with espionage, and the accusations
that China had stolen design information about America's most
advanced nuclear warhead have not been proven.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby and other Republican lawmakers said Sunday that
Richardson had repeatedly assured Congress that security at Los
Alamos had been improved in the wake of the Lee case. They also
noted that Richardson had opposed congressional plans to reorganize
the nuclear weapons laboratories and programs after last year's
espionage controversy. After Congress created an independent agency
to manage the laboratories, Richardson resisted the plan, arguing
that he should remain in charge, and that he could guarantee the
safety of the nation's nuclear secrets. Last week, in the wake of
the latest security breach, a new director of the new nuclear
weapons agency was confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Richardson's words promising to protect the nation's
secrets were thrown back at him by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose to assume the full responsibility, to reject putting
someone else in charge, to fight the creation of this new
semiautonomous agency,'' Kyl said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one, by his own choice, who chose to accept
(responsibility), and therefore he has to bear the consequences,
and I believe he ought to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, assailed the Clinton administration's for its
handling of security, telling an audience in Florida that
``America's national security should not be a matter of lost and
found.'' Bush added that the administration is to blame for
``confusion and chaos'' at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson stressed Sunday that he has been working over the
past year to tighten security, but suggested that his efforts have
been impeded by a nonchalant attitude about security among
scientists at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the human element,'' Richardson said. ``I'm
trying to change the security culture. I'm trying to deal with that
human element, and I'm doing my best. But to say that security has
not been upgraded at Los Alamos and at all our labs is wrong. We
have done a good job in upgrading security cybersecurity, physical
security, polygraphs, and I stand against anybody that rejects that
view.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, on the ABC program ``This Week,'' that ``I have to
keep a balance between science and security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is a priority, but at the same time a lot of
important scientific research has to take place, and you know,
right now I don't seem to win,'' he said. ``I'm attacked by
scientists that say `too much security,' members of Congress that
don't like polygraphs, civil libertarians that say I've gone too
far. And now you get _ now, I can take the heat. I just want to fix
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said investigators were focusing on members of the
Nuclear Emergency Search Team and scientists who had access to the
vault in the nuclear weapons design division of Los Alamos where
the hard drives were stored.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was possible that a scientist took the hard drives
and ``panicked'' when their disappearance led to an investigation.
The person may have then dropped them behind the copying machine in
order to return them without being caught.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which is now conducting a criminal inquiry, has given
polygraph tests to 26 people so far, focusing on scientists in the
laboratory's X Division and NEST members. At least three people
have flunked the tests, offering contradictory answers, officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richardson said on ``This Week'' that ``the FBI is focusing on a
few individuals within that X Division. We do believe there is no
evidence, according to the FBI and our experts, of espionage or
that they left the X Division. But at the same time, this is not a
victory speech. We have to get to the bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy energy secretary, T.J. Glauthier, appearing on Fox
News Sunday, said investigators ``can't tell for sure'' at this
time whether the hard drives had been copied or tampered with.

GORE'S `PROSPERITY' TOUR IS OFF TO A ROCKY START 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Zarek, a Pennsylvania Democratic campaign aide, was a
little crestfallen. ``Five graphs,'' she said as she mingled with
reporters on Wednesday at a medical center in Scranton, where Vice
President Al Gore was speaking. ``It took up the first five
graphs.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought out Zarek's gloom was the front-page report in The
Tribune, the Scranton daily, about Gore's appearance at an airport
rally there the night before. In a speech to 400 supporters, Gore
had introduced a Democrat running in a critical special legislative
election as John Wansacz.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the candidate's name was Jim. And The Tribune
devoted the first five paragraphs of its lead story to the goof.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of several dispiriting media moments for the vice
president last week, a week that his staff had been certain would
be a winner for him.
</P>
<P>
   With Gov. George W. Bush on hiatus at the family compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine, Gore took the opportunity to unveil his
``prosperity and progress tour,'' a multiweek drive to revive his
flagging campaign by reminding voters of what some strategists
believe has the potential to be a Gore trump card: the Clinton
administration's economic record.
</P>
<P>
   But the message never seemed to sink in. An announcement of the
tour at the New-York Historical Society in New York City proved to
be short on the details Gore had promised about what he would do
with the government's quickly growing surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The national news media were so unimpressed that ABC News did
not even feature the event on its nightly newscast, and while some
national dailies, including The New York Times, played it on the
bottom half of page 1 the next day, USA Today and The Los Angeles
Times put it inside.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the ho-hum play
was not a major concern; there would be ample time, he explained,
for readers and viewers to absorb the message of the prosperity
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, as Gore was planning to discuss some of the
policy details missing from the tour's kickoff, another day was
lost when Tony Coelho stepped down as campaign manager. That move,
which revived impressions of a campaign in frequent turmoil,
completely dominated the news coverage, leaving some Gore advisers
in a considerable state of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good thing,'' said one aide who asked for
anonymity. ``But how bad a thing will be determined by how
disciplined we stay. If we're able to get through the next 48
hours, then we have a whole new series of events to try to make
lemonade out of lemons.''
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up was the dominant political news story on the Sunday
morning talk shows. William M. Daley, the campaign's new chairman,
appeared on at least five of them to try to refute the suggestion
that Gore was in trouble. On the CBS News program ``Face the
Nation,'' Daley said the campaign dynamic would shift as the
pressure built on Bush to elaborate on his proposals. ``Then we
will begin to see the contrast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of events last week sometimes seemed out of any
handler's control. The Scranton visit, for example, had another
unexpected complication when Mercy Hospital, affiliated with the
Roman Catholic Church, at the last minute withdrew an invitation to
the vice president to speak, after Bishop James C. Timlin cited
Gore's support for abortion rights. ``No Mercy for Gore,'' said The
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The week also illustrated what is in the view of some Democrats
and Republicans Gore's surprisingly tough struggle to get out a
message that clicks with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say `smothered in the crib,''' Tom Hannon, the
political director of CNN, said of the Coelho story's deflating
effect just as the prosperity tour was getting started. ``But the
timing from their standpoint is not very felicitous. This is
clearly going to step on their rolling out of the new Al Gore
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is early in the campaign, polls show Bush's numbers
rising at the expense of Gore, a reflection in part of the Bush
campaign's seeming ability over the past several weeks to dominate
the news coverage with policy declarations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How perceptions are changed begins with the way the day-to-day
press covers the candidacy,'' said Greg Stevens, who was the media
consultant to Sen. John McCain, a presidential candidate known for
enjoying the give-and-take with reporters. ``The interesting thing
to me is that Gore in person is a pretty engaging person. But that
certainly does not come across at all in the exposure in the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's failure to establish a more winning presence in the news
media is, of course, a subjective matter. It has a chicken-or-egg
component: Is the press taking its cue from the polls in shaping
its depiction of him, or are the people answering pollsters'
queries based on conclusions drawn from newspapers and the nightly
news?
</P>
<P>
   To Lehane, a candidate's ups and downs are partly a function of
the predictable ebb and flow of a campaign and the desire of the
press corps to build up and tear down. ``I think there's a natural
cycle to all these campaigns,'' he said. He added that in the
current instance, the ``serious'' nature of the issues on which
Gore would be concentrating on the tour did not lend itself to
sensational coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But some political observers say that the problem goes deeper,
that Gore has never managed to shed his wooden image and that he
tries too hard to ingratiate himself. During his remarks at the
Allied Services medical center, where the campaign moved its event
after Mercy rescinded its invitation, Gore told the gathering:
``Tipper says hello. She enjoyed very much her trip to Scranton.
She came back really glowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the words ``prosperity and progress'' earn talk-show
snickers. ``Very hip,'' David Letterman wisecracked on Wednesday
night. ```Progress and prosperity': His campaign slogan is from the
'39 World's Fair.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators say Gore's tight handling of the news media
has helped create negative impressions. Gore often gives one-on-one
interviews with television anchors in local markets, and during his
daylong visit to Scranton he was ushered into a stuffy equipment
room at the medical center for a series of rapid-fire satellite
interviews with anchors in places like Evansville, Ind., and
Parkersburg, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters who travel with Gore regularly say they get to ask
him questions in a news-conference setting less than once a week.
In such a tightly controlled environment, people in the news
business say, it is not surprising that reporters grasp for any
development that does not follow the script _ and that blunders, no
matter how innocent, are magnified, as when a candidate gets a
local politician's first name wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Halperin, the political director for ABC News, suggested
that the fairly uninspiring initial response to the prosperity tour
by the national press grew out of a general mistrust of the
campaign's repeated attempts to reinvent Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president, unfortunately for him, is not cut much
slack,'' Halperin said. ``I think the Bush campaign has gotten some
traction in saying, `This is just Al Gore Version 6.0.' How many
more times can they let the guy say that this is the start of the
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say, however, that with an emphasis on prosperity,
Gore may have finally found a word he can repeat to his heart's
content, one that has enduring power beyond the media's ability to
discredit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the message that Gore has to be on,'' declared Paul
Begala, a former adviser to President Clinton and now a host of
``Equal Time'' on CNBC. ``I will say that when he focused on Elian
Gonzalez, I was very unhappy. Now he's got the right focus.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vice president's boosters think the issue plays so
well for him that even the most skeptical articles can work in his
favor. As Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, put it, ``Every single one of those process
stories will contain the words `peace,' `prosperity' and `Al
Gore.'''

LAKERS REFLECTION OF L.A.'S DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - The way Sam Perkins was talking Sunday, the Lakers
resonate the Los Angeles lifestyle better than any group since the
Beach Boys. ``The way the lifestyle is in L.A., they play the same
way,'' Perkins said. ``Their finesse, their showmanship, their
stars; they fit the mold.''
</P>
<P>
   What the former Laker surely knows but didn't dare say, for fear
of seeing it close-up today, is that there's another side to Los
Angeles. It is a side best reflected by Lakers reserve forward Rick
Fox, who, when he isn't shooting movies or squiring his actress
wife Vanessa Williams around, is providing sparks and scowls and
the occasional flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look within and find all the evil inside of
you,'' Fox said. He was talking about the drive to win an NBA
title, but, honestly, he could have been talking about the drive to
the Staples Center, site of tonight's NBA Finals Game 6 between the
Lakers and the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Any tourist who has taken the wheel of a rental car in L.A. and
survived to tell about it will say this: When Angelenos aren't
languidly speaking on their cell phones, sipping soy lattes,
sunbathing or stargazing, they're striking fear and loathing into
the hearts of the paltry few defensive drivers in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Stick an Angeleno in the fast lane of the southbound 101, give
him a hundred or so feet to make the 405 interchange (after all, no
sense creeping along in the slow lane any longer than is
necessary), and we guarantee you'll see such aggression it'll make
your testosterone boil.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal spinning off Rik Smits in the paint and then
elbowing him in the face to get off one of his baby hook shots is a
passive act next to the behavioral patterns of the typical Angeleno
during his or her daily commute.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Pacers' Reggie Miller perpetuate the Evian-drinking,
caffe latte-sipping Angeleno. We know that to live in L.A. is to
acquire over time, in addition to a tan and an agent, a mean streak
that is manifested in last milli-second lane changes, chronic
tailgating and failure to yield to anything that isn't flashing red
lights (and even then it's iffy).
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis might have the Speedway, but in L.A. every driver
is Mario Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   We have a well-tread saying in L.A.: You are how you drive. If
the Lakers make that their mantra tonight, we guarantee the Pacers
will be on the next plane home to their beloved Conseco Fieldhouse,
which, for the record, houses a Starbucks along with all those
nifty historical exhibits and is just a Miller 3-pointer away from
the Have a Nice Day cafe (we kid you not).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there would appear to be a lot of Hollywood, at least as
Miller perceives it, creeping into Hoosierville. As the owners of a
3-2 lead in the best-of-seven championship series, the Lakers'
mission tonight is to prove beyond a sliver of a doubt that the
fierce pride and provincialism of Hoosierville that Miller, a
former Bruin, perfectly personifies is alive and well in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did a laudable job of defending their turf in the
first two games. They raced to a 15-point lead after one quarter on
the way to a 17-point victory in Game 1 and rode O'Neal's back to a
seven-point win in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   If it appeared the Lakers played with a lot more aggression at
the Staples Center than at Conseco Fieldhouse, there's a reason.
The referees let them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more liberties given to a home-court team in
terms of being able to play physical,'' Fox said, and the numbers
bear him out. In Games 1 and 2, the Pacers accrued 61 fouls to the
Lakers' 45.
</P>
<P>
   That was partly Indiana's own conscious doing; in Game 2, the
Pacers' Hack-a-Shaq strategy put O'Neal on the line as many times
(39) as the whole Indiana team. For whatever reason, in the three
games in Indiana the referees' whistles went the other way, with
the Lakers collecting 91 fouls to the Pacers' 71.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Lakers must come out as mean as the L.A. driver who
refuses to make room for a merging car. They can't concede so much
as a foot, lest the Pacers take the series the distance.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes a flagrant foul on Jalen Rose by A.C. Green, a.k.a.
Mr. Serene, in the first minutes of play to set the tone, so be it.
Whatever they do (boxing out and rebounding would be nice), the
Lakers can't afford to stand around and look pretty like all the
other Angelenos inside the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' resident pretty boy needs no such reminders. From
Game 1 of the postseason, Fox alone seems to have grasped the
importance of every night bringing the same aggression he unleashes
on the lanes of L.A. roads to the basketball court's passing and
driving lanes.
</P>
<P>
   He might as well be wearing red for how often he has been, uh,
ticketed. Fox has collected five technical fouls in the postseason,
two more than he can recall receiving in his first six years in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear Fox has been a marked man since being ejected
late in the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the Western Conference
semifinals at Phoenix after drawing two technicals in 31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I get when I check into games now?'' Fox said,
shaking his head. ``(The referees say) None of that s--- tonight.
Behave yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets fouls and flagrant (fouls) for trying to block
shots,'' said reserve center John Salley, who had his own unique
take (doesn't he always?) on why that is so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me,'' Salley said, smiling, ``like the referees
are mad he married Vanessa Williams and are jealous as all
outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course. It's all in a day's title drive for L.A.'s team.

KIDS IN RAID ON CHURCH COMMUNITY HOLD REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAND POND, Vt. _ Sixteen years after a swarm of Vermont
troopers rousted 112 children from their beds in an effort to
examine them for signs of abuse, those same children, all grown up
now, returned Sunday to this tiny community to swear publicly they
had felt happy and loved, not abused.
</P>
<P>
   The event fell near the 16th anniversary of the 1984 raid here
on a religious group then known as the Northeast Kingdom Community
Church. The group has since changed its name to the Twelve Tribes
Community and has established itself in 25 locations around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the raid, the state of Vermont, frustrated in its
effort to verify reports that church members were beating their
children in the name of religion, sent 90 state troopers and 50
social workers in the early morning of June 22 to round up the
children _ who ranged in age from 9 days to 17 years old _ and put
them on a Greyhound bus bound for the courthouse in the nearby town
of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, about 80 of the children rode a Greyhound bus back to
Island Pond to tell their side of the story. To a standing ovation
from their friends and parents, they bounded off the bus and
gathered behind a lectern beside Island Pond, at the center of
town. Lisa Campbell, who was, at age 17, the oldest child involved
in the raid, was the first to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that several police officers gathered us into the
living room to ask us our names and dates of birth,'' Campbell
said. ``As evidence of the supposed child abuse, the police were
picking up knitting needles and pieces of wood used to prop the
windows open. I remember thinking that this was all ridiculous
because I knew the truth: there was no abuse in our household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am the mother of four, and only now can I realize what
our parents went through for us on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the atmosphere of the event was much more one of
celebration than of recrimination: the day was part Christmas, part
Independence Day and part First Amendment rally, all rolled into
one.
</P>
<P>
   The children, as they are still called, performed a circle dance
in honor of what they refer to as their ``Day of Deliverance'' by
Vermont District Judge Frank Mahady, who held 40 individual
hearings with families that day, then set the children free after
finding that the state lacked sufficient evidence to hold them.
</P>
<P>
   Church members did not dispute that. But they said they beat
children, usually with thin rods, in the spirit of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of speech and freedom of religion were both at risk,''
said Ed Wiseman, one of the founding members of the community.
``The issue of religious persecution and discrimination against new
religions is an issue all over the world today. We see a great need
for government leaders to make sure that the information they're
receiving about these new minority groups is reliable. Not doing
that was what created the atmosphere of moral panic in the state of
Vermont in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   The community was founded in the 1970s and set down roots in the
deep forests of Vermont, about 20 miles from the Canadian border.
Church members live in communal houses and work in communally run
businesses, like a shoe store, a candle shop and a dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   The group tries to follow the Bible closely and create a
``Kingdom of God.'' Wiseman and others said discipline was
essential to a sense of self-worth and that lack of it was
destroying the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Sage is a child of the raid and now a mother herself. Like
the other children celebrating Sunday, she is still a member of the
church. Sage said it was ``a God-given right'' to discipline
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have a hard time with discipline,'' she told the
gathering of 300 to 400 people, many of them community members who
had come from throughout the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``But discipline comes from love,'' she said ``Without
discipline, children will not have any respect for God or for
authority. They have no sense that there are consequences for
disobedience. Discipline is not a joyful experience, it hurts, but
I never felt unwanted or unloved.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont State Trooper Wayne Dyer, now retired, was a participant
in both the raid and Sunday's event. In a statement that he wrote
for the gathering, Dyer called the raid ``a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals who were responsible for the raid were not brought
to justice and the state got off the hook with a small lawsuit from
the family of a child who happened to be visiting that day and was
scooped up,'' Dyer wrote. ``Without the constitution, the Island
Pond church would have been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other social service and law enforcement officials were
invited, but did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Crane, the former defender general who represented the
parents in the case, made the trip from Boston for the occasion.
``I had to be here,'' said Crane, who now runs an athletic and
academic program for inner-city children. ``What I worried about
most was the impact of the raid on those kids, so it was a real
thrill to see them come running out of that bus.''

U.S. RELAXING RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By relaxing rules and applying only a spotty
enforcement of travel restrictions, the Clinton administration is
opening Cuba to American travelers at a rate not seen in more than
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials deny that the increased travel is
intended to undermine the 38-year-old embargo against Cuba, the new
flow has given rise to a flurry of business, personal and political
contacts. And there is a renewed push in some circles _ both
Democratic and Republican _ to relax the commercial boycott, one of
the last relics of the increasingly distant cold war.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans traveling legally to Cuba has surged by
10 percent a year for each of the last five years, Treasury
Department officials said. And the number traveling to Cuba on the
sly more than doubled in the same period, they said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cuban government figures, about 135,000 Americans
visited Cuba last year on individual or group trips sanctioned
under the administration's increasingly relaxed rules. And some
22,000 Americans went last year illegally through third countries,
according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   This increase in Americans going to Cuba reflects an
administration strategy to encourage contacts between civilians in
both lands, partly as a way to help Cuba prepare for a smooth
transition after President Fidel Castro, who has ruled since 1959,
is no longer in power.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has helped make those growing numbers
possible by allowing direct flights to Havana from New York and Los
Angeles this year, and adding more flights from Miami, which now
reach four cities in Cuba. The number of people traveling directly
to Cuba grew by almost 50 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Commerce Department increasingly approves
licenses for private planes, like those that carried executives in
January to the first trade show of American medical products in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   By making more contact with Americans, Cubans ``understand they
can make decisions in their own lives,'' said Charles S. Shapiro,
the director of the State Department's Office of Cuban Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the new strategy is a way to relax the embargo
while avoiding the political firestorm that would accompany a
formal attempt to do so, Shapiro said, ``Absolutely not.'' Congress
is needed for any substantial policy switch, he said. ``What the
president can do is make some changes in the margins.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress codified the Cuban embargo into law. That
stripped the president of the ability to lift sanctions by
executive order, as he has done, for example, with Vietnam. But the
president retains a right to define who can travel, and the
administration is considering additional measures to ease travel
further, including lifting the once-a-year restriction on visits by
Cuban Americans, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., returned from a recent trip to Cuba
and introduced a bill to let Americans travel freely to the island,
arguing that the trade ban is failing and the limits on travelers
are unconstitutional. ``Unilateral sanctions never work,'' he said.
``I thought we were supposedly shutting the place down, and you see
all this new hotel construction.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus
who went to Havana returned denouncing the embargo. The American
Farm Bureau threw its weight behind a Republican proposal to allow
the sale of food and medicine to Cuba after two Democrats from
Arkansas returned eager to sell rice. A top official of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce emerged from a meeting with Cuban officials
saying that Cuba is willing to negotiate compensation for
properties it confiscated from American companies more than four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ``people-to-people'' contacts were authorized with
bipartisan support in the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act but were not
broadly put into effect until last year. Access to Cuba, the top
Caribbean tourist destination a half century ago, has been limited
for decades to American journalists, government officials and Cuban
exiles visiting relatives. Now the flow includes the likes of the
Yale Glee Club, the Baltimore Orioles and 130 students from Buxton
High School in Williamstown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Huddleston, the top American diplomat in Cuba, said in a
town hall meeting in Los Angeles this month that the goal is to
channel information and ideas into Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``No island can remain an island with open communication,''
Huddleston said.
</P>
<P>
   But some supporters of the trade ban are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the benefits of the people-to-people policy,''
said Rep. Robert Menendez, a Cuban American Democrat from New
Jersey. ``There have been hundreds of thousands of visitors and
millions of dollars spent, and Castro has become more oppressive.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In May of last year, the administration for the first time gave
about 150 organizations, including universities _ from Harvard to
Berkeley _ high schools and religious groups, the authority to
license their own members for travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that formerly clashed with Treasury Department officials
over the travel restrictions say their fortunes have changed.
</P>
<P>
   When the San Francisco-based group Global Exchange staged a
protest trip by 200 Americans in 1994, Treasury Department
authorities confiscated passports and froze the group's bank
account. Today, Global Exchange is licensed to take Americans on
custom-designed tours to attend film festivals, conduct language
courses, even take an ecological bike trip, said Pam Montanaro, a
trip coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very friendly relationship with the Treasury,''
Montanaro said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Americans who do not bother to get government
approval face little risk of prosecution, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized travelers include everyone from Cuban Americans _
who run afoul of the rules by traveling more than the approved one
family visit a year _ to beachcombers, fishermen, political
activists, sex tourists and others.
</P>
<P>
   Though about 22,000 Americans traveled illegally to Cuba last
year, Treasury Department authorities levied only about 200 civil
penalties, officials said. And they did not refer a single case to
the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 cases of suspected travel violations have
languished for months because defense lawyers have demanded
hearings for their clients and the Treasury Department's Office of
Foreign Assets Control has no judges to conduct them. The office
hopes to borrow an administrative judge, part time, from the
Environmental Protection Agency this year, a senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The travel restrictions in reality are curbs on spending money
in Cuba. Authorized American travelers are allowed to spend up to
$183 a day. Unapproved visitors who spend cash could face up to 10
years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines, $250,000 in
individual fines or civil penalties of up to $55,000 per violation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities admit that their contradictory mandate _ to
make authorized travel easier while impeding tourism _ makes the
restrictions on Cuban travel some of the most difficult to enforce.
Yet they insist the current law remains an effective deterrent for
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to assume that if you go unlawfully, and are caught,
you can expect to be involved in this process'' of enforcement, the
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement scenario is complicated because many of the
unauthorized travelers fly to Cuba through third countries, like
the Bahamas, Canada or Mexico. Eager for the foreigners' cash, Cuba
obliges Americans by failing to stamp their passports.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves U.S. authorities to rely largely on the honor system
to determine which travelers have broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the increased legal travel is already building
bridges between Americans and Cubans. The American tide is
``keeping the Cuban government off balance,'' especially as it
seeks to attract investment but maintain control, said John
Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council in
New York, a nonprofit center financed by businesses that seek to
understand opportunities in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But those seeking to maintain the economic pressure on Cuba are
dismayed by growing signs that American tourism is becoming
mainstream. Urban bookstores offer a dozen guidebooks to Cuba;
rental villas in Cuba are offered on the Internet by an agency
based in Austin, Texas; the Web site of Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the
youth-oriented clothing company, offers tips on how to ``go play''
in Cuba, while noting that ``it's technically illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Menendez, the New Jersey lawmaker, said American visitors are
spending time on the beach and in nightclubs _ not engaging the
island's dissidents or independent journalists. He accused the
administration of ``casting an economic lifeline to the regime'' in
Havana to ease economic pressures there and avert a social
explosion, which in turn, could produce a refugee exodus.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yoel Judah walks slowly, talks fast. It is a
disarming combination, to watch the casual way he saunters into a
room, usually a son or two in tow, and to hear his words tripping
and tumbling over each other. It is not simply the speed or sound
of his voice, all low and lyrical, which sets him apart. It is the
likelihood that in any given situation, he will be the one talking.
</P>
<P>
   Judah ambled into Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn to work out with his
boxing star of a son, Zabdiel Judah. They were dressed alike,
stylish in designer T-shirts and billowing jeans. But it was not
difficult to tell who was father and who was son. Jumpy teens and
former fighters shook Zab's hand or slapped his back; they huddled
with Yoel. Zab was the newly crowned junior welterweight champion
of the International Boxing Federation, a 22-year-old who will
defend his title for the first time next week; his father was the
one with all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   As Zab busied himself with sparring, his father stood ringside,
arms draped over the ropes. Yoel never took his eyes off his son in
the ring, but he still managed to conduct three or four
simultaneous conversations with those gathered around him.
Occasionally, he barked encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, there you go,'' Yoel said. ``Back up! Go in! Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoel is a seventh-degree black belt and a former world champion
kick boxer, but more importantly, he is the undisputed ruler of
Team Judah, a stable of seven fighting sons who range in age from 8
to 24. They call him Abba, Hebrew for father. They, like many large
families, are insular _ you see the fun and wish you could join but
can not. Yet there is something eerie about this family of fighters
and its patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, I got an aura around me,'' Yoel says after the
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The aura's name is Order. Yoel Judah's life has always been
about order and violence, and scratching out an identity somewhere
within the two. Like the ying-yang philosophy he loves so well,
order and violence are his pendulum. The forces govern every aspect
of his life as well as the lives of his sons, whom he has raised
almost single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yoel, who is in his early 40s, once kept his distance as a
father and lost the custody of his children. He worked feverishly
to reclaim them, though, and has subsequently made them the center
of his world. He has full custody of all seven sons, although their
mother still sees them occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Yoel's is a world without question: he gives the rules, and the
boys follow. The family is coiled in discipline, and yet it seems
to thrive in the environment. The boys idolize their father. They
are polite, diligent, soft spoken and eager to please. None has
been lost to the prison system or the streets of Brooklyn. And none
expects anything less than to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Zab knocked out Jan Bergman (38-3) in the fourth round on Feb.
12 to claim the IBF junior welterweight title at Mohegan Sun Casino
in Uncasville, Conn. He will defend his title on June 24 against
Jason Rowland (21-1) in Glasgow, Scotland, on the Mike Tyson-Lou
Savarese undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Zab has 23 professional wins, 18 by knockout, and no losses, and
boxing writers have long called him ``Pernell Whitaker with
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Zab's manager of four years, Shelly Finkel, says the differences
between the two southpaws are almost too subtle to detect. ``I've
managed Pernell for 17 years,'' Finkel says, ``and the only
difference is that Zab's punch is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Within New York boxing circles, he was considered championship
material years ago. ``I don't get excited too much about any
fighter,'' says Joe Guzman, a boxing historian, ``but Zab Judah is
the best fighter out there, maybe with the exception of Roy Jones.
He is a kid who's going to make $50 million, and you see a fighter
like that once every 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet curiously, with all of Yoel's direction and all of Zab's
achievement, the younger Judah has already decided to bequeath none
of the fighting tradition onto the next generation. Why does the
son of a champion not want a champion for a son? His short answer:
``I would never try to put my child through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoel Judah gave his sons Biblical names: Ariel, Daniel, Zabdiel,
Joseph, Josiah, Michael, Yoel Jr. Zab's namesake is found in I
Chronicles 27 of the Old Testament, a soldier in charge of King
David's first army division of 24,000 men. The man's life is
encapsulated in one sentence about his occupation and his ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a leader of a army, and his father was Jashobeam,'' Zab
says. ``It's deep.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jewish genealogies, the story of the son always begins with
the father. It grounds him, explains him. And it is the same with
the Judah family. At the age of 13, Yoel embraced a century-old
hybrid of Christianity, Judaism and black nationalism, and today he
and his sons call themselves Israelites, or Black Jews. The
movement is informal and varied, and some branches of the
Israelites have even been accepted by reform Judaism. The Judahs do
not belong to a formal congregation. Instead, they huddle in their
East Flatbush home in the evenings or on weekends to hear Yoel tell
them about the men of God. King Solomon is a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godliness means you got laws that govern you, and the laws are
good,'' Yoel says. ``If you don't fear God and you don't have any
guidance, I'm going to have to watch you because you might do
anything. You're an outlaw. I got a lot of friends like that, and
now they're in the Crossbar Hotel. So God's laws are good, and I
understand them. They have guided me for 40 something years.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Yoel craved the guidance of his father, James Judah,
but James, a decorated Korean War veteran and club fighter,
instilled in his son little beyond a reverence for self-discipline
and an ability to fight. James divorced Yoel's mother, Viola, when
Yoel was 12, and after that he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   In need of a father figure, Yoel and his older brother, James,
found a group of retired fighters who hung out at the Police
Athletic League in Brownsville. They introduced the boys to karate,
and Yoel says he immediately fell in love with the structure and
science of the sport. Within the long workouts and the Zen mind
set, he found order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a really crazy martial artist,'' he says, ``doing
knuckle push-ups and 300 sit-ups and running from Brooklyn to
Queens and all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   He became a seventh degree black belt, a world champion kick
boxer with 11 title defenses while also dabbling as a professional
boxer, with a 5-0 record. He befriended neighborhood boxers like
Mark Breland and a young Mike Tyson. But even after he had children
of his own, Yoel was not aware that all the laurels came with a
price. His wake-up call came after he had been away at a fight
sometime in the early 1980s. At the time, he was living with the
mother of his children, Yamima, whom he never married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting then, and I went away to Florida to a fight,
and she was messing with the drugs here,'' he says, his voice
getting husky with emotion. ``She got messed up, and basically, she
left them for two days in the house. So the authorities came in and
snatched them. I come home, and my whole family is just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The children were placed in foster care, and for the next year
and a half, Yoel was only allowed to see them for an hour on
Fridays. He got jobs digging ditches and working on construction
sites and he never missed an appointment to see his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of those things, man, in my life where I could have
really flipped out, but I kept my composure,'' he says. ``The
judges later awarded me full custody, but at the time, the things I
had wasn't up to their standards. I had to have this and that, make
X amount a year, so I said, `OK, that's what I have to do? I'll do
it,' and it took me about a year to put it all together. I went
after it like a madman _ got me a good job, bigger crib, car, money
in the bank, prove myself clean, everything. And once I had them
back, yo, I wasn't ever going to lose them again. Had to hold
tight.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he still holds tight. Everyone who knows the Judahs
has heard about the worksheet, a rotating list of chores Yoel keeps
posted in the kitchen. Each evening after coming home from the gym,
the boys are expected to mop the floors, put out the garbage, do
the dishes and clean the basement. Zab is no exception, even though
he now has his own place in Rosedale, Queens. When he comes home
for dinner or a visit, which is almost daily, he has to pitch in.
Yoel says the chores keep Zab humble and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoel runs a tight house,'' says Yoel's brother, James, ``and
it's immaculate.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rules extend beyond housework. Michael, 16, says the ``don'ts''
are too many to recall: Don't break stuff. Don't do drugs. Don't go
to bed late. Don't forget your chores. Don't go anywhere without
telling Yoel. Don't hang out on the streets. (Punishments run
anywhere from being grounded for a month to doing 100 knuckle
push-ups on the concrete driveway.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he gets this look on his face, this mean look,''
Michael says with a laugh, ``and you know it's time to get
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fighting was one area Yoel always took seriously. Before and
after he retired from kick boxing in 1991, he had the children tag
along when he went to the gym. They lined up, ringside, and watched
his moves and learned to fear their father almost as much as they
loved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch him flip around dudes his size and then look at our
size, and we'd be like, `Hold up, if he can do them like that, what
could he do to us?'' Zab says. ``So pretty much, we never did too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the karate and boxing lessons keep his sons in a
protective gym most of the afternoon, Yoel hoped the training would
give them the confidence to walk away from fights. During the early
years, they lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant, so he knew they would be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know how to fight, you don't easily jump into a
fight,'' he says. ``Boxing will let you walk down a street at one
o'clock in the morning, not because you're cocky, but because
you're confident. At the same time, boxing gives you wisdom. You
won't be a fool.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   But an undercurrent of anger courses through a contact sport
like boxing. No matter how much you study the art and the grace of
boxing, its execution will inevitably end in pain. That is the
point: to leave the other guy in more pain than you. So as the boys
learned the mechanics of the fight, a few like Zab could not help
but try it out now and then. Zab even says he and his brother
Daniel were ``the fightingest brothers in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a troubled, bad kid,'' Zab says, ``but I had all
this energy. I was just bound to be a boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, were all the Judahs. Three of them have won the
New York City Golden Gloves, the well-known amateur tournament:
Ariel, once; Daniel, twice, and Zab, three times. Some, like
Michael, have also maintained their study of the martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   But Zab is the hope of his father, the world champion. That is
why Yoel doctored Zab's birth certificate when the 16-year-old was
too young to enter the Golden Gloves the first time around. Zab
thanked him by winning the tournament. Two years later, when Lou
Duva, who was then a manager with Main Events, invited Zab to spar
with Pernell ``Sweet Pea'' Whitaker, it was Yoel who told his son
to play it cool in front of the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' says Zab, ``but the whole time Dad was
saying, `Be careful of the hand that gives you gifts. Nobody gives
you nothing for nothing.' And he was right. It was good advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoel says Zab has ``grown into a very smart kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, I raised all my sons to think for themselves,''
he says. ``I told them, `I'll help you as much as I can, but you
got to make it happen because one day I'm not going to be around,
and I want you to survive and take care of yourself.' All my sons'
lives are better than mine because I made it that way.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Zab Judah has spent a short lifetime listening to his father,
absorbing his order. So when it is his turn to talk these days, he
speaks in the same low, rumbling way. He even tosses up like-minded
phrases about ``the awareness of self.'' It is clear that the
Judahs are a family too tightly laced for notions of real
independence. Yoel will not let go of Team Judah, and Zab will not
ask him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my guys, we're like a fortress,'' Yoel says. ``I love
them. They love me. Case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zab still depends on his father, especially where his rising
career is concerned. Zab is currently entertaining a $5 million
contract renewal from Main Events, as well as endorsement offers
from Magic Johnson, the Wayans brothers and Pepsi. He has
top-drawer representation in Finkel, his manager, and his earnings
have already topped $250,000. But Yoel still has final say on all
matters, which is why Zab waited six months to buy a $60,000 gold
Cadillac Escalade with some of his prize money. He wanted his
father's permission first.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me everything I know,'' Zab says. ``Why would I take
advice from my father my whole life, and then one day put someone
over him just because they're XYZ? I just wouldn't allow that to
happen. We're dealing with big figures now. We're dealing with big
players now, just big everything. He say, `Don't walk,' I am
standing still.''
</P>
<P>
   But under that loyal veneer, things are changing for Zab. He is
a man now, and he was raised to act like one, to think for himself.
And sometimes, especially lately, he thinks about not being a
boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his pearlized SUV after the workout, he quietly says
that he never would have pursued the sport had his father not been
a fighter. There is a lot of pride and a little resentment in his
voice when he talks about such things. Because now that he is
successful, Zab knows what kind of world and profession his father
has given him. He loves his father, but there is an unmistakable
strain. Zab is at the age when one wants to break free and forge
ahead, confident and capable and separate. But he cannot move far
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   As for boxing, he has never been seriously injured, he says, but
he does ache and bleed. He spends extra hours in the ring working
on defense because of friends like Stephan Johnson, a Brooklyn
fighter who died last fall from a boxing-related concussion. Zab
also knows plenty about the Don Kings of the boxing business, so he
buys books on financial planning and invests most of his earnings
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of bravado in him, of course. He still has
a few ideas about greater greatness, about becoming the undisputed
champion of the world and fighting two opponents on the same night.
He also wants to have a family of his own, and he wants to be a
good father. He wants to be a role model and a best friend, just
like his father is to him.
</P>
<P>
   But Zab's fathering will be different. In his family, when he is
the father, he says that boxing will not be encouraged. Zab's order
will have to come from somewhere else. His will not be the fighting
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' he says, his voice hovering above a whisper. ``From
me being in it and knowing the game and knowing what's behind it, I
would never try to put my child through that. I'm going to try to
make enough of a life for me, my kids and their kids.''

RECORDS FALL AS TIGER CRUISES TO U.S. OPEN VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Tiger Woods looked natural making
unforgettable shots, he looked natural making history, and it
seemed natural that Woods, the world's best player, won the 100th
U.S. Open on Sunday in record-setting fashion. Woods made a
dramatic statement that his phenomenal skills have never been in
more perfect harmony, the clearest signal yet that he intends to
dominate his sport during this generation.
</P>
<P>
   On a picture-perfect day at one of golf's most sacred locations,
Woods (12 under par, 272, 65-69-71-67) won the Open by a
record-setting 15 strokes over South Africa's Ernie Els and Miguel
Angel Jimenez of Spain, who tied for second place at three over
par. It was the largest victory margin ever in a major
championship, surpassing the 13-stroke victory margin by Old Tom
Morris at the 1862 British Open. The winning margin also broke a
record that had stood 101 years, surpassing the 11-stoke victory by
Willie Anderson in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also set the record for lowest score in relation to par
(12 strokes), breaking the previous record of eight under par set
by Ben Hogan in 1948, and equaled by Jack Nicklaus in 1980 and Lee
Janzen in 1993. And Woods' winning total of 272 tied the all-time
winning totals held by Nicklaus and Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has now won two majors by record-setting margins, his
12-stroke victory at the Masters in 1997, and Sunday's victory that
left a mind-boggling gap between him and a world-class field. When
Woods reached 12 under par by making a 10-foot birdie putt at the
par 5, 14th hole, he became only the second player to reach 12
under in Open history, tying Gil Morgan, who did it in 1992. But
unlike Morgan, who faded and lost the 1992 Open to Tom Watson,
Woods turned this event into an affirmation of his skills, leaving
people shaking their heads in awe.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Woods has already won three major championships _ the
Masters in 1997, the PGA Championship last year and Sunday's
victory at the Open. His ambition is to be remembered as the
greatest player of all-time. And Sunday, he completed one of golf's
all-time great performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Masters and the PGA Championship were special wins, but to
win our national championship, being an American, is a great
feeling,'' said Woods, who won three consecutive U.S. Amateur
championships (1994-96), and who has 23 victories worldwide since
turning professional in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe the thoughts that are going through your
mind. You grow up dreaming of beating all the best players, and
then you're walking down that fairway about to win,'' Woods said.
``It was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods won the Masters, it was a phenomenal performance by a
22-year-old who overpowered Augusta National Golf Club with his
length, while making putts from all over the greens. But this
victory was perhaps more impressive. The golf course was more
difficult. It required more accuracy off the tee, more course
management, and more patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Open has often been called golf's most demanding test, and
Woods passed it easily, like a class valedictorian. The outcome was
all but decided Saturday morning, when Woods took a record-breaking
six-stroke lead after two rounds. At that point, the rest of the
field needed strokes, and Woods was not giving any.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Woods first turned professional when
people wondered if he had the game to win an Open, whether he had
enough accuracy off the tee, or enough control with his short
irons, or enough patience. Those questions have been silenced.
Woods can win on any golf course that has tee boxes, fairways, and
greens.
</P>
<P>
   Only Nicklaus, who won three different majors by age 23, has won
three different majors quicker than Woods. And at next month's
British Open at St. Andrews, Scotland, the birthplace of golf,
Woods will attempt to complete the career Grand Slam, winning all
four majors faster than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday's final hole, a picturesque 543-yard par 5, the drama
centered on whether Woods would break the scoring record of 272.
After his tee shot and a lay-up approach, Woods hit his third on
the green, about 15 feet left of the hole, giving him a chance to
putt for birdie and a record 271.
</P>
<P>
   As Woods walked to the green, he removed his hat to acknowledge
the roaring gallery, and some fans dropped to their knees and bowed
repeatedly. Woods missed the putt for birdie at No. 18, but he made
the next putt for par, settling for a 272 total, one of the few
things Woods settled for during an amazing four-day performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those great weeks,'' said Woods, who won
for the fifth time this year, including his last two starts. ``I
made a lot of putts, big putts that I really needed that kept my
momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day at eight under par, Woods parred his way
through the front nine, then provided more memories on his
triumphant march to the Open trophy. At No. 10, Woods made a
12-foot putt for his first birdie of the day. That one putt seemed
to send a charge through Woods' body, just like it sent a charge
through the gallery. Two holes later, Woods made an 18-foot putt
for birdie, to reach 10 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Then at the par-4 No. 13, Woods hit another incredible shot, an
iron approach that nearly went in the hole, passing by the left
side of the cup and stopping less than 2 feet from the hole. Woods
tapped-in for another birdie that moved him to 11 under par.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, one could sense the momentum building. Woods made
another birdie at the par 5 No. 14, chipping to 8 feet on his third
shot, then making still another putt. At No. 16, Woods just missed
a 15-foot putt by less than a foot that would have moved him to 13
under par. Then at No. 17, Woods saved par with a superb bunker
shot that settled just a foot from the cup, another display of his
almost magical touch around the green. Then came the finish, with
Woods taking his well-deserved walk down the last fairway, soaking
in the adulation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week filled with emotion. The absence of Payne Stewart,
the defending champion who was killed in a plane crash last
October, was felt by the entire field, and Nicklaus, who missed the
cut, bid a tearful farewell to the gallery at No. 18 on Friday,
playing perhaps his final major.
</P>
<P>
   But the torch held by golf's most-dominant player has been
clearly passed from Nicklaus to Woods. And at the 100th Open,
everyone else was truly playing for second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest point?'' asked a puzzled Woods, when asked for his
highest and lowest points of the week. ``I never really had a low
point.''

   A site that had been selling college and pro football playbooks
has temporarily suspended operation after a backlash of criticism
it received in the media, including a story in Sports Illustrated
that questioned its motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have desired to be a resource for youth, junior high and
high school coaches,'' says the message on the home page for
SportsPlayBooks.com, based in Texas. ``Unfortunately, some concerns
have been raised concerning the material on our website. We have
never intended to undermine anyone or hurt anyone. We believed our
material could help coaches with their own teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Orders from an inventory of more than 100 playbooks going for
$23.95 were stopped after May 19 and the site will be up and
running again ``sometime this summer,'' it adds.
</P>
<P>
   -Houston Astros manager, former Taft High star and
self-proclaimed techhead Larry Dierker has been providing weekly
columns to MaxBaseball.com, a site that prides itself on free
original audio and video programming content.
</P>
<P>
   -The San Francisco Giants have pulled off launching a season
ticket exchange element to their Web site (www.sfgiants.com).
Season ticket holders who want to sell their seats can do so at
face value or more, and buyers who reply can then buy them with
credit cards. The team takes a 10-percent processing fee and
reissues the ticket to the buyer either by mail or at will call.
</P>
<P>
   -Major League Soccer is the first pro sport to combine forces
with SeasonTicket.com, a new site that not only provides unique
video highlights but allows users to taylor them to their own
desires.

CONSUMER ADVOCATE TAKES AIM AT CORPORATE-SPONSORED DEBATES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attempting to derail the fall's presidential
debates, Ralph Nader will file a complaint in Boston's US District
Court Monday, charging that the Federal Election Commission is
violating the law by allowing corporations to underwrite an
important aspect of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch, AT&AMP;T, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo, 3Comm, and other
businesses are helping pay for the fall debates, the first of which
will take place in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, since 1907, federal law has prohibited corporations
from contributing financially to candidates for Congress and
president. Even so, the FEC issued regulations making an exception
for corporations to fund the debates through the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a nonprofit corporation that has run the
candidate forums the last three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a Green Party presidential candidate, is asking the court
for an injunction to invalidate the FEC regulations, an injunction
he hopes will ultimately force the debate commission to return all
of its corporate contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't write that check for Bush directly and they
couldn't write that check for Gore directly, but they're allowed to
write a check to a collaborative Bush-Gore effort to advance their
own campaigns and to exclude competitors to advance their own
campaigns,'' Nader said in an interview. ``It's like a
double-header. They get tremendous media out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The first debate, between Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Governor George W. Bush, is scheduled to take place Oct. 3 at the
John F. Kennedy Library. Nader and other candidates for president,
such as Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, have been
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   A second debate is scheduled at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and a third will take place at Washington
University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The major party vice presidential candidates will square off at
Centre College in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Nader will be successful at derailing the debates
remains to be seen. A similar lawsuit was filed in New York by the
Libertarian Party. At the Commission on Presidential Debates,
executive director Janet H. Brown called the lawsuit ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been challenged every cycle and our position has
prevailed every cycle,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Nader say they will succeed where others have
failed because they are sticking to a narrow but clear point of
law. Also, they point out that when Ross Perot challenged the
debates in 1996, the US Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington said
the claim against the FEC regulations was not properly brought and
a decision on the merits would have to be left for another day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nader legal team also hopes to bolster its case by pointing
to a 1980 warning by the FEC to the League of Women Voters. Then,
the FEC said the League could not use corporate donations to put on
the presidential debates unless they included every candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Luke, a lawyer for Nader and the Green Party at the
National Voting Rights Institute in Cambridge, said the reason
corporate money should be excised from the debates is because it
gives corporations undue influence over the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kidding ourselves if we think industries that give all
this money to support major party candidates don't have a
disproportionate say in shaping the laws that affect us all,'' said
Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Scott P. Lewis, an attorney at Palmer and Dodge who is also
representing Nader, likened the debates to a ``Bud bowl,''
referring to a publicity campaign for Anheuser-Busch's top product,
Budweiser beer.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said the only thing corporate sponsors receive for
their donations is a few tickets to sit in the audience and watch
the debates as they take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``No donor who contributes to us has anything to do with the
debates themselves, the format, the decision on candidate
participation, or any other substantive issue,'' said Brown. She
also said the amount of the contributions is still being
negotiated, although the lawsuit puts the price tag in the millions
of dollars.

PATENTS: PATENT OFFICE PLAYS ROLE IN BUDGET BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Va.)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long considered a small, backwater agency, the Patent and
Trademark Office has found itself in recent years at the forefront
of the new, high-technology economy. Its leaders are happy with the
recognition but say that to hold this place and improve their
performance, they need one thing from the rest of the federal
government: to keep all the money the office earns.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter this month to Congress, the White House made the
case for dozens of programs it wants financed in this year's
appropriations bill, among them the patent office.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce,
Justice, State and the Judiciary proposed appropriating $905
million for the patent office, a raise that the subcommittee says
includes only an adjustment for inflation, and diverting any patent
office revenue above the new level to other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the patent office has responded that diverting
the money would deny his agency 25 percent of its self-projected
revenue, or $295 million, leading to hiring freezes and increased
delays in patent processing and approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Patent and Trademark Office believes it should be exempt
from such budget battles since it earns enough money to pay its
keep. Yet since 1992, Congress has appropriated some of those
earnings for unrelated agencies. And so the fight is on.
</P>
<P>
   It is taking place as the patent office fields criticism that it
has been slow and clumsy in adapting its policies, hiring practices
and training efforts to keep up with the high-technology economy.
The boom in software-related inventions, Internet business patents,
and human genome and biotechnology patents has often caught the
agency off guard and led to controversy, court cases and even
patent cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual property has emerged as the centerpiece of many
entrepreneurial ventures, since it is an asset suddenly necessary
to secure investors and financing. As a result, patent officials
say they have more work.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark registrations are up 40 percent this year, and patent
applications have increased 12 percent. Many business-method
inventions and other technology-related innovations are charting
new courses in patenting practices that may be challenged in
courts. So any hint that the quality of examinations may suffer
even as it starts taking longer to award patents gets attention.
</P>
<P>
   The flat budget proposal also comes just as the patent office is
finally gearing up to take its own plunge into the Internet. The
office announced this month that it would now accept credit-card
payments for the basic filing fee for patent applications, as well
as for patent maintenance fees, and fees for applications to
register or renew trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   And it has plans to allow inventors to file patent applications
electronically. Now the patent office's director says those
innovations may be threatened if the office cannot pay for them
with money it collects in user fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our revenues, projected to be $1.2 billion in fiscal
year 2001, are paid as fees by the knowledge-based high-tech
leaders and individual entrepreneurs who rely on us to help them
flourish in this economy,'' Q. Todd Dickinson wrote to the
subcommittee on intellectual property. ``We are no burden on the
American taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Appropriations Subcommittee have said that the
patent office has overestimated how much money it will earn in
2001, and how much work it will have next year. So the skimming of
the patent revenues that the subcommittee is proposing will be less
than 25 percent, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the subcommittee predicts that its appropriation would
divert only $167 million from the patent office. But even that
would be more than the $116 million diverted in 2000 _ and that
amount was a record.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the patent office is not considering raising user fees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The patent office is not alone in relying on user fees, or in
having Congress appropriate some of them. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, for example, also earns income from
customer fees, and some of those are also diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Patent fees are substantial. Applying for and maintaining a
patent can cost thousands of dollars, an amount that many inventors
think is too high. In 1999 the patent office issued 265,000 patents
and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson says the subcommittee's proposed appropriation is not
enough. He told Congress that such financing would lead to the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _ a freeze on hiring and overtime for current staff, which in
turn might encourage patent examiners, trademark lawyers and others
to leave the patent office
</P>
<P>
   _ imposition of restrictions on training for examiners and
administrators
</P>
<P>
   _ an increase in the time it takes the agency to take its first
action on each patent application from 11 months to 15, and on
trademark applications from 4.5 months to 8
</P>
<P>
   _ a situation in which 150,000 patents are rejected for an
initial examination, are not allowed or are not issued at all
</P>
<P>
   _ an increase in the time it takes to appeal agency decisions
</P>
<P>
   _ reduction or elimination of the planned electronic filing of
patent applications, online searching and upgrades of examiner
computer equipment
</P>
<P>
   _ risk to the financing of 87 patent and trademark libraries
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Others apparently agree. Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., chairman of
the subcommittee on courts and intellectual property, recently
introduced legislation that would allow the patent office to keep
all of its fees, and Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., introduced an amendment
to the appropriations bill that would restore the agency's funding
to the amount requested by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Office of Management and Budget has
recommended that President Clinton veto the bill if financing
appropriated by the appropriations subcommittee is less than the
administration's request. The White House also wants part of the
patent office's revenues, though not as much as Congress wants.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is a long way off. It may be months before the
appropriations bill winds its way through the House and Senate to
the president's desk, and it is unlikely to get there bearing the
same figures that were hammered out in last week's subcommittee
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But patent office officials and outside supporters like the
Intellectual Property Owners Association and the American
Intellectual Property Law Association know that budget
appropriations are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for fee payers is that their money is not
going to be used for the PTO,'' said Brigid Quinn, a public affairs
officer. ``But we will remain hopeful until the final stamp.''

northern China's coal capital where he came in search of better
wages, 35-year-old Jin Qian has seen cave-ins and fires and
explosions. He has heard the tell-tale creaking and run for his
life, and he has seen co-workers get obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   But far more routine, he and other miners say, are the physical
injuries that can leave a worker maimed for life. They speak of
broken arms and crushed fingers, of hands split by picks, of
battered ribs and collapsed lungs.
</P>
<P>
   This is the harshest face of coal mining in China _ a country
that produces more coal than any other in the world, and that, its
own alarmed officials admit, has probably the world's worst mine
safety record.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's produces one-fourth of the world's coal, but accounts
for four-fifths of the world's coal-industry fatalities,'' Wang
Shengshen, a mining engineer at the Chinese University of Mining,
said at a recent conference.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Baoming, head of the State Coal Industry Bureau, said in a
journal article this March that accidental deaths in China's coal
mines ``have wavered at around 10,000 a year.'' These are the
official numbers, which mining experts here say are an undercount
and do not begin to account for nonfatal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, whose agency is trying to combat the problem with
intensified mine inspections nationwide, cited international data
indicating that for every million tons of coal produced, China had
11 times as many reported fatalities as Russia, 15 times as many
fatalities as India and 182 times as many as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In China, most dangerous of all are the small, private mines
that in many regions surround giant, state-run mining companies, as
they do in Datong.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the thousands of privately run mines, each burrowing
into the thick seam of embalmed energy beneath these rolling
prairies, men wearing head lamps climb down crude shafts where they
use picks and crowbars to pry loose chunks of coal.
</P>
<P>
   With shovels and by hand, they heap the coal onto metal carts
that are jerked through long corridors to the open air. Finally, it
is loaded onto trucks for eventual sale throughout China and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   China, as its thickly polluted skies attest, makes intense use
of its vast coal reserves, burning it to fuel most electric plants
and factories and often even for home heating and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The large state mines, some of them virtual cities unto
themselves, usually give workers better job security, health care
and pensions, and their operations are more mechanized.
</P>
<P>
   In theory at least, these mines are watched over by the
state-run labor organization; while coal mining is dirty and
dangerous anywhere, they tend to take better precautions against
explosions, fires, cave-ins and other special hazards. However,
slumping prices in recent years have led to charges of scrimping on
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller mines are usually run by private entrepreneurs, who
sometimes have subcontracted facilities that were originally
developed by a local government. These operations, too, are
increasingly subjected to safety inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But because the labor is so arduous and risky and these mines
offer no long-term benefits, their front-line digging jobs are
shunned by all but the most desperate workers: underemployed
farmers from nearby counties or work-gangs contracted from distant
regions.
</P>
<P>
   One worker in a private mine, Wang Jing, said that more than
half the men in his nearby village are willing to risk the drudgery
and danger because they could not scratch a living out of the
semi-arid hills of Shanxi province, just below the Mongolian
desert.
</P>
<P>
   The miners work six or seven days a week in eight-hour shifts,
with no break for a meal. Each is paid according to how many carts
he fills, and the most dogged workers can make $120 in a good
month, miners said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to better inspections, the Chinese government has
begun to close down tens of thousands of the smallest and most
dangerous mines _ in part because of safety, but also because of
surplus production capacity and evidence that reckless tunneling on
the fringes may impair the long-term production of the state mines.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the closed-down mines, workers here said, have
secretly reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Resting on the large bed he shares with two fellow villagers,
weary after his 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. turn underground, a migrant
from Sichuan province reflected on his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mine is pretty safe,'' said the man, who gave his surname
as Zhao. For the last four years he has worked in a private mine
where 200 workers in two shifts produce about 500 tons of coal a
day. ``The owner knows that the mine must be safe if it is to keep
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, small accidents happen constantly,'' he said. ``Doing
such hard physical work at piece rates, it's unavoidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao, 36, has a wife who farms and a 12-year-old boy in school
back in Sichuan. Like most of his work crew, who are all from the
same county, he returns home once a year during the Chinese New
Year. Of his monthly wages of about $110, he said, he saves $60 to
send back home.
</P>
<P>
   The mining work, he said, is ``really tough.'' But back in his
home village, each family has only a fraction of an acre of
farmland, not enough to survive on. He hopes after several years to
return with savings ``to try something different, maybe animal
husbandry, growing pigs or chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries occur, Zhao said, most of the private mines in the
Datong area pay for medical care, but that workers who suffer
permanent disabilities have little choice but to move back home,
with no compensation for crushed opportunities. And the medical
care the owners pay for, he said with a laugh, is not always the
best around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're injured you get the cheaper medicines rather than
the better ones, and you have to get better sooner rather than
later,'' Zhou said. ``That's the way the market economy works.''

USC BASEBALL TEAM HAS `GREAT FUTURE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's baseball team had just been eliminated from
the College World Series, but amid the post-game disappointment,
there was also a realization: The Trojans were probably in Omaha a
year earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is upset to have to look at next year, but it's a
great future,'' pitcher Ronald Flores said. ``Our team is so
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering USC was ranked fourth in the nation at the end of
the year, it should be ranked at least that high going into next
season. The Trojans return their top four pitchers, six of eight
position players and their designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that this season's team, which didn't have anyone
drafted in the first five rounds, had a 16-game winning streak and
became only the third team in USC coach Mike Gillespie's 14 years
to reach the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would say we overachieved,'' Gillespie said.
``I certainly think this team achieved at the maximum level.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would confuse these scrappy Trojans with teams that won
conference titles in 1991 or 1996 but did not advance to the
College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly had teams that were outstanding teams and had a
legitimate chance to get here, and didn't for one reason or
another,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2000 edition won with good defense and pitching, and
those areas should be just as strong next season.
</P>
<P>
   USC expects to lose just two starters: senior third baseman
Justin Gemoll and sophomore catcher Beau Craig, who probably will
sign a contract with the Oakland A's after being drafted in the
sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing a lot of offense in Gemoll and Craig,'' Gillespie
said. ``We don't have a lot coming in. Perhaps a freshman will step
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the incoming freshmen are infielders Michael Moon of
Rancho Cucamonga and Jonathon Brewster of Notre Dame High in
Sherman Oaks along with left-handed pitcher Fraser Dizard of
Edmonds, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Moon will replace Gemoll at third, and first baseman Alberto
Concepcion will switch to catcher, meaning USC needs to find
someone to play first. The Trojans could also use a power-hitting
outfielder, something they lacked in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   There's always a chance a transfer will fill one of those roles.
In recent years, some of USC's best players (Gemoll, pitcher Mark
Prior, pitcher Barry Zito) have transferred over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, maybe something will happen out there,'' Gillespie
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The expected leaders will be shortstop Seth Davidson (.305),
second baseman Anthony Lunetta (.343, 12 homers, 50 RBI) and
Concepcion, who hit eight home runs in only 117 at-bats, which is
about half a season in college baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If USC's offense needs a boost, its pitching is deeper than
ever. The Trojans will have one of the best pitching staffs in the
nation, with all three starters returning (Rik Currier, Prior,
Anthony Reyes) along with their top reliever (Flores).
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff we have is pretty legit,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Currier went 15-3 this season as USC's ace, while Prior (10-7)
will be the most physically gifted player on the team and a certain
first-round draft choice. Reyes (6-6) threw a 95-mph fastball in
Omaha and probably had the most impressive World Series performance
of the three starters despite being a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was 6-2 as the team's mid-week starter and reliever. The
only thing lacking is a left-hander, and that's where Dizard should
find a role.
</P>
<P>
   Dizard was 7-2 with a 1.26 ERA while hitting .368 and was the
Gatorade state player of the year in Washington. He was selected in
the 21st round by the Baltimore Orioles but says he intends to come
to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Almost forgotten is 6-foot-6 sophomore Chad Clark, who was a
high school All-American but had control problems this season, and
sophomore Brian Bannister, the son of former major-leaguer Floyd
Bannister.

IN HEAT OF CAMPAIGN, A NEW REPORT STIRS OLD QUESTIONS FOR MRS.
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is an added starter on The New York Times front page)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigns around New York
in her Senate bid, voters almost never ask her about Whitewater,
the wide-ranging investigation into Arkansas land deals that an
independent counsel has been pursuing for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they raise questions about the firing of workers in the
White House travel office, her immense good fortune in the
commodities markets, or any other matter that has been
investigated. When a reporter makes a rare query along those lines,
Clinton successfully fends it off by saying that such things have
been ``investigated to death'' and that she believes people are
tired of them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton's campaign has been concerned enough to
poll voters on their views about the investigations, which are
nearing completion with her campaign in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, Robert Ray, the independent counsel who has
been investigating the Clintons, is expected to file a report with
a special judicial panel that will deal in part with whether the
first lady played any role in the firing of seven longtime
employees in the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   The report will not be made public, but people close to the
investigation say it is highly unlikely that it will recommend that
anyone be criminally prosecuted. Ray, who replaced Kenneth Starr as
the independent prosecutor last October, may announce that
conclusion publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The report itself, which will remain under seal for at least
three months, is expected to include a narrative that will touch on
whether Clinton was a force behind the decision to fire the
employees and whether she or any White House aides tried to conceal
her role.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political aides have said they believe that
scandal-weary voters no longer care about these issues. More to the
point, her supporters have argued that the scandals have been shown
to be without substance and that the Clintons have been targets of
a concerted effort by their political enemies to discredit them and
undo the results of two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no concern about these things,'' Clinton said in a
recent interview. ``I don't know how it will be used to be damaging
to me, if that's the idea behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of those issues, what Clinton has said about
them, what is publicly known and what questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL OFFICE FIRINGS
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, 1993, only a few months into the Clinton
administration, seven longtime employees of the White House travel
office, which handles arrangements for journalists accompanying the
president on trips, were dismissed and ordered off the White House
grounds. They were quickly replaced by friends and relatives of the
Clintons, most of them from Arkansas. White House officials said
that evidence of gross financial mismanagement had led to the
dismissals, allegations that were later found to be
unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   After several news reports suggested that the firings had been
improper, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, looked into the matter and sent Clinton a series of
questions about her role in it.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, the House Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight began its own investigation and sent Clinton additional
questions. About the same time, Attorney General Janet Reno
authorized Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, to look explicitly
into Clinton's actions in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The committee turned up what appeared to be a stark conflict
between Clinton's account of the shake-up and documents written by
David Watkins, the senior White House aide who carried out the
firings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton portrayed herself as a peripheral figure, someone who
had only casually asked to be kept informed. Watkins described a
climate of fear stoked by Clinton, who wanted the travel office
employees fired immediately. In a memo to Thomas F. McLarty III,
then the White House chief of staff, he wrote, ``We both knew there
would be hell to pay'' if ``we failed to take swift and decisive
action in conformity with the first lady's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a written chronology of events leading up to the firing,
Watkins quoted Clinton as saying, ``We need those people out and we
need our people in.'' He also wrote that he had spoken directly to
Clinton about his efforts to fire the employees. In addition, a
week before the dismissals, he said, he had been told by Harry
Thomason, an Arkansas friend of the Clintons and a Hollywood
producer, that Clinton told him she was ``ready to fire them that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In her response to the General Accounting Office, Clinton said
she had played no role in the decision to fire the employees,
though she might have expressed concern about the travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer told the GAO that ``Mrs. Clinton does not know the
origin of the decision to remove the travel office employees'' and
that ``she did not direct that any action be taken by anyone with
regard to the travel office other than expressing an interest in
receiving information about the review.''
</P>
<P>
   In her answers to the House committee, Clinton said she did not
remember telling Thomason on May 12 that she was ready to fire the
office employees that day. Although Watkins' documents portray
Clinton as intensely interested in the firings, she told the
committee investigators that she had been greatly preoccupied with
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to remember the specifics of conversations that
occurred almost three years ago,'' she told investigators, adding
that ``the spring of 1993 was a busy and stressful time.'' She said
she was busy adjusting to ``a change in living circumstances,
putting my daughter into a new school and increased entertainment
and media demands of the White House,'' as well as attending to her
father, who had suffered an ultimately fatal stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS DEALINGS
</P>
<P>
   Much of the investigation of Clinton's role in the range of
issues known collectively as Whitewater has centered on what she
did as a lawyer for various Arkansas clients, and allegations that
she tried to conceal or minimize her role.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, the independent counsel, is expected to file his report on
these matters with the special panel, made up of three judges,
sometime in the fall. It is uncertain whether its contents will be
available before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is how Clinton came to represent Madison Guaranty
Savings and Loan, a thrift institution that was operated by James
McDougal. McDougal and his wife, Susan, were partners of the
Clintons in the Whitewater real estate investment in the Ozarks.
Another issue is whether she sought to use her influence as the
governor's wife to seek special treatment from a state agency for
Madison, which was owned by her Whitewater partner.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the Whitewater controversy, Clinton said
that she became the billing partner at her law firm for Madison
Guaranty because Richard Massey, a young associate at the firm, had
asked for her help.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Massey brought in the account in 1985 because of
his association with a young man who worked for Madison. In April
1994, she told a nationally televised news conference:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very bright young associate in our office who had
a relationship with one of the officers at Madison, a young man
whom he had known,'' she said. ``Those two young men thought it
would be legal under Arkansas law for a savings and loan to issue
preferred stock, but there was absolutely no law on that, but they
couldn't be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that ``the young attorney'' came to her because she
knew McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, she added another detail in an interview
with the Resolution Trust Corp., the organization created to
liquidate the assets of failed savings and loans. She said that
James McDougal still owed the law firm money from a previous case
and that she became involved because she was the most likely person
to get him to pay the debt before the law firm would agree to
represent Madison.
</P>
<P>
   When Massey testified before Congress in January 1996, he
remembered events differently. He said that he was not responsible
for signing up Madison as a client and he did not recall any
conversation with Clinton in which he asked her to help him sign up
Madison and deal with McDougal's past debts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses have said that McDougal had settled his debts
with the law firm well before the time in 1985 that Clinton agreed
to work on the Madison account.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue was a task Clinton undertook for Madison six days
after Madison became a client. She telephoned Beverly Bassett, the
state securities commissioner in her husband's administration, to
discuss a proposal for Madison to float preferred stock. Clinton
told investigators for the RTC that she did not remember whom she
spoke to at the agency. She said she had only been trying to find
out who was the appropriate official for Massey to contact.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with National Public Radio on Jan. 13, 1996, she
said: ``Well, my memory about that is that I called the office. I
do not believe that I ever talked to the commissioner. And the
reason that I called is that we didn't know _ namely Mr. Massey and
the law firm _ who in the securities office was to handle this kind
of work because it was something new for Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the regulator, by then Beverly Bassett Schaffer, recalled
the conversation in detail when she testified before the Whitewater
committee. She said that Clinton, in fact, had spoken with her and
discussed the substance of the proposal to issue the stock. Massey,
for his part, testified that he had already known which person in
the state securities office to deal with on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Another lingering issue the final report is likely to address is
the batch of missing billing records discovered inexplicably in a
family room of the White House years after they were sought by
investigators. The billing records bear on two issues: how much
work Clinton did on the Madison account and her role in helping
with a troubled real estate transaction known as Castle Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The billing records showed that she put in about 60 hours of
work on the Madison account over a little more than a year. Her
lawyers have said that confirms her assertion that her contribution
was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   But the billing records show that most of her work came in a
short period, and that it was devoted to helping McDougal and Seth
Ward, a Little Rock businessman, develop a plot near Little Rock
known as Castle Grande. Clinton first said that she had never done
any work on Castle Grande, which was termed a sham transaction by
bank examiners.
</P>
<P>
   When the billing records showed that Clinton billed for more
than 30 hours of work on Castle Grande, she said that she had never
known the project by that name. She said that the development had
been known in her office only as the International Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, lawyers in the independent counsel's office
fiercely debated whether to charge Clinton with perjury. One senior
prosecutor even drafted a sample indictment, but that course was
ultimately rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel did end up successfully prosecuting
several other Arkansas figures, however, including Gov. Jim Guy
Tucker, who resigned from office.
</P>
<P>
   FBI FILES
</P>
<P>
   Allegations about Clinton's role in the improper acquisition by
the White House of some 900 confidential FBI files had two
components.
</P>
<P>
   First, an FBI agent said he had been told that Clinton was
behind the hiring of Craig Livingstone, the White House official
who was at the center of obtaining the files. Second, some
Republicans charged that the files had been acquired at Clinton's
behest to be used as a political intelligence-gathering tool. Many
of the files were of prominent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In March, however, Ray said that he had completed his
investigation and that the files had been acquired through a series
of errors committed by midlevel officials at the White House. And
he dismissed the notion that Clinton had been behind Livingstone's
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the FBI files matter, the independent counsel determined
that there was no substantial credible evidence that any senior
White House official, or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was
involved in seeking confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation
background reports of former White House staff from the
administrations of President Bush and President Reagan,'' Ray
reported.
</P>
<P>
   COMMODITIES TRADES
</P>
<P>
   One issue that was never investigated was Clinton's
extraordinary profits in trading in the commodities markets over
nine months in 1978 and 1979. Records show she turned an initial
investment of $1,000 into profits of nearly $100,000. She initially
said that she had placed all the trades herself and had made her
decisions by consulting a friend, James Blair, a poultry company
executive whose business was regulated by the state, and studying
the market in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   She later acknowledged that Blair had placed many of her trades
on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's good fortune in the commodities futures market has
been in the news in recent days, but the reason was that her
Republican opponent for the Senate, Rick Lazio, was the subject
newspaper reports about his own investments. The news accounts
reported Lazio, a Long Island congressman, had turned a $2,300
stock market investment in a company owned by his political
supporters into nearly $16,000 in a matter of weeks.

SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER TAKES PRAGMATIC APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe, June 18 _ As waves of political violence and
lawlessness wash across this country, the people here look south
for hope. There, at the foot of the continent, sits South Africa,
the beacon of democracy and the uncontested superpower of
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The former South African president, Nelson Mandela, cast his
moral mantle over the continent. His successor, Thabo Mbeki, seemed
to continue that policy, proclaiming the dawning of an ``African
renaissance'' in which leaders would no longer tolerate despots or
ignore the cries of the weak and oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Zimbabwe lurches toward next weekend's parliamentary
elections and growing numbers of opposition party supporters have
been beaten, killed and intimidated, South Africa remains
remarkably silent.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no condemnations of President Robert Mugabe, 76,
who is widely blamed for condoning or instigating the worst
political clashes here in more than a decade. Instead, Mbeki
praises Mugabe in public and prods him in private, treading
carefully with a significant trading partner and ally and ignoring
the howls of protest from human rights activists here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   One year after he inherited the reins of power from Mandela,
Mbeki is increasingly embracing a pragmatic foreign policy
seemingly driven more by national interest than humanitarian
principle.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he has pledged soldiers to keep the peace in
Congo, sent helicopters to rescue Mozambicans from floods and
traveled to the West as a champion of debt relief, foreign
investment and poverty reduction for his struggling continent.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, Mbeki declined to meet one-on-one with the
Dalai Lama, in part because some officials feared a meeting might
endanger South Africa's budding economic relations with China. And
this month, the Mbeki government drew sharp criticism from Amnesty
International, the human rights group, for considering arms sales
to the Chinese despite that country's spotty human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   And as South Africa's post-apartheid democracy flexes its
diplomatic muscles in a world that looks more and more toward
Africa for solutions to African problems, political analysts say
they expect to see more behind-the-scenes negotiating and less
tongue-lashing from the continent's biggest economic and military
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mandela really used his presidency as a bully pulpit,'' said
Chris Landsberg, a lecturer in international relations at the
University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg. ``Thabo will
articulate the importance of those same norms, democracy, good
governance, the rule of law. What he will not do is mention names.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't go to Washington and single out Mugabe publicly. And
in the future, I think we're going to see more instead of less of
this quiet diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy pursued by many powerful nations as they strive
to influence, rather than alienate, ideologically wayward, but
strategically important leaders and countries.
</P>
<P>
   And while opposition party leaders here have condemned Mbeki for
negotiating quietly with Mugabe as well as American, British, and
other European officials to resolve the crisis, Strobe Talbott,
deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, praised
Mbeki's handling of the situation during a visit to South Africa
last month.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials say they have little choice. Mugabe is
widely viewed as a proud and mercurial leader who responds poorly
to public criticism. They say they cannot afford to lose their
leverage with such an important neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is South Africa's largest regional trading partner,
although exports to Zimbabwe account for only about 3.5 percent of
its total trade. And Mugabe, a staunch supporter of the South
African anti-apartheid struggle, remains a key player in southern
Africa. Alienating him, officials say, could threaten regional
trade agreements and peace efforts in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   So in April, Mbeki told Mugabe privately to tone down the heated
rhetoric, end the violence, hold free and fair elections and obey
the rule of law, South African officials say. In return, Mbeki
promised to negotiate with the West to free up funds for land
redistribution and to argue Zimbabwe's case with officials from the
International Monetary Fund, which is withholding financial
support.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has had some success. Mugabe did agree to allow
international observers to monitor the parliamentary elections,
scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. And donors have agreed in
principle to finance land reform. But the violence has only become
worse, leaving opposition party members here feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, at least 26 people have been killed and 150
injured, most of them black supporters of the new opposition party,
the Movement for Democratic Change. But during a visit to Zimbabwe
last month, Mbeki made no mention of the attacks. Instead, he
praised Mugabe for his support in the era of South Africa's
struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to take this opportunity publicly to salute
President Mugabe, the rest of the leadership and the people of
Zimbabwe for what they did to ensure our liberation from apartheid
tyranny,'' Mbeki said in a speech at the opening of the Zimbabwe
Trade Show in Bulawayo, while members of the opposition shook their
heads in disbelief.

   ``South Africa provided moral leadership to the region under
President Nelson Mandela,'' said Welshman Ncube, the
secretary-general of the Movement for Democratic Change. ``We
looked to South Africa in admiration and hope. It is a grave
disservice to the people of Zimbabwe and the region that they align
themselves with despots.''
</P>
<P>
   South African officials acknowledge that Mugabe has not
responded as the Zimbabwean opposition had hoped. But they contend
there would have been no progress at all if he had publicly rebuked
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, on the other hand, has spoken out about Zimbabwe. But
even Mandela, who is celebrated as one of the world's pre-eminent
moral voices, had to juggle humanitarian principle and national
interest at times when he was president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for instance, Mandela decided to close South Africa's
embassy in Taiwan, a country that was considered supportive of the
liberation struggle, as a prelude to establishing full diplomatic
ties with China. And another longtime supporter with a poor human
rights record, President Fidel Castro of Cuba, kept Mandela's
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, Mbeki's government quietly allowed the
former Ethiopian dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, to receive
medical treatment in South Africa last year while human rights
activists angrily clamored for his extradition. Mengistu, another
champion of South Africa's liberation struggle, is wanted in
Ethiopia on charges that he committed genocide during his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the South African government acknowledge that there
is still much work to be done in Zimbabwe. But South Africa is
still feeling its way in foreign policy as it reaches beyond its
borders after decades of apartheid-era isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be wrong,'' said Mbeki, reflecting on his government's
Zimbabwe strategy, during an interview with foreign journalists
last month. ``I mean, somebody may say that perhaps we'd produce
results by shouting, denouncing. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm saying we've proceeded from the position that there
are problems there,'' he said ``But this is our neighbor. We have
to live with the Zimbabweans forever here. So let's end this
violence. But let's look for a cooperative approach.''

NOBORU TAKESHITA, 76, FORMER JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister, and one of
the legendary kingmakers of postwar politics in Japan, died Monday
in a Tokyo hospital after a long illness. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita (pronounced tah-kesh-tah), who was prime minister from
1987 to 1989, during the height of Japan's financial power, was
forced to resign from office by a stocks-for-favors scandal that
involved much of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But his influence over Japanese politics flourished, even in
resignation, as he used his control over the largest faction in the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pick a succession of prime
ministers and, it was widely believed, direct their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita's last hand-picked government was that of his longtime
protege, Keizo Obuchi, who became prime minister in July 1998. When
Obuchi suffered a debilitating stroke in April, his chief Cabinet
secretary, Mikio Aoiki, was widely reported to have spent four
hours at Takeshita's sickbed, plotting the prime minister's
succession.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi died in May and was replaced by Yoshiro Mori, a leader of
another Liberal Democratic Party faction. Mori's accession to
power, however, was made possible only through the approval of
Takeshita's former faction.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was said to have been deeply affected by Obuchi's
stroke, and he resigned the seat he had held in Japan's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Kakuei Tanaka, who had served as prime minister in
the 1970s, Takeshita was widely considered a principal architect of
the patronage-driven, machine-driven system of government that has
characterized Japanese politics since the country's rise to
economic power starting in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a system that de-emphasized policy matters and
concentrated instead on building the kind of consensus needed to
cobble together the complex coalitions needed to wield power within
the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's overwhelming policy priority in much of this period was
rapid economic growth, a concentration on gross national product,
leading the ruling party's ideology to be dubbed GNP-ism by some.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka, and later Takeshita, wielded their influence by
receiving a steady flow of visits from lawmakers eager to
redistribute some of Japan's new wealth to their districts, and
contractors eager to collect some of the budgetary windfall that
came from the country's ambitious development plans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tokyo and other large cities grew immensely during this
period, both men favored rural, underdeveloped areas of Japan. And
together with the government's huge subsidies for Japan's rice
farmers, their heavy spending in so-called rear-Japan _ the
country's western hinterlands _ ensured the loyalty of rural voters
as the bedrock of the Liberal Democratic Party's electoral base.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, however, would be brought down by scandals caused by
the close and scarcely regulated collusion between government and
business.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was forced from office after admitting that he
accepted illegal stock and cash donations from Recruit Co., a
publishing and telecommunications firm. The scandal involved large
payments from Recruit to leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Takeshita resisted the calls for his resignation,
even as three of his ministers were forced to leave office.
Finally, though, with some opinion polls showing as little as 3
percent support for his government, Takeshita agreed to step down.
He was never charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita had another brush with scandal in 1992, when it was
revealed that his allies had paid Japanese organized-crime groups
to put down a smear campaign that far-right groups were waging
against him. The payments were later confirmed by Shin Kanemaru,
another powerful Liberal Democratic Party politician and associate
of Takeshita, who acknowledged his role in a 1996 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although cited less often, Takeshita's influence over Japan's
economic direction was comparable in scope to his influence on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Where his predecessor as prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, had
failed to pass a highly unpopular consumption tax, Takeshita, in
his quiet, back-room way, quickly cobbled together the necessary
coalition and passed it.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest legacy, however, predated his term as prime
minister. As the powerful finance minister, in 1985, Takeshita
signed the Plaza Accord, in which the world's wealthy nations
agreed to push down the value of the dollar. After the agreement,
Japan's currency, the yen, soared. In response, the government
imposed a series of interest-rate cuts that quickly sent asset
prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing decade, known as the bubble years, stock and
real estate prices reached astronomical levels. At one point, the
land on which Japan's Imperial Palace is located was said to be
worth more than the entire state of California.
</P>
<P>
   Noboru Takeshita was born on February 26, 1924, in the farm
village of Kakeya in western Japan, the son of a sake brewer. He
served in the Japanese army during World War II as an instructor.
He was a graduate of the prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo,
and before turning to politics, he managed a high school judo team
and was an English teacher, though he would later acknowledge that
he did not speak the language very well.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected to office in 1951, winning a local assembly
seat in his native Shimane Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was first elected to Parliament in 1958 at age 34 and
rose in the ruling-party ranks under the tutelage of Tanaka, who
was prime minister from 1972 to 1974. He was chief Cabinet
secretary _ typically a launching pad for higher office _ for
another of Japan's most powerful postwar prime ministers, Eisaku
Sato, and again under Tanaka.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife Naoko, whom he had known since
childhood, and by three daughters and several grandchildren.

   Film: ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg''
</P>
<P>
   Credits: Produced, written and directed by Aviva Kempner
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 95 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Now showing: Laemmle Town Center in Encino, Village Twin in
Westlake Village and Landmark at Westside Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Why it's worth seeing: From the opening strains of a Yiddish
translation of ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame,'' Kempner's glowing
documentary examines how the Hall of Fame first baseman/outfielder
with the Detroit Tigers in the '30s and '40s was considered
baseball's version of Moses to Jewish Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While not deeply religious, Greenberg felt an obligation to his
heritage in a city with strong anti-Semetic leadership, riled by
the emergence of Hitler overseas. Only after Greenberg gave up four
years of his playing career to fight for the U.S. during World War
II did that societal bigotry somewhat change - ironically, as his
attitude about religion even soured more.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the narration is by Greenberg himself, taken from tapes
he recorded during the last months of his life (he died of cancer
at age 75 in 1986) in preparation of an autobiography released in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know: Jackie Robinson credits Greenberg with helping him
make the transition to the big leagues. In 1947, when Robinson
broke the color barrier, Greenberg was in his final season for the
Pittsburgh Pirates. While he would not allow his teammates to taunt
Robinson as other teams did, Greenberg confided with Robinson about
the similar razzing he had to endure, which Robinson later admitted
made Greenberg one of his heroes.

joined the Beverly Hills Tennis Club because he was a member.'' -

NEW ARCHBISHOP TAKES HELM IN NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With chants, scriptures and a moving tale of his own
to mark continuity and a new beginning, Edward Michael Egan took
the throne of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday and, in ancient
rites of magisterial splendor, was invested as the ninth archbishop
of New York, the nation's most visible Roman Catholic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks after his appointment by Pope John Paul II, the tall,
commanding 68-year-old churchman, a theological conservative and
canon lawyer who has been the bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., for 12
years, entered the packed cathedral in a choral procession of
ecclesiastical banners, honor guards and church officials.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a scene from Raphael or Titian: The cathedral
bathed in Florentine light, arches within arches, vaulted stone
pillars, soaring stained glass, the rapt faces of priests, nuns and
laity arrayed over the vast, gray drafty interior, and at the focus
a bishop radiant in white vestments.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling broadly, relaxed, obviously enjoying himself, he made
his way up the center aisle to the basso profundo of the cathedral
organ and the sustained applause of 2,700 people, including members
of his family, 800 friends from Bridgeport and hundreds more in
clerical garb and habits of religious orders.
</P>
<P>
   On the crowded altar, still in his bishop's red skullcap, he
presented his letter of appointment from the pope _ a document in
Latin on parchment _ to the archdiocesan officials. It was read
aloud by the Vatican's ambassador to the United States, Archbishop
Gabriel Montalvo, then stamped with the seal of the archdiocese and
handed to church officials for the archives.
</P>
<P>
   As thunderous applause swelled over the echoing cathedral,
Archbishop Egan donned a miter of office, was seated in the carved
wood throne of St. Patrick's and thus formally succeeded Cardinal
John J. O'Connor as head of the nation's most prominent Catholic
archdiocese, a 10-county realm of 2.4 million members, 413 parishes
and hundreds of schools, hospitals and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I humbly stand before each and every priest, deacon, religious
and member of the laity at this beautiful service to announce that
I come only to serve you, and all of the community in the three
boroughs and seven counties of the Archdiocese of New York,'' he
declared moments later in his first homily as archbishop. ``I come
with joy to serve to the best of my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled having served as vicar for education in the New York
archdiocese for three and a half years in the 1980s, and said he
had been ``continually captivated by the wonder and goodness'' of a
community of faith that educated its children, aided the sick and
needy, held tenaciously to church teachings and rejected ``all
forms of discrimination, mistreatment and cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop devoted most of his homily, however, to the story
of a young man he met one summer in New York _ a parable-like tale
of blood, compassion, riches and ultimately humility. At an
ordination ceremony with Mother Teresa in the poor neighborhood of
High Bridge in the Bronx, he said, a man suddenly staggered into
the church, bloody from a beating, shouting and sobbing for help.
Mother Teresa and other sisters, he said, took the man into a room
off the altar, calmed him, washed his wounds and found him a place
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the archbishop said, a young man who had been
in church approached him and asked to talk about what he had seen.
The man, Jon Bokron, told him: ``I'm making a pile of money in the
market, but I need to be part of what I witnessed in that
sacristy.'' The man eventually became a priest and was ordained by
Bishop Egan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I am coming to join,'' the archbishop said, ``a
community of faith whose compassion and sacrificial self-giving can
melt the heart of a young man making a fortune on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after becoming a priest, the man died of leukemia, and
Egan was at his bedside in his final days. ``I felt his loss
intensely,'' the archbishop said. He noted that the gold crucifix
on his chest, worn only on the most important occasions, had
belonged to Father Bokron, and was a reminder of him and of Christ.
``It is my inspiration, it is my strength,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Egan did not speak of policy matters or the direction his
administration of the archdiocese might take, he concluded his
homily with a message in Spanish, a gesture to Hispanic people who
make up one-third of the archdiocese. ``You can be sure that in the
coming years, I will do all that is possible to serve you as our
Father, God, has served,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's investiture _ known as a Ceremony of Canonical
Possession _ began two days of installation rites at the cathedral,
each followed by receptions around town to welcome the new
archbishop, who moved Sunday night into his official residence on
Madison Avenue behind the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ceremonies are to be more elaborate and celebratory: a
Mass of Installation with Egan presiding, a procession of 700
priests and an audience of 3,500, including eight cardinals and
hundreds of other church dignitaries, as well as scores of public
officials and other invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   Among those scheduled to attend are the four U.S. Senators from
New York and Connecticut, the New York Senate candidates Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick A. Lazio, Supreme Court Justices
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 90-minute ceremony was a more formal affair, a blend of
solemn ritual and canon law to invest authority in the new
archbishop, but it was full of pageantry and music, celebrated with
vespers, a service of evening prayers, choral psalms and scriptural
readings, unfolding as the day waned. There were prayers in
Ukrainian, Korean, Malayalam (a language of southwest India),
Tagalog, Arabic, Vietnamese, Spanish and Igbo (a Nigerian tongue).
</P>
<P>
   The skies were overcast and gray as the archbishop-elect arrived
on the cathedral's north terrace shortly before 4 p.m. Wearing a
white chasuble over a red alb, and a red skullcap, he was met by
Montalvo, the papal nuncio, and by Bishops Robert Brucato and
Patrick Sheridan, the apostolic administrator and the vicar general
of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that was largely scripted, the archbishop-elect,
surprising his security detail, turned aside on the steps to bless
4-month-old Amanda Brennan Hoffer, held by her father, John, while
her mother, Danielle, snapped pictures. The family, from
Hillsborough, N.J., beamed, and so did crowds on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral's great central doors then swung open and the
archbishop-elect entered, taking his place at the rear of a
procession of banners, student honor guards, archbishops and
bishops from across the country and dozens of priests and other
officials of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of the procession were members of an intercultural
council, under a banner proclaiming ``Unus Dominus Una Fides, Unum
Baptisma'' (One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism). Then came students
carrying banners representing the counties of the archdiocese:
Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam,
Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Dutchess.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral interior glowed softly under the high chandeliers
as Sheridan presented the archbishop-elect with a crucifix, which
he kissed. Msgr. Anthony Dalla Villa, the rector of St. Patrick's,
then handed him an aspergil, a Holy Water sprinkler, which he used
to bless the procession and the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   As the procession moved toward the sanctuary, votive candles
flickered in violet shadows on the edges of the nave and transept.
Organ music vibrated against the stone and marble, and a 100-voice
choir sang timeless hymns and haunting psalms in the late spring
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On the altar above the crypt where O'Connor was entombed after
his death on May 3 at age 80, the archbishop-elect sat on a
faldstool, used by a bishop in a church not (or in this case not
yet) his own. He handed his letter of appointment to Montalvo, who
read it aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as we mourn the sad passing of our venerable brother John
Joseph O'Connor, the late archbishop of New York, we naturally and
spontaneously choose you, venerable brother, whom we know to be an
experienced herald of the Gospel and administrator well-versed in
the affairs of the church, to fill the vacant See of New York and
to resume the interrupted governance of the Catholic community
there,'' the papal letter declared.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was then given to Msgr. Edward O'Donnell, the
chancellor of the archdiocese, who notarized it by affixing the
archdiocesan seal and turned it over to the Board of Consultors,
which empowers a bishop to exercise authority.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the pope's appointee became the ninth archbishop
(and 12th bishop) to lead the archdiocese. Egan then put on an
ivory miter and was escorted by Montalvo to the cathedra, the
throne of St. Patrick's, where he was seated and welcomed by the
assembled officials.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Egan's homily, especially the story of the young men inspired to
the priesthood, touched many in the crowd, including Msgr. Kevin
Sullivan, the chief operating officer of Catholic Charities in
Manhattan. ``I think that's just a tremendous vision to encourage
all of us New Yorkers to recognize, especially in a city that knows
a lot of power, a lot of wealth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Hernandez, a Mexican immigrant who lives in the Bronx
and attended the service with his wife, said he was impressed with
the archbishop's efforts to reach out to the Spanish-speaking
community. ``We're saddened by the death of Cardinal O'Connor, who
was very good to us,'' he said. ``But another chosen person is
here, and he'll represent us, he'll take care of us. He is making
us feel like we're part of the church and part of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Egan left the cathedral, shaking hands with old friends,
winking, beaming, stopping momentarily to thank well-wishers,
Evelyn Aquaro, a retired teacher, began to cry. ``The procession at
the end brought tears to my eyes,'' she said, ``because it brought
forth all my Catholic background and all the teachings. I was very
moved by the ceremony. I was impressed with the archbishop, his
manner, and I was really touched by the way he was able to speak in
other languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan is fluent in Latin, Italian and French and learned Spanish
in Bridgeport, home to many Hispanic Catholics. Much of his 43-year
career has been spent in upper echelons of the church, including 14
years in the Vatican, where he often worked with the pope, and 7
years as an aide to Cardinal John Cody in Chicago. In Bridgeport,
he was active in fund-raising, recruiting priests and reorganizing
schools and parishes. But critics said that he had been more of a
legal adversary than a pastor to parishioners who said they had
been sexually abused by priests.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Microsoft prepares to announce its Next
Generation Windows Services initiative this week, an influential
computer scientist is circulating a thesis that challenges Bill
Gates' vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. plans to describe its most
radically new computing strategy since December 1995, when Gates,
the Microsoft chairman, announced the ``embrace and extend''
strategy to expand the company's dominance of desktop computing to
include the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will now push to shift the locus of computing off the
desktop altogether _ and out into a ``cloud'' of large server
computers located on the Internet. But the goal is the same as the
one laid out five years ago: maintaining a central role for
Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, an influential critic is arguing that
Microsoft's new strategy may be a defensive plan that misjudges the
computer industry's future direction, that rather than moving to an
increasingly Web-centric model, computing is instead becoming
decentralized, with the key information distributed among millions
of desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as if Microsoft is scared and defensive,'' the
critic, David Gelernter, said in a telephone interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has based its reputation on refusing to lead and
always following, and once again they're behind the wave here,''
said Gelernter, a respected Yale University computer scientist.
``More and more people are coming to understand that the power of
desktop machines is enormous and is largely wasted when you spend
your time browsing on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter's argument is spelled out in ``The Second Coming _ a
Manifesto,'' an essay published last week in the German newspaper
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and posted on the Edge, a
technology forum on the Web (www.edge.org).
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter's critique has some influential supporters, including
Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who recently left Walt Disney's
Imagineering research group to form a new company, Applied Minds;
David Ditzel, a computer designer who is the founder of Transmeta
Inc., a Silicon Valley microprocessor company; and Rodney Brooks,
director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's criticisms of our current computing environments are
eloquently stated, and I think widely shared,'' Brooks wrote in a
recent comment posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's head of research, Rick Rashid, countered that
Gelernter was taking an academic, long-term view of computing that
might have little relevance for the current software market. ``It's
fairly predictable that David would be saying this,'' said Rashid,
a Microsoft senior vice president. ``This has been his mantra
throughout his career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Second Coming,'' a 10,000-word essay, contends that rather
than remaining a world that Microsoft or any company might
dominate, computing is actually shifting to a world in which data
and computer processing will be increasingly spread across
thousands, if not millions, of interconnected computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information travels through a sea of anonymous,
interchangeable computers like a breeze through tall grass,''
Gelernter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Rashid said Gelernter's criticism did not reflect the degree
to which data was already being distributed across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's already happening,'' Rashid said. ``There is already a
sea of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has pointed to Passport, a current e-commerce service
offered by the company, as the best example of what the Next
Generation Windows Services architecture will be like. Passport, a
program that verifies the identities of computer users when they
surf to a new site, is a clear example of the way data is now
flowing through the Internet between computers that are only
loosely coupled, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passport actually encompasses a huge amount of distributed
computing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gelernter's vision of a distributed computing
future is likely to be an accurate in the long term. He noted that
there had been a long tug-of-war between the ideas of centralized
and decentralized computing.
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter, who was seriously injured in 1993 by a mail bomb from
the so-called Unabomber, is a well-known computer scientist. His
credentials include his 1991 book ``Mirror Worlds,'' which forecast
the arrival of the World Wide Web and described a future in which
computing would make it possible to simulate virtually any aspect
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a software designer during the 1980s, Gelernter developed a
programming language known as Linda that was designed to spread
computations across hundreds of thousands of computers, harnessing
them into one distributed machine. Similar systems are now common
in the world of supercomputing.
</P>
<P>
   But distributed computing has been slow to arrive in the
mainstream computing world, and Gelernter places the blame for the
lack of innovation to a great extent on the absence of a new
computing vision from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Microsoft's Windows 98 and Windows 2000
software is derived from the Apple Macintosh and the Unix operating
systems, which he derides as fragile, decades-old technologies that
lock away much of the power of computing from nonexpert users.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the bulliest pulpit in the world,'' Gelernter said
of Microsoft, ``but what have they done with it?''

A COMPLETE FINANCIAL PICTURE ON ONE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK MCGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Banks and brokerage firms are racing to offer the newest new
thing in online financial services: a single place where customers
can find up-to-date information about all of their accounts at a
range of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, big financial firms saw this innovation,
known as account aggregation, as a threat to their customers'
privacy and financial security. But now, fearing an onslaught of
competition on the Internet, they are embracing it as a convenience
for customers and a powerful tool for building their own business.
Instead of warning against the service, banks are now telling their
customers to be wary of obtaining such services from anyone but
them.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank, hoping to get a head start on its
traditional competitors, is expected to announce Monday that it is
teaming up with a year-old Internet-based company called Yodlee.com
to introduce free account-aggregation services later this year for
Chase's 30 million online customers. Other major banks and
brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the PaineWebber
Group, are considering offering similar services through Yodlee or
one of about a dozen other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new services are expected to be free to consumers,
at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   These firms are reacting to the Internet-based businesses that
are offering account aggregation with the hope of serving as a
financial home page for consumers. Ameritrade Holdings, which
operates a popular online brokerage, has been offering account
aggregation at its Onmoney.com site on the Web, and earlier this
month, America Online announced an alliance with Yodlee to provide
a similar service for AOL's 22 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fewer than 300,000 people have registered for account
aggregation, which compiles a variety of information from different
sources, from savings and checking balances at a bank to the value
of stocks and bonds in brokerage accounts to the frequent-flier
miles customers have accumulated with airlines. But financial
industry executives predict that many more people will sign up for
the service as major firms demonstrate their acceptance of the
technology behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Using a process known as ``screen scraping,'' companies like
Yodlee gain electronic access, usually overnight, to their
customers' accounts at various financial institutions and download
them into a central file. In the morning, a user can log in and get
a current snapshot of her finances on one computer screen, or even
on the screen of a hand-held device like a Palm Pilot or a wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off for that convenience is that customers must
surrender the electronic passwords to all of their financial
accounts. That is an exchange that some privacy advocates warn
against. Even purveyors of the service acknowledge that most people
are uneasy about disclosing that information, especially to a
company they had never heard of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for someone to go to a start-up with an unusual
name like Yodlee and ask them to keep all of their personal
financial data,'' said Anil Arora, chief executive of Yodlee, based
in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``It's another thing to go to a company like
Chase that you already use as your primary financial company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Chase, said that in
a survey, about 45 percent of consumers said they would use an
account-aggregation service if it were provided by a financial
institution they trusted. ``We know that not everyone is going to
use this tomorrow, but we think customers want this service and the
time is right for us to take a leadership position in offering
it,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Account aggregation could prove very valuable to banks like
Chase. Financial institutions want a complete picture of their
customers' finances. They want to know what assets _ and debts _
their customers have elsewhere, both to protect themselves and to
create opportunities to sell more products, like credit cards,
loans and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   When its customers start using account aggregation, Chase will
get a peek at their outside holdings, like a brokerage account at
Merrill Lynch or use of an American Express card, and will be able
to use that information to create solicitations to them. Chase will
apply its own standards for privacy and security to the service,
even though it will be operated by Yodlee, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   If customers do not want to receive pitches for credit cards or
other products, he said, they can choose to be removed from mailing
and calling lists. ``You have the right at any point to say, `Do
not call me, do not make me an offer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial industry executives say that using account
aggregation as a tool for aggressive cross-selling could backfire.
``The firms that approach it that way are going to lose,'' said
Marten Hoekstra, director of marketing at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, financial firms should treat account aggregation as a
necessary convenience that all customers will soon demand and as a
critical offering to cement relationships with customers, he said.
Within a few years, brokerage firms will be using this innovation
to offer to advise customers on the management of all of their
assets, whether they are held in banks or at competing brokerages,
Hoekstra said.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber is negotiating with Yodlee and several of its
competitors, but it has not settled on a partner for the account
aggregation services it plans to offer because the technology has
not been perfected, Hoekstra said. ``It's a must-do as soon as it's
reliable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch already offers an early version of account
aggregation, for a monthly fee, to its wealthiest customers, those
with at least $5 million invested at the firm, through Greentrak, a
small, private company in New Rochelle, N.Y. The new management
team for Merrill's brokerage operation is considering whether to
offer a simpler form of account aggregation, through an
Internet-based service like Yodlee's, to all of its customers,
according to people at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's in the financial services area wants to try to
own the total financial relationship with clients,'' said Lon
Massingil, executive vice president of Greentrak. ``That's the race
that's going on now.''

PACERS' MILLER: TIME FOR A SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK   
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - The Pacers lost their first two games at the
Staples Center, and Reggie Miller was quiet as an Al Gore booster.
</P>
<P>
   He had his infamous 1-for-16 game in the opener. He came back
with 21 points in Game 2 but failed to score in the fourth quarter
of a game the Pacers could have stolen.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller came alive in Indiana, averaging 31 points a game and
shooting .545 from beyond the 3-point line, and the Pacers know
they need the deadly Miller if they are to make history.
</P>
<P>
   No team in the Finals has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can put on a better show than I did in the first
two games,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having shot the ball pretty well back home, I feel I'm in a
pretty good groove and a nice little rhythm, so it's definitely
time to be more aggressive on the offensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history indicates the Lakers should beware. He's made a
habit of being there when the Pacers needed him in these playoffs.
In each of Indiana's three previous closeout games, Miller was the
leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   He's averaged 33.3 points in their closeout games, including 41
in the one-point victory in Game 5 in the opening round against
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Bird, however, said the Pacers would be better
served not looking for Miller to carry the scoring load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the emphasis (tonight) is to continue to move the
basketball,'' Bird said. ``I don't care who gets the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get good ball movement, we're going to score a lot of
points. If we get stagnated, and try to post Reggie up and depend
on him getting too much, it's going to cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Road less traveled: The Staples Center might have a brief
history, but it hasn't been a pleasant one for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have lost all four games they played here this
season, including both games of the Finals, and regular-season
games against the Lakers and ... Clippers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clippers beat us there, the Lakers beat us there,'' Bird
said. ``Hell, anybody can beat is in there. Maybe we're due.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jalen Rose points out the Pacers have won at least one
road game in every other series to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can find a way to do that with Game 6, then
everybody tells us, in Game 7 anything can happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Points 'R' us: Both teams are scoring at an unusual clip in the
2000 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Spurs averaged 84.8 points per game in capturing
the title over the Knicks, who averaged 79.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Through five games in the Finals this year, the Pacers are
averaging 105.8 points and the Lakers 102.6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Defense typically tightens in the playoffs, as teams become
increasingly familiar with their opponents, but both teams are over
their season averages (Pacers, 101.3; Lakers 100.8).
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we can't get any better,'' Bird said. ``We're
shooting the ball extremely well, we're moving the basketball,
we're finding open guys, we're hitting a lot of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by the scores of the last two games. I like it,
but defense wins you championships. If we can hold them to 85-to-87
points, we have a good chance of beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   A dad remembered: Mark Jackson, who lost his dad this past
season, battled some mixed emotions Sunday on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet day,'' he said. ``I'm a dad, so it's a
great day for me. I look at the way God has blessed me with three
beautiful children. Also when I look at my Heavenly Father. It's
great to know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when I look at the father I was given on this Earth, a
great man who still lives in me and is missed daily. It's a great,
great day. I thank God for him, not just today on Father's Day, but
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   This and that: Enough of those road obstacles. The Pacers were
in a Santa Monica hotel during their first two games at the Staples
Center, but this time around are staying downtown. ... Guard Travis
Best (sprained right shoulder) claimed it is a game-time decision
whether he plays. He played only the first half of Game 5, before
the shoulder tightened. Said Best: ``It's very sore. I'd say it's
about the same.'' ... Rose went to the Staples Center on Saturday
to take in ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley's split-decision over Oscar De La
Hoya. Said Rose: ``I wondered what one of the judges was looking
at.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: The Pacers claim to be loose and say the Lakers are
still in control but can't help wondering how things will turn if
there is a Game 7. Said Bird: ``If we get to the next one, I think
they'll be a little shaky.''

GORE'S PLAN WILL OFFER VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS TO SOME
TAXPAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky.) (REWRITES first 2 grafs to raise attribution; ADDS more precise
figure in 8th graf) 
By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore plans in a speech on Tuesday
to propose a $200 billion program to help low- and middle-income
taxpayers build retirement accounts separate from what they will
receive from Social Security, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Gore aides, the program would work the way
401(k) savings plans work, but instead of employer contributions,
the federal government would make contributions in the form of tax
credits, providing in some cases up to a 3-to-1 match.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``retirement savings plus,'' the plan would offer tax
relief for couples with combined annual incomes of up to $100,000,
or individuals making up to $50,000. Gore's program would provide
the greatest benefit for couples with incomes of less than $30,000.
The program would cost the government $200 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary program, designed to compete with Gov. George W.
Bush's proposal for individuals to invest an unspecified portion of
their Social Security payroll tax in the stock market, would create
a fund for each participant that could expand by a maximum of
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple making up to $30,000 a year could contribute up
to $500 annually. They would then receive a refundable tax credit
of $1,500, bringing their account to $2,000. A couple making
$100,000 could contribute $1,500 to their account and earn a tax
credit of $500.
</P>
<P>
   Like IRAs and 401(k) plans, contributions to the accounts would
be tax deducible, accounts would grow tax-free and withdrawals
would be taxed. Private financial institutions would manage the
accounts. According to Gore aides, participation in the program
over 35 years of work would yield an individual about $200,000 for
retirement over and above Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does two things that Gore had earlier criticized in
the plan offered by his Republican rival. One, it allows people to
invest taxpayer money in the stock market. Two, it substantially
increases the amount of the federal budget surplus that Gore would
devote to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been fiercely critical of Bush for
devoting 1.3 trillion dollars of the surplus to an across-the-board
income tax cut over 10 years. But now, with this new savings plan,
Gore's total of targeted tax cuts clocks in at $500 billion over 10
years, twice what he had proposed before, and half of Bush's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, in interviews Sunday, said that the Gore plan is
a hedge against what they see as the risky alternative that Bush is
proposing. They said financial institutions would be limited to
offering investment options based on broad-based mutual funds for
equities, bonds and government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore intends to lay out the plan in a speech on Tuesday in
Lexington, Ky. The speech comes at the beginning of the second week
of his three-week ``progress and prosperity tour'' (sometimes
called the ``prosperity and progress tour'' by Gore) in which he is
traveling to key battleground states to try to get credit for the
nation's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement plan is a vivid example of how Gore is trying to
take advantage of the burgeoning federal budget surplus by spending
it on targeted groups of voters whom he needs to win over in
November _ in this case, low-income and middle-income working
families, the core Democratic base that polls have indicated are
slipping from Gore's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Gore's proposal revealed a weakening of his
stance against putting taxpayer money in the financial markets and
would thus contribute to an overall impression of Gore as someone
without reliable core values.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week the vice president will flip flop flip by coming out
for the use of tax money to be invested in the market to help
people retire,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's campaign spokesman.
``It's his third position in six months on the soundness of using
tax money to invest in markets to secure people's retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer pointed to the Clinton administration's now abandoned
position laid out in this year's budget proposal to allow
government-controlled investments in the markets, and then to a
Gore speech in May when he criticized Bush's plan to allow people
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing this to blunt Governor Bush's approach to allow
people to invest in the markets to help them retire with more
money,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer was talking about Gore's retirement plan, but he was
not the only one suggesting Sunday that Gore was perhaps going
through multiple reinventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new campaign chairman, William Daley, the commerce
secretary, made the rounds of the television talk shows Sunday and
was asked repeatedly about the vice president's continually
evolving personas.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Russert posed the question on the NBC program ``Meet The
Press'': ``Fairly or unfairly, there's a perception that Al Gore
has changed positions on abortion, on gun control, Elian Gonzalez,
wearing earth tones, wearing sports shirts, wearing coats and ties,
changing campaign chairmen, moving from Washington to Nashville,
suddenly in favor of a $500 billion tax cut _ that Gore has no
center, that he flips and panders as a politician. Is that a
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Daley replied, ``There's a problem because those are all
misconceptions that have been developed by either the opposition or
by media who aren't really following this day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The fact of the matter is, Al Gore has been
consistent about working for the average man and woman out there
and trying to address their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor has been tepid lately toward Gore, both for
his support for a bill to make normal trade relations permanent
with China and for naming Daley as his chairman to replace the
ailing Tony Coelho. Daley led the administration's fight on Capitol
Hill to pass the trade bill, which labor vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Sunday that he had talked with several labor leaders
over the last few days, including John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO, who met with Gore on Friday to complain about the Daley
appointment. Daley suggested his talks with labor leaders had been
fruitful and said he expected to meet with Sweeney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other Gore aides spent the day briefing reporters on the
retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   They said that while the chief goal of the plan would be to
provide a cushion for retirement nest eggs, participants could
withdraw their savings at any time without penalty for three
specific purposes: to cover catastrophic health expenses, to help
buy a first home, or to pay for a child's college education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan would encourage the rate of personal
savings, which has plunged to more than half the previous total
over the last decade. And they said that at a rate of return of 5.3
percent, an account for an individual could grow to $202,000 over
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that the program would be simplified by
having the Internal Revenue Service create a mechanism to deposit
people's tax credit and a share of their tax refunds directly into
the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' according to briefing paper prepared by the Gore
campaign, ``with a simple check-off on your tax return, workers
could see up to $2,000 each deposited in the `retirement savings
plus' each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan is based on the universal savings accounts
proposed in the 1999 State of the Union address by President
Clinton, a complex proposal that never made it through Congress.

FOX'S GOOD-GUY IMAGE NOW HAS AN EDGE TO IT 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charismatic, intelligent and blessed with a movie
star's good looks, Los Angeles Lakers forward Rick Fox thinks he is
made for Hollywood, even saying on occasion that he would be a star
on the silver screen if he was not playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But in watching Fox play against the Indiana Pacers, many
observers feel he is already acting out a character role in these
National Basketball Association finals. His looks, his marriage to
the singer and actress Vanessa Williams and his history of
nonconfrontation in the NBA are hard to reconcile with the way he
is suddenly pushing around and challenging the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to answer some of those kinds of questions: `Where is
this coming from? You were a model citizen and a complete angel for
10 years,''' Fox said Sunday at the Lakers' practice facility. ``In
a lot of cases, it's having enough respect to stand up for yourself
and your teammates. When challenged, if you don't put your foot
down, then guys are going to walk over your team. They are going to
have less respect for you, and in the past that has been the case
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sentiments are a sign of the tension that has built
between these clubs. Virtual strangers when this four-of-seven-game
series began, the Lakers and the Pacers are developing a sincere
dislike for one another. Fox got into an argument with Indiana's
Jalen Rose in Game 3, and exchanged heated words with Rose, Mark
Jackson and Reggie Miller in Game 5. And Jackson and Ron Harper had
a confrontation that resulted in a double-technical foul in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of bad blood,'' Lakers point guard Derek Fisher
said. ``It's not just about them; it's about this time of year.
This is now our sixth time playing this team in 12 days or so. That
is where the bad blood comes from. They get tired of getting pushed
around by Shaquille O'Neal just like we get tired of chasing their
3-point shooters around. It's not personal. It's just that we are
competing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of it may be personal. After Indiana's 120-87 victory
in Game 5, Miller said the Lakers were not the laid-back team that
many people associate with Los Angeles and the resurrection of
Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing all the pushing, the holding,'' he said. ``Then
they look at the refs like they're not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was almost certainly referring to what he perceived to be
dirty play by Fox. He elbowed Fox in the back while Fox was arguing
with Rose with 11 minutes remaining in Game 5. Fox, on the other
hand, believed the Pacers were getting too celebratory and cocky
near the end of their rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times in blowouts, teams take the liberty of
celebrating, enjoying themselves, having an air of bravado,'' Fox
said. ``That is something that I don't take too keenly to and I
don't think our team does either. If you let it continue, it
carries over to the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalen and I had a great exchange. It wasn't a pleasant
exchange but it was a competitive exchange. But Reggie wants to
sneak in his exchange. He doesn't want to square up with you. I
don't think that's very manly.''
</P>
<P>
   The verbal back-and-forth probably favors the Pacers, who like
having hostile feelings toward their opponents. It is well
documented that Miller feeds off controversy, and Fox realizes that
he may be playing into the hands of the deadliest shooter in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to have a charge,'' Fox said. ``He needs to be the
villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the extra motivation, Miller and the Pacers
returned to Los Angeles with confidence. They felt tremendous after
manhandling the Lakers in Game 5 and, after averaging 119 points
the last two games, they believed they could be the ones ahead in
the series, three games to two. The Pacers attributed their Game 1
loss to nervousness about appearing in their first NBA finals,
though they missed a prime opportunity to win Game 2 after Kobe
Bryant sprained his ankle, and said that Game 4, which the Lakers
won by 120-118 in overtime, could have gone either way.
</P>
<P>
   The aura of invincibility that the Lakers had the last time they
played host to Indiana at the Staples Center is gone. ``The Lakers
are not an impossible team to beat three times in a row, especially
with the firepower we have as a team,'' said Travis Best, who is
questionable for Monday's game with a bruised left shoulder. ``This
is a closer series than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, used to being viewed as superior all season, does
not like the arrogance and sense of entitlement that was spawned in
Indiana. The Lakers' plan is to return the Pacers to the cowering,
uncertain team they handled easily in Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have confidence because they have the chance to play
another game,'' Fisher said defensively, when asked about Indiana's
newfound brashness. ``But the fact is that we are still up, 3-2,
and now we play on our court. It's easy to feel confident at home
with your crowd. Let's see how much confidence they have tomorrow
night.''

ON TO ST. ANDREWS FOR `OPEN DOUBLE' 
</HEADLINE>
 (With GLF-U.S.-OPEN) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It's 6,000 miles from here to St.
Andrews, the auld gray toon in Scotland where golf grew up. But
when Tiger Woods strode off Pebble Beach as the U.S. Open champion,
it seemed as if he was already marching to the first tee at St.
Andrews, where the British Open and a career grand slam are
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   His opportunity for an ``Open double'' was all most people had
to look forward to Sunday as he shot a smooth 67 to dominate the
100th U.S. Open by a record 15 strokes with a record 12-under-par
272 total. After that dazzling performance, some observers are all
but conceding him the British Open, which begins July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tiger doesn't win at St. Andrews, there should be a
stewards' inquiry,'' said Sir Michael Bonallack, the recently
retired ruler of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which governs the
British Open. ``He can drive it over all the bunkers on his tee
shots, he has a great short game and he's a great putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonallack's opinion should be respected. Before he was the
world's most influential golf administrator, he was arguably
Britain's best amateur of the 20th century, a five-time British
Amateur champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how different the wind can be at St. Andrews,''
Woods said. ``On the first hole at the 1998 Dunhill Cup matches
there, I hit a 2-iron and a sand wedge one day, a driver and 4-iron
the next day. And there are bunkers there that you never see until
you're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In those 1998 Dunhill Cup matches, he shot 66, 70, 66, 72, a
total of 14 under par. But that was in November. In July, the
fairways there will be firmer, the greens harder.
</P>
<P>
   If the prevailing wind blows at St. Andrews, Woods will be
driving the green on three of the par-4 holes _ No. 9, No. 12 and
No. 18, which is in the shadow of both the R. and A.'s gray stone
clubhouse and the shop of Old Tom Morris, the legendary pro there.
If there is no wind, he will also drive the green on No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Old Tom Morris, incidentally, held the previous record for the
largest winning margin in a major championship, 13 strokes in the
1862 British Open at Prestwick.
</P>
<P>
   And if Woods wins the British Open, he will be the youngest
golfer to have completed the career grand slam. He's 24. Jack
Nicklaus was 26 when he completed his career slam with the 1966
British Open at Muirfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen are the only others to
have achieved the career grand slam by winning the Masters, the
U.S. Open, the British Open and the Professional Golfers
Association Championship. Woods won the Masters in 1997 and the PGA
last year at Medinah No. 3 outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods even to be within the British Open of a career grand
slam in his fourth full season on the pro tour testifies to his
dominance over the last 13 months with 13 tournament victories
(five this year) on the PGA Tour and in Europe, a remarkable
average of one a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been more dominating over this period,'' Nicklaus has
said, ``than I ever was over any similar period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is so much more than just the world's hottest golfer for a
few months, as David Duval was early last year, as so many others
have been over the years. If he doesn't win, he's almost always in
the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   For those awed by his distance off the tee, don't forget that of
today's pros he has the best short game. He's the best putter, the
best thinker, the best competitor. The tougher the tension, the
better he plays.
</P>
<P>
   He's never satisfied. Even with a big lead, when he hooked his
tee shot on the 18th in the second round onto the rocks of Carmel
Bay, he uttered expletives that were heard on television. He later
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   For all his length, he won this Open with the accuracy of his
tee shots into the fairway and his putting.
</P>
<P>
   He's the Microsoft of golf. If the other pros could find a judge
who would split him in two, they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is playing better than he ever has,'' his swing guru,
Butch Harmon, said before Tiger's par 71 for a 10-stroke lead on
Saturday. ``He's confident. He's mature. We've built his swing
together, so it's pretty easy to tweak if something goes wrong. If
he plays good golf, he's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods took charge of this Open during his opening-round 65,
which featured five par-saving putts, each at a missable distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those 8-foot or 10-foot par-saving putts,'' Wood said,
``making them makes you feel better than you do when you make a
birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   But that virtually perfect putting stroke wasn't an accident.
Early in the week, he wasn't satisfied with his putting stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I got here,'' he said after the first round, ``my stroke
hasn't been as comfortable as I'd like to have it. I was making
putts, but there are certain ways of making putts. Either they go
in properly or you just kind of scoot them in. I didn't like the
way I was rolling the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making quite a few putts in the practice rounds, but the
ball wasn't turning over the way I like to see it roll. I found
that my posture was a little off, my release wasn't quite right. I
just needed to get some reps in. Once I get enough reps, I feel a
little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the ball turning over the way he likes to see it roll;
that's how fine a distinction Tiger Woods makes in analyzing his
putting stroke. Just another reason why he's now going to St.
Andrews for the career grand slam. &QL;

M'S STAY HOT IN 10-2 WIN OVER TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Gil Meche can't pitch much better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Who could? Meche had allowed no runs in his past two starts,
including Sunday's six innings of three-hit ball in a 10-2 win over
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't break Meche's heart any, though, if he could go
deeper into the game. It's part of innate greed of competition _ if
you throw six shutout innings, you want to throw seven.
</P>
<P>
   Six innings is about Meche's limit these days, however. Despite
going 2-0 in his first two starts off the disabled list, Meche
continues to have problems with a ``dead arm.'' He came out of the
game Sunday in the Metrodome despite the fact that the Twins
couldn't hit him with a tennis racket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about what I did,'' Meche said. ``Six innings, no
runs? No matter how my arm felt, I'd take that any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggravating to go six innings, throw only 80 pitches and
know you should be good for one or two more innings,'' Meche said.
``But I just can't seem to go past there.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella said the Mariners are ready to take a new
approach with Meche. There is talk of changing his diet. Of
changing his running program. Of having him stretch his arm between
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried hasn't worked,'' Piniella said. ``We're
trying to figure out how to get this resolved. The disabled list
isn't the answer. If nothing else, maybe we'll try some good snake
oil.''
</P>
<P>
   With Meche winning twice, the Mariners went 7-3 on this June
road trip. In the first two months of the season, the Mariners
didn't have a winning road trip and went 10-16 overall away from
Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   And Meche's discomfort wasn't going to stand in the way of the
Mariners enjoying the results of this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this team would play better on the road,'' DH Edgar
Martinez said. Martinez drew four walks. The one time the Twins
tried to pitch to him, Martinez launched a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, 3-4-5 hitters Alex Rodriguez, Martinez and John
Olerud were a combined 9-for-11 with a couple of homers and eight
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   For Rodriguez and Martinez, those top-notch performances have
come to be regarded as commonplace. But for Olerud, who had slumped
badly of late, this four days in the Twin Cities has resuscitated
his batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud had been stuck in a quagmire of murky offense, so much so
that he'd been dropped from fourth to fifth in the batting order
against right-handed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Metrodome, Olerud found himself at a pharmacy that
had the goods to cure many of his ills. Under the influence of
Minnesota pitching, Olerud had four hits Sunday and nine for the
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Most encouraging for the Mariners was the quality of those hits.
After not hitting a homer since April 26, Olerud went deep twice in
four games, both to center field. And of his other seven hits, four
were doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I had a good day, so the 3-4-5 guys were good today,''
said Olerud. ``I haven't been swinging as well as I'd like. I've
been missing pitches I should be able to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this was a real good series for me. I want to see it carry
over to the next series, though.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the road trip as a whole, the Mariners can once again lay
claim to being road warriors.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of this 10-game trip, the Mariners won seven times.
Before the trip started, the Mariners had just 10 road wins in 26
games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trip started, Piniella held a meeting in the new
Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco. Part of the reason for the
meeting was to get familiar with the park. Part of it was for
Piniella to make a statement _ the 10-16 record on the road wasn't
acceptable. It was time to play good baseball on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Message received.
</P>
<P>
   As such things go, the trip was a complete success, with both
the pitching and hitting holding up. The hitters averaged .318
(110-for-346), while the pitchers compiled an earned run average of
3.87 (36 earned runs in 832/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we'd be better than what we've been playing,''
Rodriguez said. ``We got good pitching, we got good hitting and we
always play good defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begins here.''

FIRST LADY ATTACKS LAZIO FOR MISSING VOTE IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton intensified her criticism of
Rick Lazio over the weekend, chastising the Long Island congressman
for missing a vote on a plan to establish an oil reserve in the New
York harbor area that could be tapped to limit surges in
heating-oil prices in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had helped champion the legislation, which went to a vote
on Thursday night, and once he even cited the plight of a
93-year-old woman who could not afford to pay her heating bills.
But he flew home to Long Island on Thursday evening to prepare for
an upstate campaign swing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After he left, the House voted at 8:24 p.m. to reject the
measure, 193-195.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at the Albany County Democratic Party picnic
in Altamont on Saturday, called Lazio's absence ``a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of vote that could literally save New Yorkers
millions and millions of dollars,'' she said. ``If he had been
there, it might have made all the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, said Sunday that the congressman
regretted having to miss the roll call, but ``the bottom line is
his vote would not have changed the outcome.'' McLagan said that
Lazio was present for 99 percent of the votes in the House in 1999,
but that he would have difficulty sustaining that record while
running in a statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 47 House members who missed the oil-reserve vote were
five New York City Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   All week, Clinton had increased her criticism of Lazio, the
Republican who stepped in last month to replace Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and who is almost even with her in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday she released television advertisements attacking
Lazio's opposition to hate-crime and health-care legislation that
she supports. Lazio responded by issuing a paper titled ``Desperate
Clinton Campaign Goes Negative,'' saying that Clinton had distorted
his stands on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The vote that Lazio missed was on an amendment to a House budget
bill that would have set aside $10 million to create an oil reserve
of 2 million barrels. It would be available if, as happened last
winter, prices surge because the fuel-oil supply drops, or if a
winter is extremely cold. The House had earlier authorized the
reserve but had not set aside money to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-Brooklyn, who voted for the oil reserve,
said Sunday that he understood the difficulty of running for the
Senate while serving in Congress, and he noted that the House
leaders had indicated that they intended to finish the day's
business by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiner said he was still frustrated by Lazio's absence, in
part because his influence as the Republican Senate nominee could
have changed the votes of some of the 181 Republicans who voted
against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   McLagan said it was ``ridiculous to hold Congressman Lazio
responsible for the votes of others.'' He added that Lazio hoped to
revive the matter in a House-Senate conference committee.
Responding to the criticism of Lazio for being absent on the vote,
McLagan said sarcastically that at least he has a voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton has never voted or done a single thing for New
Yorkers,'' McLagan said.

<P>
   Just last week it announced deals with SympathyFlowers.com;
Classicmemorials.com; Mooney &AMP; Co., a provider of sympathy and
cremation cards; and the Funeral Fine Art Collection, which
according to the news release offers ``high-end urns.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals enable the partners to sell their wares on
HeavenlyDoor.com's site, in exchange for up to 40 percent of the
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed in November and went public in January,
and so far it has mainly offered a free online service linking
people who want to plan funerals _ in many cases, years before
anyone actually dies _ with one of the 100 funeral homes it has
signed up as members.
</P>
<P>
   But as last week's deals indicate, the company is expanding into
transactions. Helen Maynard, HeavenlyDoor's senior vice president,
said the company was discussing similar arrangements with insurance
companies, airlines and hotels. Starting in September, the company
plans to offer Heavenly Store, an online supermarket of
funeral-related services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious jewelry, ash-scattering services _ there are just so
many facets of the funeral industry that people don't automatically
think of on their own,'' Maynard said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a business-to-business play in the works, too. By
autumn, HeavenlyDoor hopes to have an electronic marketplace up and
running that will hook funeral homes up with makers of caskets and
embalming fluids and with other vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said HeavenlyDoor.com planned to negotiate discount
contracts for its funeral-director members and hoped to make money
in transaction fees.

   Web Site Challenges Chat-Room Status Quo
</P>
<P>
   Few marketing gimmicks challenge the status quo as much as
im-ur.com, the brainchild of Jonathan Shem-Ur, an Israeli former
journalist turned Web entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist on the traditional chat room, Shem-Ur is producing a
site with 4,000 discussion areas, sections where anybody can post
opinions, offer advice and engage in debate on assorted subjects.
Every day the comments posted in each area are displayed in the
format of a newspaper's editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   The more an opinion is read, the more prominently the opinion is
displayed in the daily forum.
</P>
<P>
   The site also takes an unusual approach to advertising:
Participants will see ads only if they want to, rather than being
barraged with banner ads on every page. To view an ad, the reader
clicks on a ``relevant ads'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   The site officially started last week, but without advertising
at first. The company said it wanted to build its audience before
trying to sell ads. Shem-Ur says he wants to turn the Web into a
great town square, much like an ancient Greek agora, where people
can air their opinions freely. He said the standard Internet chat
room, plastered with banner ads, was too chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   For a celebrity spokesman, Shem-Ur has hired Judge Joseph
Wapner, formerly of television's ``The People's Court,'' who is now
wielding the gavel on ``Judge Wapner's Animal Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could always have your say in my court,'' Wapner said in a
statement released by the company. ``And that's what im-ur.com is
all about _ having your say.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Will advertisers agree to have their say the
im-ur way?

AFTER ATTACK BY HACKERS, AOL TIGHTENS DATA ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online said Sunday that it would take steps to fix flaws
in its network that allowed hackers to get access to personal
information about some members last week.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D'Amato, a spokesman for America Online, said the
company did not yet know the specific number of member accounts
that were affected and what damage was done, but he added that the
company believed the number was about 200. The service has about 23
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to light late last week when Observers.net, a Web
site critical of AOL, said hackers had found an elaborate way to
gain access to the system used by America Online's customer service
representatives. Depending on their job function, those
representatives can see members' names, addresses and other
information, like the last time they logged on. A smaller number of
representatives has access to the users' full credit-card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said the company did not believe that any credit-card
numbers were obtained in the incident last week.
</P>
<P>
   The breach involved sending an electronic mail message _ with an
attached program file _ to a customer service representative or
other America Online employee who has access to customer
information. E-mail attachments were used in the recent worldwide
outbreak of the ``I Love You'' bug and are potentially very
destructive because if the recipient opens an attached program, the
bug can allow access to the user's entire system.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, D'Amato said, the virus did two things. First, it
identified an AOL employee's password and sent it back to the
e-mail's sender. And second, it created an electronic link between
the AOL internal network and the hacker. Using what amounted to a
covert relay station, the hacker could use the password to look up
information about users.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato declined to say what steps America Online was taking to
prevent the abuse. But he did confirm the report on Observers.net
that one measure would require AOL employees to log on using a
small electronic device that displays a numeric code that changes
every minute.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said that unlike other incidents in which hackers broke
into the computer systems of companies, the damage done would be
moderate, because the hacker would have to type in each user's name
separately to obtain the personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they can download a file with 10,000 users'
credit-card numbers,'' he said.

KIDS IN RAID ON CHURCH COMMUNITY HOLD REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 9th graf to change term to corporal punishment, stet
``beat''; ADDS 2 grafs with quotes 3 grafs from bottom.)

<P>
   ISLAND POND, Vt. _ Sixteen years after a swarm of Vermont
troopers rousted 112 children from their beds in an effort to
examine them for signs of abuse, those same children, all grown up
now, returned Sunday to this tiny community to swear publicly they
had felt happy and loved, not abused.
</P>
<P>
   The event fell near the 16th anniversary of the 1984 raid here
on a religious group then known as the Northeast Kingdom Community
Church. The group has since changed its name to the Twelve Tribes
Community and has established itself in 25 locations around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the raid, the state of Vermont, frustrated in its
effort to verify reports that church members were beating their
children in the name of religion, sent 90 state troopers and 50
social workers in the early morning of June 22 to round up the
children _ who ranged in age from 9 days to 17 years old _ and put
them on a Greyhound bus bound for the courthouse in the nearby town
of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, about 80 of the children rode a Greyhound bus back to
Island Pond to tell their side of the story. To a standing ovation
from their friends and parents, they bounded off the bus and
gathered behind a lectern beside Island Pond, at the center of
town. Lisa Campbell, who was, at age 17, the oldest child involved
in the raid, was the first to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that several police officers gathered us into the
living room to ask us our names and dates of birth,'' Campbell
said. ``As evidence of the supposed child abuse, the police were
picking up knitting needles and pieces of wood used to prop the
windows open. I remember thinking that this was all ridiculous
because I knew the truth: there was no abuse in our household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am the mother of four, and only now can I realize what
our parents went through for us on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the atmosphere of the event was much more one of
celebration than of recrimination: the day was part Christmas, part
Independence Day and part First Amendment rally, all rolled into
one.
</P>
<P>
   The children, as they are still called, performed a circle dance
in honor of what they refer to as their ``Day of Deliverance'' by
Vermont District Judge Frank Mahady, who held 40 individual
hearings with families that day, then set the children free after
finding that the state lacked sufficient evidence to hold them.
</P>
<P>
   Church members did not dispute that they were using corporal
punishment, but said they disciplined their children, usually with
thin rods, in the spirit of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of speech and freedom of religion were both at risk,''
said Ed Wiseman, one of the founding members of the community.
``The issue of religious persecution and discrimination against new
religions is an issue all over the world today. We see a great need
for government leaders to make sure that the information they're
receiving about these new minority groups is reliable. Not doing
that was what created the atmosphere of moral panic in the state of
Vermont in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   The community was founded in the 1970s and set down roots in the
deep forests of Vermont, about 20 miles from the Canadian border.
Church members live in communal houses and work in communally run
businesses, like a shoe store, a candle shop and a dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   The group tries to follow the Bible closely and create a
``Kingdom of God.'' Wiseman and others said discipline was
essential to a sense of self-worth and that lack of it was
destroying the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Sage is a child of the raid and now a mother herself. Like
the other children celebrating Sunday, she is still a member of the
church. Sage said it was ``a God-given right'' to discipline
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have a hard time with discipline,'' she told the
gathering of 300 to 400 people, many of them community members who
had come from throughout the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``But discipline comes from love,'' she said ``Without
discipline, children will not have any respect for God or for
authority. They have no sense that there are consequences for
disobedience. Discipline is not a joyful experience, it hurts, but
I never felt unwanted or unloved.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont State Trooper Wayne Dyer, now retired, was a participant
in both the raid and Sunday's event. In a statement that he wrote
for the gathering, Dyer called the raid ``a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals who were responsible for the raid were not brought
to justice and the state got off the hook with a small lawsuit from
the family of a child who happened to be visiting that day and was
scooped up,'' Dyer wrote. ``Without the constitution, the Island
Pond church would have been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other social service and law enforcement officials were
invited, but did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Philip White, who was the state prosecutor on the
case, told The Burlington Free Press, ``The first lesson is that it
is still O.K. to beat their children, especially if they have a
religious justification for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The second lesson,'' White, said, ``is that we still have not
found a satisfactory approach to preventing and addressing child
abuse issues when they occur in closed religious communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Crane, the former defender general who represented the
parents in the case, made the trip from Boston for the occasion.
``I had to be here,'' said Crane, who now runs an athletic and
academic program for inner-city children. ``What I worried about
most was the impact of the raid on those kids, so it was a real
thrill to see them come running out of that bus.''

JACKSON LASTS IN A LEAGUE OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Mark Jackson attended the Oscar De La
Hoya-Shane Mosley fight on Saturday night, trying to blow off steam
with teammates before Game 6 of the NBA finals. Among those
accompanying the 35-year-old point guard to the Staples Center were
Jonathan Bender, a willowy 19-year-old, who last June was attending
his senior prom, and Al Harrington, 20, two years removed from high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got them popcorn and those cinnamon churros, or whatever you
call them,'' Jackson said. ``They were excited. But no Coke. Water
instead. I didn't want them to have too much sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsible patriarch of the Indiana Pacers roster spoke on
Father's Day, slightly more than a year after his own father died.
Someone asked Jackson if the Pacers' attempt to come back from a
three-games-to-one deficit in the National Basketball Association
finals was the hardest thing he ever had to do on a basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing after losing my father,'' he said. ``That was simply
the hardest. If I look back and think how I did it, it had nothing
to do with me. It was all God. There were times when I wanted to
roll over and put my head under the pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson gathered himself and forged on. As he has been doing
for much of the last four or five seasons, he lived on instincts,
skill and smarts to keep up with the NBA's kids and compensate for
his lack of athleticism. One of the few pass-first point guards
left in the league is now two victories from a championship,
blemishes in his game and all.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after he was drafted out of St. John's, you
wonder which odds should have been longer: on Jackson playing this
long or the Pacers becoming the first team in finals history to
erase a 3-1 deficit and win in seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you leave it to the critics, probably about the same,'' he
said through a half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have referred to him as a slow-footed point guard.
``Some people even say a very slow-footed point guard,'' Jackson
said. ``When you look around and guys are on vacation now that
don't have half as many question marks as I have _ and to know that
God has put me in a position to have a Game 6 and to be the maestro
of a championship-caliber team, a guy that's as limited as me, I
can't help but thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a free agent after this season, and there is no
guarantee he will return to the Pacers _ although putting the
floor-leader duties exclusively in Travis Best's hands does not
seem like the wisest move Indiana could make in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his physical limitations, Jackson still knows how to
find the open man, whether it is Reggie Miller materializing on the
perimeter from the morass of bodies in the paint or Jalen Rose
sneaking along the baseline. A prospective coaching career _ Rick
Pitino recently said he thought Jackson would become the next great
young coach in the game _ will most likely be put on hold for at
least two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The competition and the kids still enrapture Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the state of basketball in general, it's a tremendous
lesson,'' he said. ``Rather than working on some things that can
get you endorsements and praise, work on some things that can get
you here in June. Work on some things that's going to get you a
ring. Work on some things that can separate you from the pack as a
winner. Be students of the game. I learned that going to college
and watching Chris Mullin every single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I watch guys run around like chickens without heads and I
realize that was me once.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before Game 6, Jackson recalled draft day in 1987, when
he was picked in the first round by the Knicks. ``You're thinking,
`I made it,''' he said. ``I didn't put a timetable on myself
because a lot of people didn't think I would make it. I didn't
think about playing 13 years. I was just tickled I actually
arrived. I wanted to prolong it as long as I actually could.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's been a great ride. To know there's still some
gas left in the tank makes it more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says the Pacers ``rebuked the demons'' in Game 5, in
which the Pacers annihilated the Lakers, 120-87. He likes his
team's resilience, its ability to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a few years now, when our back is against the wall, we've
responded,'' he said. ``And we've been a lot of places. So this
isn't anything that stands out right now. This isn't nothing new to
me or this basketball team. And if I have to go down swinging with
a bunch of guys, this is the group I want to go down with.''
</P>
<P>
   His three children were back in Indiana and could speak to their
father Sunday only by telephone. He would have to make do with
Bender and Harrington, the Pacers kids he took to the fight on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of what it's going to take in this series,''
Jackson said of Mosley's thrilling victory by split decision. ``If
you want it, rather than sitting back, dancing and jabbing, you got
to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be some finish, watching the Pacers move the ball for
two more games and blend together seamlessly, five as one. Knocking
off the heavily favored Lakers of Shaq and Kobe would be an amazing
story, almost as amazing as a very slow-footed point guard playing
13 years.

BAD WEATHER MEANS MONDAY AT POCONO 500 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ For only the second time in 27 years, a Nascar
event was postponed here when the Pocono 500 Winston Cup race was
called off Sunday because of persistent rain and enveloping fog.
</P>
<P>
   The race was rescheduled for Monday at 10 a.m. by race teams
eager to get to the circuit's next stop, in Sonoma, Calif., and
before the crowd thins out because of the beginning of the work
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this just prolongs the agony,'' said Larry McReynolds,
crew chief for the Lowe's Chevrolet team driven by Mike Skinner,
which will start in the seventh position Monday morning. ``Somebody
stuck another pin in the voodoo doll. You really don't change that
much here for the weather conditions. I don't know what we'll do
different tomorrow than we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nascar officials waited 2 hours 23 minutes past the 1 p.m. start
time before deciding that a layer of fog obscuring parts of the
two-and-a-half-mile speedway compounded the danger on an already
slick racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1979, the early summer Pocono Winston Cup race was
rescheduled for the following day because of rain and was won by
Cale Yarborough in a memorable duel with Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup teams will now be pressed to get to the Save
Mart/Kragen 350 next Sunday at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jellen, who is charged with getting the cars and equipment
to the West Coast for the Winston Cup points leader, Bobby Labonte,
says the quick turnaround means a tense cross-country drive. ``You
can't have a flat, you can't have scale trouble, can't have truck
trouble,'' Jellen said.
</P>
<P>
   When the flag drops on the Pocono 500, Rusty Wallace will lead
the 43-car field to the green flag. He turned a lap in 52.440
seconds, a record average speed of 171.625 miles an hour, to win
his fifth pole of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's teammate, Tony Stewart, will start from the ninth
position and try to win his third race in a row.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, a Lehigh Valley native, will start second in his
homecoming race. His hopes are tempered, however, by the fact that
last year in the two races here he was knocked out by accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why be too optimistic?'' he said. ``I think if we see the
checkered flag, it will probably be a bonus.'' &QL;

   I was at a midtown florist shop, waiting for my wife's birthday
bouquet to be completed, when a New York City firefighter in full

take precedence. He explained that he was running late for a date
to meet his girlfriend on the observation deck of the Empire State
Building.
</P>
<P>
   He said they were fans of the 1994 Warren Beatty and Annette
Bening movie, ``Love Affair,'' in which a key event was a meeting
at the Empire State. That day was his girlfriend's birthday and he
was going to pop the question _ the engagement ring was in his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   I got a lump in my throat. I explained that the original 1957
movie ``An Affair to Remember,'' with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr,
played an integral part in the romance and engagement of me and my
wife over 42 years ago. I wished him luck and off he went. An
incurable romantic, I wonder if she said yes.

   May 21, 2000. The first baseball game of my son, Marcus, almost
3 _ and my birthday. A great combination to start, but hold on,
this really gets going.
</P>
<P>
   We begin at the ticket line at Shea Stadium. A lovely couple in
their mid-40s walk up to us. ``Would you like these box seats?''
they ask. ``We have a few extra.'' Happy day! Upon entrance to the
ballpark, we are handed Mets jerseys because it's Mets Jersey Day.
Happy, happy day! We go get a hot dog. A fellow asks if we want to
sign up for a credit card and get a free mitt. Thank you. Happier
day! We go back to our seats and my son laments, ``How come they're
not hitting me the ball, Daddy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have patience,'' I say. ``You just be ready.''
Fifth inning. Mets tie the score. Edgardo Alfonzo steps up to the
plate, hits a pop fly down the first-base line and _ you guessed it
_ we got it. Marcus in my lap and we caught the ball! The crowd
went wild. Happiest birthday ever!
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Oh, yeah, Mets get the winning run, bottom of the ninth.

   Ron Tomme always liked the story told to him by an actress on
one of the major soap operas at that time. Her role on the soap was
that of a Broadway star. One day, shopping in Bloomingdale's, she
was approached by a fan. ``Tell me,'' the fan said, ``are you an
actress in real life?''

   Looking out the window of his Upper West Side apartment one
recent morning, Harold S. Spitzer noticed a man on the other side
of the street pulling a handcart loaded with new telephone
directories. The man passed an oversized carton on its side, the
rags and paper around it signifying that it was the abode of a
homeless person. The man stopped, looked back and then took a
telephone directory from the top of the pile, placed it gently in
front of the open carton and continued on his way.

solve: Sara Landis was on a bus crossing 23rd Street during a rush
hour. The bus hit every red light and traffic was at a standstill.
As she stood up for her stop, she said sympathetically to the
driver, ``You caught all the stops, didn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he replied, and then added, ``it's all the
people getting on and off that slows me down.'' She got off _ fast!

</P>
<P>
   I would urge them to sample
</P>

   new approaches to old problems
</P>
<P>
   and to try appreciation
</P>
<P>
   for everything they take for granted.

   The recent news article about boys' superior knowledge of
geography reminded Susan Jacobs of a conversation she overheard
while working out at a health club. One of the young trainers,
obviously not a native New Yorker, asked his client for suggestions
on where he should take his parents when they visited. The client
ran through the usual tourist sites, evoking little interest, and
finally he mentioned a cruise on the Circle Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' the trainer asked. The client replied that it
was a tour boat that circled Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great idea,'' the trainer exclaimed. ``I love boat
rides. Will we be sailing on the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all boys know geography!

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   When I was 18, I got my first job, at the Woolworth Building at
233 Broadway at Park Place. My salary was $10 a week and I worked
as a file clerk on the 10th floor. I lived with my parents and
eight brothers and sisters in a tenement in Brooklyn and we had
just the bare necessities of life. Each day as I entered the
Woolworth Building I stood in amazement, admiring the mosaic
ceiling and the beautiful woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at the age of 88, I again went to the Woolworth
Building, this time with a different reaction _ much pride and a
full heart. My eldest son, Bruce Clark, a lawyer, occupies the
entire 36th floor!

DE LA HOYA TALKS OF RETIREMENT WHILE PROMOTER TALKS OF REMATCH WITH
MOSLEY
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hands on hips, Oscar De La Hoya stood alone in his
corner of the ring, stunned by the decision. His promoter, Bob
Arum, leaned against the ropes and looked stone-faced into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   According to De La Hoya, his welterweight title loss to Shane
Mosley on Saturday night could be his last fight. As a surprised
Arum listened after the split decision was awarded to Mosley, the
27-year-old De La Hoya announced that retirement was one option he
was considering after suffering the second defeat of his heretofore
golden career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to rethink my whole game plan in life,'' said De La
Hoya. who is 32-2 after losing two of his last three fights. ``I'm
considering a lot of things. We all know this is a business, and a
rematch would make a lot of money, but I'm not looking at it that
way. Right now, I'm thinking about my health, my career, my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added: ``A lot of things go on in your head after a
fight. It'll take me a few days to rethink things.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another in a series of classic De La Hoya contradictions,
the least of which was his performance in the later rounds before a
crowd of 20,744 at the Staples Center. Mosley (35-0) dominated from
the seventh round on, including a ferocious slugfest in the 12th
and final round, to capture the WBC welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Despite evidence to the contrary, De La Hoya believed he had won
the fight by a point, clinging to the notion that the defending
champion should receive the benefit of the doubt in a split
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Two judges saw the fight quite differently, though, with Pat
Russell giving Mosley the last six rounds and Lou Filippo scoring
five of the last six for Mosley. Russell (115-113) and Filippo
(116-112) had Mosley winning, while Marty Sammon thought De La Hoya
had won, 115-113. All three judges scored the final round for
Mosley. Still, if De La Hoya had won that round, Russell's score
would have been 114-114 and De La Hoya would have kept the title at
147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not give it a draw?'' De La Hoya said. ``Why take it away
from me like that? It's not justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see things like this happen, it turns me off. It's
tough to live with what goes on around boxing. I just don't feel I
can continue on like this. He deserves it. He's a good champion. I
have no problem with him winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-win situation. What if I do box Shane Mosley? I
would not get the decision. In my mind, when I didn't get the
knockout, I said forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya had plenty of chances to floor Mosley for the first
time in the challenger's career. Instead, Mosley recovered from
early danger, wore down De La Hoya with his speedy attacks and
clinched the victory with a devastating finish.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting at will with his right hand, Mosley outscored De La
Hoya, 45-18, in punches landed in the 12th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was flat-footed and wasn't much of a boxer in that round,''
Mosley said. ``He didn't bounce and move like I've seen him do.''
</P>
<P>
   In only his third fight since moving up two classes to
welterweight, Mosley impressively weathered De La Hoya's power and
consistently beat him to the punch, especially with quick jabs.
Mosley landed 42 percent of his punches (284) to 36 percent (257)
for De La Hoya. ``I was never really hurt,'' Mosley said. ``I got
hit with good shots, but I never got hurt where I was wobbled. This
was my time. This takes my career to another level. I just had to
make sure I had enough energy to close the show out in the 12th
round.''
</P>
<P>
   A rematch loomed even as Mosley's celebration swirled around the
ring. Mosley had agreed to one before signing the contract to fight
De La Hoya. Arum said he expected the two fighters to meet again in
November if details can be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to consider Los Angeles; however, Las Vegas would
have to be in the running to bid on this rematch,'' Arum said.

WHITE SOX POUND HERNANDEZ FOR A SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES thruout with update on injury to Hernandez)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez trudged a few feet behind the
mound, allowed a new ball to tumble out of his glove and crouched
down like a catcher. El Duque stared at the grass below his cleats
for about 10 seconds that felt more like 10 minutes. Hernandez
looked uncomfortable. Everyone on the Yankees felt uneasy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin had just smashed a grand slam and the White Sox
already had nine runs in the first inning when Hernandez dropped
the ball, lowered his head and waited for the inevitable. Manager
Joe Torre was fast approaching and the boos were escalating so El
Duque stood, scooped up the ball, handed it to Torre and ended his
brief debacle with a wounded ego and a sprained right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle was not brief for the rest of the Yankees. It
stretched across nine torturous innings, culminating in a 17-4 loss
to the White Sox. On Saturday, the Yankees had rallied from an 8-0
deficit before losing, 10-9, but they had no dramatic rallies on
this gray, gloomy day and were swept in a four-game series at
Yankee Stadium for the first time since the White Sox did it in
July 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it's embarrassing,'' Torre said, ``but you
sure don't like getting your butt kicked like we have over this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were despondent after the White Sox outscored them
by 42-17 in the series, with Torre referring to this slide as ``a
blow to the organization'' and General Manager Brian Cashman
saying, ``We're playing as bad as we can play.'' The anxiety
increased because El Duque was found to have a sprained elbow after
he underwent X-rays and a magnetic resonance imaging test at Beth
Israel North Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are unsure whether Hernandez , their leading winner,
will make his next start against the White Sox on Friday in
Chicago, and they are hopeful that he does not have to join Roger
Clemens on the 15-day disabled list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously not an immediate DL situation,'' Cashman said.
``We think he'll make a start. We're not ruling out Friday, but
we're not guaranteeing it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said that doctors prescribed rest for Hernandez and that
he would be re-evaluated this week, but it seems improbable that he
will be able to make his scheduled start. With Clemens sidelined,
the team will monitor Hernandez and decide if he can pitch within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would probably allow El Duque to miss a start, but
it would be logical to place him on the disabled list if he had to
miss more than one.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Hernandez, who missed a start in May
because of an upper back injury, has had elbow complications,
adding to an already bleak situation for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Torre said, ``you have to sit back and take it.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have held repeated discussions about acquiring the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa or Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, and this
drought could intensify the owner George Steinbrenner's desire to
improve the team. After losing for the sixth time in seven games,
the Yankees (34-29) remained a half game behind the first-place Red
Sox, whom they play in a four-game series starting Monday night in
Boston. But, suddenly, the Blue Jays trail the Yankees by a half
game.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman reiterated that there were more quality position players
available than pitchers and acknowledged that the Yankees' poor
play could make a trade tougher to execute. The Yankees are hanging
on and are fortunate that the other teams in the American League
East have also been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dropping 16 of 28 games, the Yankees have gained a half
game. Still, the standings cannot hide a struggling team that was
down by 9-0 after one inning, by 12-0 after two and by 16-0 after
five. The Yankees had not allowed nine in a first inning since
1979, and the White Sox had not scored nine in a first in 38 years.
Derek Jeter was 16 the last time the Yankees were battered for 17
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it concerns you,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``You don't
want someone to come in and embarrass you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (6-6) looked as if he might have hurt himself on the
first batter of the game. He sprinted to cover first on Ray
Durham's grounder to Tino Martinez and jumped for the base,
buckling as he landed and perhaps hurting his back.
</P>
<P>
   Then the devastation began. After Hernandez walked Valentin,
Frank Thomas laced a booming double to make the score 1-0. El Duque
walked a batter and Paul Konerko singled home a run, prompting an
injury visit from Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. Hernandez
told Stottlemyre that he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Singleton smashed a two-run double and Carlos Lee
singled in a run to put the Yankees in a 5-0 hole. Hernandez was
not fine. His fastball was limping and his usually impeccable
control was awry. El Duque threw first pitch balls to 6 of 11
batters and went to four three-ball counts, which resulted in three
walks and the grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez tugged on his jersey, adjusted his cap and dug around
the dirt, searching for a comfort zone. He gave up two singles to
the next three batters and later told Torre he first felt pain in
his elbow on the No. 9 batter Mark Johnson's single.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though Stottlemyre and Jorge Posada both quizzed
Hernandez on how he felt, he continued pitching. Hernandez threw 11
pitches after feeling the pain, walking Durham and surrendering
Valentin's grand slam on a weak 3-2 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know he's hurt, you don't dare'' let him pitch, Torre
said. ``I'm sorry he went two more hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Hernandez toil for two thirds of an inning shocked some
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they were getting cheap hits,'' Jeter said.
``It was like a couple of guys on and `Bam!' A couple of guys on
and `Bam!' Before you knew it, it was 9-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you knew it, the Yankees had flopped again. Torre
speculated that teams are bound to get even with the Yankees after
they dominated baseball for three of the last four years. That
trend might be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've enjoyed ourselves for four years,'' Torre said. ``We're
on our heels and we need to bounce back. We sort of know now what
other clubs felt when they played us.''

   VIVENDI, SEAGRAM BOARDS MEET TO CONSIDER MERGER
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both Vivendi and Seagram met over the weekend to
weigh Vivendi's $33 billion acquisition of Seagram. A decision was
expected as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final price is still being negotiated, a person close to the

   WHEN ASSAULT VICTIMS ARE IDENTIFIED
</P>
<P>
   Amateur videos taken in New York during the attacks on dozens of
women after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11 were
widely disseminated, but usually with the women's faces blurred so
they could not be identified. But on five news programs and in The
New York Post, the women were clearly identifiable, several with
their shirts taken off and others with no clothes at all. The
coverage showed how competition can overtake news organizations in
a 24-hour news cycle and how questionable ethical decisions made by
one outlet can influence others.
</P>
<P>
   BANKS PUSH ONE-STOP SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   Banks and brokerage firms are racing to offer the newest thing
in online financial services: a single place where customers can
find up-to-date information about all of their financial accounts.
Less than a year ago, big financial firms saw this innovation,
known as account aggregation, as a threat to their customers'
privacy and financial security. But now, fearing an onslaught of
competition on the Internet, they are embracing it as a convenience
for customers and a powerful tool for building their own business.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONING A MICROSOFT INITIATIVE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to announce a new initiative this week that
would shift the locus of computing off the desktop and out into a
``cloud'' of large server computers located on the Internet. The
goal is to maintain a central role for Microsoft's software. But an
influential critic, David Gelernter, said the plan misjudged the
computer industry's direction _ that rather than moving to an
increasingly Web-centric model, computing is instead becoming
rapidly decentralized, with the key information distributed among
millions of individual desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   GUIDEPOSTS MAGAZINE TO ACCEPT ADS
</P>
<P>
   Guideposts magazine, founded by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale 55
years ago, has been spinning out stories filled with hope and
inspiration, and it has refused to run any form of advertising. But
that is about to change. Faced with the same problems that are
affecting the rest of the subscription-only magazine industry,
Guideposts has decided to start accepting advertising in January,
albeit from ``wholesome'' sources.
</P>
<P>
   GENOMICS AS THE NEW NEW THING
</P>
<P>
   Soon, perhaps within days, researchers expect to announce
completion of the decade-long project to map the human genome.
Stand by for the New Genomics to become the next big thing in the
New Economy. Aided by extensive computer processing power, the
genome researchers have been engaged in what is essentially a giant
software project. Sequencing the human genome involves sifting
through the 3 billion units of DNA at the heart of every human cell
to identify the 80,000 or so genes that define all inheritable
physical and behavioral traits.
</P>
<P>
   AETNA SAID TO REJECT ING OFFER
</P>
<P>
   ING Groep, based in the Netherlands, said Aetna had rejected its
offer to buy Aetna's financial-services and international units
because it was not high enough. ING also confirmed that Aetna was
talking with other companies about buying those divisions.

A SUMMER IN AMERICA, WITH A FOCUS ON HEALTH, FOR `CHILDREN OF
CHERNOBYL' 
</HEADLINE>
   By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Thirkield of Cincinnati paced in the terminal at
Kennedy International Airport on Saturday evening like an expectant
father in a hospital waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel like I'm about to have a baby when I do this,''
said Thirkield, 76, a retired businessman and sometime pilot,
tugging at his collar.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkield was one of 26 pilots, all volunteers, who were
awaiting the arrival of 154 ``children of Chernobyl,'' sickened by
the aftermath of the worst nuclear accident in history. The pilots
were to fly the children, ages 8 to 15, to host families across the
United States for a summer of medical care and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   While these children are not terminally ill, their health
suffers from the fallout of the 1986 disaster, when fire ripped
through a nuclear reactor in Ukraine, killing 28 people outright
and spewing radiation over vast stretches of northeastern Europe.
Over the years, the high levels of radiation lingering in the area
have caused thousands of deaths and illnesses, particularly thyroid
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of these children were not even born when the
accident occurred, they have mouth sores and respiratory problems
and are prone to illnesses because of their weakened immune
systems. Here, they will receive basic medical care _ visits to
pediatricians, eye doctors and dentists _ which their families
cannot afford at home.
</P>
<P>
   This was Thirkield's third year with the eight-week program,
sponsored by Children of Chernobyl, a nonprofit group based in
Youngstown, Ohio, and AirLifeLine, a group of pilots who give poor
patients free flights to receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like my children,'' Thirkield said. ``By the end of
the summer, their eyes shine a little bit brighter. You ask them
what their favorite food is, and they say McDonald's and pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The program began in 1992 with 11 children. Since then, with
more American families willing to be hosts, the number of children
has grown steadily, said Joe Knable, 44, the president of Children
of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that their parents are willing to send them on a
plane to a country they themselves have never been to, to have them
spend a summer with a family they've never met, says something
about how much these children need this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the children, this was their first time away from
home, and for some, who had been helped by the program before, it
was a much-anticipated return trip. One child draped himself in an
American flag, and another sported a T-shirt plastered with the boy
band 'N Sync, her favorite American singing group.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia Sergeeva, 10, who made the trip last year from Minsk,
in Belarus, said through a translator that everything here was
``brighter and shinier.'' She said she made so many new friends
during her trip last year that she could not ``count them on my
fingers and toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Volochkovich, 11, arrived after traveling more than 30
hours from Chechelnyk, his village in Ukraine. ``I cannot believe I
am finally here,'' said Sergei, whose host family is in Ohio.
Dropping his duffel bag on the ground, he stretched his arms out
and twirled.

Born at the earliest fringe of the baby boom, George W. Bush was
pressed in his years at Yale, 1964 to 1968, to take sides in the
great battles then unfolding over politics, civil rights, drugs and
music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those upheavals, but when
forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the values and ideals
established by his parents' generation. (The New York Times/George

   (NYT11) LIVINGSTON, Texas -- June 18, 2000 -- DEATHROW-COX --
Whether they proclaim themselves guilty or innocent, some inmates
have taken advantage of the escalating national debate over the

just the elderly but also children and low-income adults, is
unmatched by any other state. Lorraine Lacaillade, 75, of Bolton,

Much has changed in Mexico to make the current campaign for the

the governing party's long-entrenched practices of vote-buying,
coercion and doling out of pork. In fact, some election observers

`LITTLE MAN' SHAQ IS JUST ENJOYING LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a guy averaging more than 37 points and 17
rebounds during the final round of the NBA tournament, causing
havoc usually reserved for yellow-iron construction equipment, it
is remarkable that the transcendent moment for Shaquille O'Neal
came when he simply stood.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who else can stand like a 7-foot-1, 315-pound
panther?
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Game 4, end of regulation, Pacers' ball, chance to
win a magnificent game with one shot. The smallest, quickest man on
the court, Indiana's 5-11 Travis Best, is, thanks to a defensive
switch, isolated on the big man, who is crippled by five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' said Best later, ``pretty happy about that matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   A good little man in basketball always thinks he can get a shot
off against a lumbering big man. Quick feet and a quick release are
always the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Except against the Lakers center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reacting, Best found himself thinking _ the worst
thing to do with the clock running down and the defender, hands up,
looming large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could go to the hole on him,'' Best said. ``But at
the same time, I was below the free throw line, and I felt if I did
get by him, he still had enough space to catch up and make a play
on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable going to the hole unless I really
had him off-balance. I was able to get him off-balance, acting like
I was going to the hole, and I raised up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; rr &LR; ``The shot was short. I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was fear, and it became the turning point in the
series. Failing to drive because O'Neal- is almost as agile as he
is big, Best's tepid, fallaway 15-foot jumper over outstretched,
outsized mitts had no chance. It forced the overtime where the
Lakers won, 120-118, giving them the lone victory in the three
matches in Indianapolis, and, for all intents, the 3-2 lead they
carry into the sixth game Monday night in Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for meaning for the much-abused sports lingo,
``the man,'' O'Neal helped the project along with that moment. When
one alters a game, and probably a series, merely by standing, he is
... well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   To call him the big man states the obvious. However, call him
the little man, and you're on your way to some serious
ingratiation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Best matchup was a big man's worst nightmare,
O'Neal scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I'm a little man trapped in a big man's body.
All big guys want to be little guards.''
</P>
<P>
   The little man in O'Neal is not an abstraction, but just one of
a number of virtuous aspects emerging in this series about the
league's Most Valuable Player. Along with the overwhelming play
that finally has him linked properly in the same sentence with Wilt
Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell, it is O'Neal's
demeanor and personality that have become nearly as noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you whose televised exposure to O'Neal has been his
mumbling, cliched responses to group-interview questions, well,
that's a darn shame. Away from that stilted forum, yet sometimes
even within it, O'Neal is offering up a refreshingly adolescent
exuberance about his life and creations. As successful as was Tom
Hanks in ``Big,'' the movie blew it by not casting O'Neal as the
full-grown child.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for Seattle fans to appreciate what is to them merely
a massive, glowering obstacle to a return to NBA prominence. So
let's put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Griffey Jr. had as much fun being Junior that O'Neal has
being Shaq, he not only wouldn't be hitting .230 in Cincinnati, he
wouldn't be in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, O'Neal's recent emotional growth has been almost as
impressive as his physical spurt a decade earlier. He and the
Lakers couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference the other day in Naptown, O'Neal
stopped questioners before they began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you all should try one of these muffins, because these
muffins is real good,'' he said. Then he smiled, flashing the
muffin smashed against his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Just the kind of thing one would expect from a dopey kid brother
at the breakfast table _ not the somber inheritor of the
Chamberlain-Kareem legacy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, after he had written a flattering column about
O'Neal as MVP, ex-P-I sportswriter Bill Plaschke, now of the Los
Angeles Times, was greeted at Lakers practice by the big man and
asked if he really meant what he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, said Plaschke, whereupon he was hugged by O'Neal, who
proceeded to hop with the startled writer for several seconds. Even
though afterward he claimed to be too sore to write, Plaschke
counted the moment unique in his experiences with superstar
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of painful embraces, that is what opponents often do to
O'Neal in the absence of any plausible alternative defense. Even as
recently as last season, Hack-a-Shaq sometimes fueled a reckless
rage in him, as did the hard fouls that went uncalled by referees
simply because of his extraordinary physical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, O'Neal barely flinches, and almost never complains. No
longer can teams count on him becoming flustered and distracted,
despite the fact that the annoying clobberings force him to expose
to the world his lone vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the tactic ``The Big Homage'' to his game, he practices
free throws relentlessly and betrays no shame at his persistent
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I shot 80 percent,'' O'Neal mused the other day, ``I
wouldn't even bother talking to you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But he smiled (muffin-free, this time) and everyone laughed.
</P>
<P>
   That is what a lot of people do around him these days, as long
as they aren't responsible for keeping him off the low blocks or
snatching a rebound from him.
</P>
<P>
   He is the rare modern sports star who is appreciative of his
station in life. Instead of abusing it, he chooses to savor. As
Charles Barkley understood best and most splendidly before him, it
is a good thing. Mumbles notwithstanding, O'Neal is learning to
share it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough he will be a champion, be it Monday or Wednesday.
Then he will be villainized even more than he already had been in
the minds of basketball fans everywhere but Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, too. As Chamberlain was once told, nobody loves
Goliath. Basketball fans pay huge money for the privilege of
heckling him, and he is paid huge money to take it.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NBA Finals close out, it might be fun to do what
Travis Best did and stop to consider for a moment the large man
ahead (hey, you don't have to get a shot off).
</P>
<P>
   Consider that in the body of the giant warrior, there is a
little man dying to get out _ the quick guard, the kid brother, the
class clown, the good teammate, the solid citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, a man at peace.

GORE'S PLAN WILL OFFER VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS TO SOME
TAXPAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky.) 
(CLARIFIES that investments must be made through account managers
in 7th graf)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore plans in a speech on Tuesday
to propose a $200 billion program to help low- and middle-income
taxpayers build retirement accounts separate from what they will
receive from Social Security, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Gore aides, the program would work the way
401(k) savings plans work, but instead of employer contributions,
the federal government would make contributions in the form of tax
credits, providing in some cases up to a 3-to-1 match.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``retirement savings plus,'' the plan would offer tax
relief for couples with combined annual incomes of up to $100,000,
or individuals making up to $50,000. Gore's program would provide
the greatest benefit for couples with incomes of less than $30,000.
The program would cost the government $200 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary program, designed to compete with Gov. George W.
Bush's proposal for individuals to invest an unspecified portion of
their Social Security payroll tax in the stock market, would create
a fund for each participant that could expand by a maximum of
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple making up to $30,000 a year could contribute up
to $500 annually. They would then receive a refundable tax credit
of $1,500, bringing their account to $2,000. A couple making
$100,000 could contribute $1,500 to their account and earn a tax
credit of $500.
</P>
<P>
   Like IRAs and 401(k) plans, contributions to the accounts would
be tax deducible, accounts would grow tax-free and withdrawals
would be taxed. Private financial institutions would manage the
accounts. According to Gore aides, participation in the program
over 35 years of work would yield an individual about $200,000 for
retirement over and above Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does two things that Gore had earlier criticized in
the plan offered by his Republican rival. One, it allows people to
invest taxpayer money in the stock market through the account
managers. Two, it substantially increases the amount of the federal
budget surplus that Gore would devote to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been fiercely critical of Bush for
devoting 1.3 trillion dollars of the surplus to an across-the-board
income tax cut over 10 years. But now, with this new savings plan,
Gore's total of targeted tax cuts clocks in at $500 billion over 10
years, twice what he had proposed before, and half of Bush's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, in interviews Sunday, said that the Gore plan is
a hedge against what they see as the risky alternative that Bush is
proposing. They said financial institutions would be limited to
offering investment options based on broad-based mutual funds for
equities, bonds and government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore intends to lay out the plan in a speech on Tuesday in
Lexington, Ky. The speech comes at the beginning of the second week
of his three-week ``progress and prosperity tour'' (sometimes
called the ``prosperity and progress tour'' by Gore) in which he is
traveling to key battleground states to try to get credit for the
nation's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement plan is a vivid example of how Gore is trying to
take advantage of the burgeoning federal budget surplus by spending
it on targeted groups of voters whom he needs to win over in
November _ in this case, low-income and middle-income working
families, the core Democratic base that polls have indicated are
slipping from Gore's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Gore's proposal revealed a weakening of his
stance against putting taxpayer money in the financial markets and
would thus contribute to an overall impression of Gore as someone
without reliable core values.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week the vice president will flip flop flip by coming out
for the use of tax money to be invested in the market to help
people retire,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's campaign spokesman.
``It's his third position in six months on the soundness of using
tax money to invest in markets to secure people's retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer pointed to the Clinton administration's now abandoned
position laid out in this year's budget proposal to allow
government-controlled investments in the markets, and then to a
Gore speech in May when he criticized Bush's plan to allow people
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing this to blunt Governor Bush's approach to allow
people to invest in the markets to help them retire with more
money,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer was talking about Gore's retirement plan, but he was
not the only one suggesting Sunday that Gore was perhaps going
through multiple reinventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new campaign chairman, William Daley, the commerce
secretary, made the rounds of the television talk shows Sunday and
was asked repeatedly about the vice president's continually
evolving personas.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Russert posed the question on the NBC program ``Meet The
Press'': ``Fairly or unfairly, there's a perception that Al Gore
has changed positions on abortion, on gun control, Elian Gonzalez,
wearing earth tones, wearing sports shirts, wearing coats and ties,
changing campaign chairmen, moving from Washington to Nashville,
suddenly in favor of a $500 billion tax cut _ that Gore has no
center, that he flips and panders as a politician. Is that a
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Daley replied, ``There's a problem because those are all
misconceptions that have been developed by either the opposition or
by media who aren't really following this day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The fact of the matter is, Al Gore has been
consistent about working for the average man and woman out there
and trying to address their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor has been tepid lately toward Gore, both for
his support for a bill to make normal trade relations permanent
with China and for naming Daley as his chairman to replace the
ailing Tony Coelho. Daley led the administration's fight on Capitol
Hill to pass the trade bill, which labor vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Sunday that he had talked with several labor leaders
over the last few days, including John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO, who met with Gore on Friday to complain about the Daley
appointment. Daley suggested his talks with labor leaders had been
fruitful and said he expected to meet with Sweeney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other Gore aides spent the day briefing reporters on the
retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   They said that while the chief goal of the plan would be to
provide a cushion for retirement nest eggs, participants could
withdraw their savings at any time without penalty for three
specific purposes: to cover catastrophic health expenses, to help
buy a first home, or to pay for a child's college education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan would encourage the rate of personal
savings, which has plunged to more than half the previous total
over the last decade. And they said that at a rate of return of 5.3
percent, an account for an individual could grow to $202,000 over
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that the program would be simplified by
having the Internal Revenue Service create a mechanism to deposit
people's tax credit and a share of their tax refunds directly into
the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' according to briefing paper prepared by the Gore
campaign, ``with a simple check-off on your tax return, workers
could see up to $2,000 each deposited in the `retirement savings
plus' each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan is based on the universal savings accounts
proposed in the 1999 State of the Union address by President
Clinton, a complex proposal that never made it through Congress.

   (NYT14) NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- June 18, 2000 -- BUSH-BIO-III --
Born at the earliest fringe of the baby boom, George W. Bush was
pressed in his years at Yale, 1964 to 1968, to take sides in the
great battles then unfolding over politics, civil rights, drugs and
music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those upheavals, but when
forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the values and ideals
established by his parents' generation. (The New York Times/George

Much has changed in Mexico to make the current campaign for the

the governing party's long-entrenched practices of vote-buying,
coercion and doling out of pork. In fact, some election observers

BIOSCOPE: BIOTECH GIANTS' COURT FIGHT OVER CREDIT COULD BE
WORTH  MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Patent fights are an everyday occurrence in
biotech, but a new dispute between Chiron Corp. and Genentech Inc.
has several elements that rise above the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   First off, we have two of the Bay Area's biotech giants arguing
over which of them deserves credit _ and royalties _ for the
scientific advance behind the breast cancer treatment Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is a Genentech product that belongs to a new class of
therapeutic compounds called monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonals
latch on to specific targets, called antigens, on the surface of
cancer cells. Thus monoclonals are the therapeutic equivalent of
guided missiles, which seek out and destroy sick cells.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a patent application first filed in 1984, Chiron
Corp. sued Genentech Inc. earlier this month in federal court in
Sacramento. According to Chiron, scientists at Cetus Corp., a
defunct firm that is now part of Chiron, first discovered and
patented the principle of using monoclonals to target breast cancer
antigens.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron says Cetus scientists patented this breast cancer
strategy before Genentech began work on Herceptin. Although Cetus
filed its original application in 1984, it was not until April that
Chiron finally won a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chiron thinks this patent entitles it to a share of the $188
million Genentech earned last year on Herceptin, plus a slice of
future sales. The suit doesn't mention figures but Chiron patent
attorney Robert Blackburn said royalties of 10 percent are common
in similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech patent attorney Sean Johnston rejected Chiron's claims
on several grounds. To begin, Genentech will argue that in the
early 1980s, many scientists were hunting for monoclonal antibodies
to target breast cancer antigens. Johnston said Cetus did not make
the discovery in question, and in any event, its approach turned
out to be a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cetus and Chiron scientists were not the first to identify the
... antigen on breast cancer cells,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever early contributions Cetus made, the fact remains that
Genentech spent several hundred million dollars to put Herceptin
through years of animal and human experiments to prove it safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron apparently did little or nothing. As Blackburn put it,
Chiron ``cannot say whether or not Cetus pursued the technology''
in question.
</P>
<P>
   But under U.S. law, that doesn't matter, Blackburn said. Even if
an inventor fails to commercialize a patented discovery, no one
else can use it without paying a royalty. Some European countries
do have use-it-or-lose-it provisions in their patent law. The
United States does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from Genentech,'' Blackburn
said. ``They did the clinical trials that pushed this monoclonal
through the regulatory process. But they didn't discover the
antigen.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech will attack Chiron's claims on several fronts. In
addition to asserting that Cetus didn't make the discovery first,
Genentech will question the convoluted history of the Cetus patent.
The application was filed in January 1984 but went through several
revisions before it was issued on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a patent granted almost 16 years after the
fact,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has six patents of its own on Herceptin. All were
filed in 1988 and granted around 1997. But Genentech's patents
could be trumped if the court upholds the earlier Cetus
application.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn said that over the years, Chiron and Genentech have
discussed whether Genentech should take out a license from Chiron.
After the patent was issued in April, Chiron made another attempt
to negotiate a royalty. When Genentech refused to pay, Chiron filed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two sides are in the infant stages of a legal dispute
that could take years to resolve. Blackburn said Chiron is
encouraged by a 1998 federal appellate decision in a similar case.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the courts ruled that CellPro Inc. infringed on a
patent granted to Johns Hopkins University. Both had developed
systems for sorting bone marrow cells for use in transplants. Both
relied on antigens to do sorting. Even though CellPro got its
product to market first and had its own patents on the process, the
courts ruled that Johns Hopkins had been first to patent the key
antigen and thus deserved royalties and damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal precedent is pretty clear from the CellPro case,''
Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   But the same case holds out a warning to Chiron. According to
Dale Hoscheit, a Washington, D.C., patent attorney who worked on
the CellPro matter, the case was originally tried before a jury
which decided in CellPro's favor, in part because CellPro took the
process to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juries can have good insights but they can be emotionally
swayed,'' Hoscheit said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ultimately set aside that jury verdict and ruled in
favor of Johns Hopkins. An appellate court upheld the finding.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Chiron prevails in its suit, there's no way to avoid
giving the impression that it is now banking on its lawyers to do
what its scientists couldn't, which is to create a money-making
anti-cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   WHO YA GONNA CALL? Genetic advances are pouring out of
laboratories faster than doctors and patients can comprehend. Many
ailments can now be diagnosed by genetic tests, but the people who
need them may not know where to get them. And if a test should
disclose that a patient has a rare genetic disease, that only
raises more questions about where to find information, treatment
and support.
</P>
<P>
   GeneSage is a San Francisco health care startup that hopes to
help health professionals navigate the new genetic terrain.
GeneSage has created a database on where to find genetic tests and
assembled a group of genetic counselors to provide consultations on
complex cases.
</P>
<P>
   The business is based on the solid proposition that most
questions about genetic disease will be fielded by general
practitioners whose training may not have equipped them to answer
these new questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most genetic medicine will and should be practiced by primary
care physicians,'' said GeneSage co-founder and genetic medicine
specialist, Paul Billings.
</P>
<P>
   While the premise seems sound, only time will tell whether the
price is right. GeneSage plans to sell subscriptions to medical
groups. An annual fee of roughly $120 per physician will entitle
all the doctors in the group to access the database, via the
Internet, to find out where to get genetic tests or how to
interpret the results. GeneSage will also arrange for follow-up
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   GeneSage won't say which, if any, medical groups or health plans
have bought into the service. There is a bit of free information
about genetic issues in general on the Web site at
 &LR; www.genesage.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SACRED CALF? The Coalition of Artists and Life Forms is a Bay
Area arts group that views biotechnology as both a subject and a
medium for creative expression. After a year or so of informal
meetings, CALF will hold its first public event Tuesday night,
``Art in the Age of Biotechnological Reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   On hand to discuss the aesthetics of cloning will be Lou
Hawthorne, who is running a $2.5 million effort to clone a dog;
Marilyn Donahue, an artist who advocates DNA copyrighting as a form
of protest against gene patents; Mark Brest Van Kempen, an
ecological artist who has created a small wetland that he can tow
on a trailer behind his car; and Sharon Grace, an interdisciplinary
artist and a founder of CALF.
</P>
<P>
   Radio personality Mal Sharpe and videographer Dale Hoyt will
moderate the discussion. The event begins at 8 p.m. at the Lab, an
alternative art gallery at 2948 16th St. in San Francisco.
Admission will be on a sliding scale from $5 to $8, a small price
to stand at the cutting edge of culture and bioscience. For more

 WEB SITES WOO ASIAN AMERICANS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Checking out Asian American Web sites isn't just
a hobby for Nelson Wong, it's ``a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco native figures he spends about 20 hours a week
surfing sites that are produced by or for the most wired ethnic
group in the United States: Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And on his own site, AArising.com, probably the oldest of them
all, Wong has posted links to some 2,500 sites. They range from
individual ``blogs'' _ a new Net contraction for personal e-zines,
or ``Web logs,'' that offer comment on everything from TV shows to
cars to love _ to the high-profile commercial venture aOnline.com,
which was recently launched by nationally known aMagazine.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Wong is the prime target for a new crop of
commercial sites like aOnline.com, Click2Asia.com,
AsianConnections.com, AsiaDera.com and Onna.com that are eyeing
profits in the diverse marketplace of Asians online.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, he says, nobody has hit the target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're trying to make money at it, they may be barking up
the wrong tree,'' said Wong, a 33-year-old Web designer who lives
and works in San Francisco. ``I don't see anything out there that's
a moneymaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Yang, founder and chief executive of aMagazine and
aOnline.com, hopes to change that. He knows commercial Asian
American sites that have come and gone, but he believes the time is
right for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting on something that is either going to be a gold
mine or a land mine,'' said Yang, who is moving the headquarters of
his 10-year-old company aMedia Inc. from New York to San Francisco
in August.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Asian Americans are the most wired
``community'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading Internet research firms, Forrester Research Inc. and
Jupiter Communications Inc., both say 69 percent of Asian American
households, about 2.2 million total, are online. According to
census estimates, there are about 11 million U.S. residents of
Asian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last week, Jupiter said the online
penetration of Asian American households should jump to 84 percent
by 2005. By comparison, about 54 percent of all Caucasian
households were online this year, a percentage that should jump to
76 percent in 2005, the Jupiter report said.
</P>
<P>
   And in an April report, Forrester Research said 61 percent of
Asian American households have made a purchase online, and in the
last quarter of 1999, they spent an average of $331 online. Latino
and Caucasian households spent $254 online during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, though, is that the term Asian American does not
refer to a singular entity, but a variety of people of various
ethnic backgrounds, cultures and interests from countries
throughout the Asia-Pacific Island and South Asia regions, such as
China, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian American community is probably the toughest to
target as a homogenous community because they are so diverse,''
said Ekaterina Walsh, a Forrester Research analyst who has followed
Asian American Web sites for several years.
</P>
<P>
   But Yang believes the time is right for a Web site that creates
more of an Asian American community. He believes his new
aOnline.com Asian American Digital Network, formally launched
earlier this month, will become a ``virtual hub'' for everything
from ``advertising to political organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go where Asian Americans are, and where we are is
the Internet,'' Yang said. ``Our goal is to create a consumer
market for Asian Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang's aMedia Inc., which is moving into a 20,000-square-foot
office at Market and Sixth streets, is hoping to build on the
success of its 10-year-old flagship aMagazine, a bimonthly
publication with about 200,000 subscribers that tracks culture and
politics in the various Asian American communities. The company has
also ventured into book publishing with titles ``I Am Jackie Chan:
My Life in Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang is cognizant that a number of Asian American portals have
tried and failed. A prime example is the defunct Channel A of Los
Altos, Calif., which started as a news and information site but
became a retail site to generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see why people would come back repeatedly and buy a
set of `Yan Can Cook Chopsticks,' '' said Yang, who hired Channel A
co-founder Steven Chin, a former San Francisco Examiner reporter,
as aOnline's Web development director.
</P>
<P>
   For aOnline.com, Yang hopes to draw readers by combining the
print magazine's content with original Web features on subjects
like imprisoned Los Alamos nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee or a report
on violence against Asian Americans on college campuses. The
company is beefing up its staff of editors, writers and
free-lancers from eight last year to nearly 40 this year, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, aOnline wants to become the hub in a network of Asian
American community groups by offering Web production services to
groups like the Organization of Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And aOnline hopes to increase its audience with entertainment,
especially with Internet music becoming one of the hottest
activities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yang said the company is negotiating to buy an independent
record label and plans to create a ``digital studio'' that will
spotlight Asian American artists and filmmakers through streaming
video and audio. That will be important as more consumers switch to
high-speed broadband Internet connections, both in the United
States and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia itself is not yet a consumer market for broadband media,
but within two years, Asia is going to be the single largest
Internet market in the world,'' Yang said. ``They'll need something
to fill those fat pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition among Asian American portals is already heating
up, each offering a potpourri of news, features and entertainment
to entice Asian and Asian American Web surfers, although only two
had sufficient traffic for Web research firm PC Data Online to
report.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' Click2Asia.com, for example, launched in August
armed with investors that include Gareth Chang, chairman of Asian
broadcaster StarTV. Along with wire service news from Asia, the
site last week offered Asian music videos, clips from a supermodel
contest and an interview with actress Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which has advertised on billboards, saw traffic jump
from 109,000 unique users in April to 376,000 in May, reaching
about 0.5 percent of the total number of Internet users, according
to PC Data Online.
</P>
<P>
   The other site, AsianAvenue.com, launched in 1997 in New York,
had 170,000 unique users in May, up from 111,000 the month before.
AsianConnections.com, of Newport Beach, offers articles by famed
former Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres and popular TV chef
Martin Yan. And last week, visitors would have found links to
exclusive video interviews with ``Mission: Impossible 2'' director
John Woo and ``Shanghai Noon'' star Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Some are targeting a narrow audience. Onna.com, a San Francisco
company that had a ``soft launch'' of its site in May, hopes to
attract an audience from the 6.4 million Japanese-speaking women
living in Japan who use the Web, said founder Hiroko Shimo.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose name translates to ``woman'' in Japanese,
decided to base operations locally because technology investors and
marketers who want to reach the target audience are here, Shimo
said.
</P>
<P>
   AsianScene.com Inc. of San Francisco, which says it has counted
about 700,000 unique users since its launch in August 1998, targets
``generation Y Asians of ages 15-25'' with information about
everything ``from car shows to parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Startup AsiaDera.com of Fremont, Calif., also wanted to target a
specific audience, the Filipino American market, said founder
Armand Cacacho.
</P>
<P>
   But Cacacho, whose main business is construction management,
said that in a time when big dot-coms are failing, he feels the
pressure from investors to show the site can generate money and not
just eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   So the site now sells toys, and Cacacho is working on deals with
real estate agents to list homes. AsiaDera.com also offers free
Internet access and long-distance Internet phone service and
features video from television networks in the Philippines, Hong
Kong, Singapore and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed,'' Cacacho said. ``If you don't have
sales, you don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forrester's Walsh said she so far has not seen anything to
indicate that Web sites targeting Asian Americans will make money.
She said aOnline might have a chance because, like African American
media company BET.com, it can leverage the drawing power of its
print publication.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, she said sites have to target a specific group
to succeed, and Walsh said even Onna.com's focus isn't narrow
enough. She said ethnic Web sites that are as narrowly focused as
one for 16-to-28-year-olds who like a certain type of music might
stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why there's more of an explosion of noncommercial
``blogs'' that deal with such topics as lifestyles, imported cars
and Asian American fashion models, said AArising's Wong, who adds
about eight to 10 new links every three days on his site, launched
in the now-ancient Web days of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find them much more compelling,'' Wong said. ``That's where
the biggest growth has been, but it's not necessarily where you're
going to make any money.''

 TECH 21: THESE FIRMS WANT YOUR COMPUTER  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One fun thing about this column is that if I
mention a problem or identify a need, and a solution is out there
or coming soon, odds are someone's going to bring it to my
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, noting the enormous amount of computing
horsepower now sitting on home and office PCs _ most of it lying
idle most of the day _ I lamented that there wasn't something more
compelling to do with this resource than look for extraterrestrials
or add digits to pi.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it turns out that I was by no means alone _ a slew of
top-tier technical types have had the same idea, and they're
already building new businesses around it. They're aiming to
support a wider range of nonprofit research projects, including
initiatives in health, biodiversity and environment modeling.
</P>
<P>
   But the new projects include commercial possibilities. The idea
is that companies in fields like animated movies, biotechnology and
drug research, or perhaps government agencies trying to match
fingerprints or predict the weather, might be willing to pay to
have their projects distributed across thousands or even millions
of PCs. After all, SETI &LR; home users, collectively, have already
contributed more than 300,000 years of computer time _ enough to be
compelling even to well-heeled pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one expects users to contribute their processing
time for commercial use without compensation. So the new
distributed-computing startups are looking at a variety of ways to
reward people for participating. Since cutting and mailing a check
for each user every month probably won't make sense because the
overhead would be prohibitive, they're considering other forms of
payment _ contributions to electronic wallets, discounts from
e-tailing partners or perhaps ISPs, maybe even frequent-flier
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Among these new companies, the farthest along appears to be a
San Francisco operation called Popular Power
( &LR; www.popularpower.com &LR; ). But there's also Distributed Science
( &LR; www.distributedscience.com &LR; ), which combines two earlier
projects, the commercial-oriented ProcessTree Network and a
nonprofit called DCypher.net. The combined operation is based in
Madison, Ala., outside Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   And today yet another startup, United Devices of Austin, Texas,
enters the field ( &LR; www.ud.com &LR; ). Its biggest claim to fame: Its
chief technical officer is David Anderson, organizer and director
of SETI(AT)home.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the stunning success of that project _ not at
finding intelligence elsewhere in the universe, but at
demonstrating the viability of what might be called massively
distributed computing _ Anderson's reputation and contacts are
powerful assets for the new company. I'm told he's known in some
circles as a ``geek rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   But the folks behind Popular Power are hardly slouches. Chief
executive Marc Hedlund used to run Lucasfilm's Internet division;
the chief technology officer, Nelson Minar, formerly worked on
distributed-computing applications at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   The group's angel investors include Brian Behlendorf, CTO and
founder of Collab.net and president of the Apache Software
Foundation (the open-source collaboration that produces the world's
most widely used Web server); Max Metral, CTO of PeoplePC and
former CTO of Firefly Networks; and several other CTOs and industry
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Power already has developed client software that, unlike
SETI(AT)home, is not hard-coded for one particular project; a beta
version for Windows is available now from the company's site, and
Mac and Linux versions are due soon. The initial Popular Power
project, to which you can start contributing today, is in the
nonprofit category: It involves simulating interactions among
influenza-virus variants and alternative vaccines and vaccination
strategies, to help scientists come up with the optimal vaccine for
next year's flu season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Popular Power hasn't launched any commercial projects,
its software will let users choose to devote their machine entirely
to nonprofit projects or to commercial work, or to split it in
various proportions. Eventually, we'll probably be able to choose
specific projects from a menu of alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for compensating participants aren't settled yet, but
Hedlund said a user who makes a relatively up-to-date PC available
12 hours a day might earn $5 to $15 a month. At least for now,
Popular Power's screen-saver graphics aren't as spiffy as
SETI(AT)home's, but the chance to contribute to a constructive,
this-worldly cause and/or make a few bucks, might be enough to
overcome that disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   United Devices is even further from finalizing its payment
plans, but one idea that has garnered a lot of interest in its
focus groups, according to CEO Ed Hubbard, is giving contributors
virtual sweepstakes tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, who worked at Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. before a
recent stint at Dell Computer Corp., also hopes for advertising
support: SETI(AT)home users, it turns out, love to study the
comparative performance data that the project posts at its site,
and Hubbard thinks so many United Devices users will eventually do
the same that computer-makers and others will happily pay to
advertise on the UD site.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the compensation issues, these companies have some
serious technical challenges that SETI(AT)home hasn't had to face.
For commercial jobs, there's the problem of security _ customers
aren't going to be interested in distributing their projects to
unknown PC users around the world unless they're convinced their
data is safe from hackers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Execs at the distributed-computing startups, however, are well
aware of this issue, and they tell me they'll have solutions that
should set potential clients' minds at rest.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, it appears that our collective gigaflops will
be doing a little more for the world than they are today _ and
maybe even helping us pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD NEWS ON THE WIRELESS FRONT: Readers interested in building
a wireless local area network around the house or office _ so you
can surf the Web from your couch or a conference room _ will be
happy to hear that prices for gear based on the hot new 802.11b
standard are coming down.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, we're about to see a breakthrough in pricing for
PC-friendly base stations. These contraptions, also known as
network access points, serve as the hub for a wireless LAN and
connect it to the Internet either by modem or, via Ethernet,
through a DSL, cable or other high-speed link.
</P>
<P>
   A regular desktop PC with a wired connection and an 802.11b PCI
or ISA card installed can serve the same function, but a separate
base station has a big advantage: It means you can get online from
a wireless-equipped notebook at any time without having to leave
your desktop PC running constantly.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall from my last column on the subject, most
802.11b base stations cost more than $1,000; no PC-oriented
networking company came close to Apple's $299 price for its
flying-saucer-shaped AirPort Base Station. Although it is possible
to get PC notebooks online through the AirPort product, setting up
this configuration is a little too complicated for non-geek tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Lucent Technologies Inc. has started shipping its
802.11b base station, dubbed the Orinoco Residential Gateway, and
pricing isn't too bad: list for a complete, functioning unit plus
an extra card for a notebook is $449.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other companies are now hard at work on even less
expensive equivalents. Next month, for example, Linksys, a leading
provider of networking equipment for home and small-business users,
plans to announce an 802.11b base station priced at just $249,
along with a $99 wireless PC Card, a $119 PCI version and a $119
external USB adapter. They'll all be marketed as part of the
Linksys OnAirWireless series.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't yet tested the products myself, but the specs look
good _ they include an encryption option, and Linksys says they'll
be compliant with Wi-Fi, the emerging standard that's supposed to
ensure compatibility among 802.11b products from various vendors.
</P>
<P>
   802.11b, remember, is a local-area-networking technology, not a
wide-area one. It's more like a cordless phone that works around
the house than a cell phone you can, theoretically, use almost
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But with prices for 802.11b equipment tumbling and compatibility
hopefully improving, this distinction could soon be blurred, as
numerous companies are planning to install access points in
airports, hotels and other public spaces. When that happens, you
should be able to get online at such locations just by walking into
range with an 802.11b-equipped notebook.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans with such cards can get a taste of this wireless
future by taking their notebooks over to the Presidio, where a
group called SFLan, instigated by Brewster Kahle, a well-known
Internet entrepreneur, has already installed several 802.11b public
access points. Details are available at  &LR; www.sflan.com &LR; .

17TH MAN ARRESTED IN CENTRAL PARK SEX ATTACKS
</HEADLINE>
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police on Sunday arrested the 17th man suspected
of participating in attacks against women in Central Park after the
National Puerto Rican Day Parade June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Lonnie Hopson, was arrested at his home in Queens
about 1 a.m. Sunday. He was charged with one count of first-degree
sexual abuse, a felony, and one count of first-degree riot. He's
being held pending arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Detective George Nagy, a police spokesman, said Hopson was
recorded on amateur videotape among the frenzied crush of men who
abused dozens of women in the southeastern corner of the park on
June 11. He was arrested without incident, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all of those arrested so far, police said, Hopson,
18, does not have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The police said detectives were led to Hopson by an anonymous
caller who saw his picture published in newspapers and broadcast on
television. The figure in the picture was distinctive. In it, the
suspect wears a football jersey bearing the number 20 and a thick
gold chain and has his hair braided in wide cornrows.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities would not say what role they believed Hopson
played in the attacks, saying that more details would emerge when
he was arraigned.
</P>
<P>
   The police have released photographs of 20 other men wanted for
their roles in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In successive news conferences Sunday, members of 100 Blacks in
Law Enforcement Who Care, the Rev. Al Sharpton and the National
Organization for Women appeared near the intersection of Central
Park South and the Avenue of the Americas, where the attacks
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton arrived with two women, Ashanna Cover and Josina
Lawrence, who have filed lawsuits against the city. They stood by
the street lamp where the two women say they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women have returned to the scene of the crime,''
Sharpton said. ``Today is Father's Day. We will hope that all
fathers take a stand against this reckless, misogynist behavior and
do what is necessary to restore a sense of security and respect to
our daughters in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also said he would lead all-male rallies starting next
Saturday, beginning with a rally in Harlem and then moving on from
borough to borough. ``We need to really deal with the fact that
some young men feel it is appropriate and even fun to do what
happened in the park last weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, roughly 200 demonstrators arrived at the
intersection and began a march to the Central Park precinct of the
New York Police to protest the department's handling of the
attacks.

ISMAIL MAHOMED, 68; LED POST-APARTHEID COURT
</HEADLINE>
  By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Chief Justice Ismail Mahomed, a
lifelong champion of the fight against white rule and the first
person of color to preside over South Africa's highest common-law
court, died here on Saturday night. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomed, had been in and out of the hospital since learning
earlier this year that he had pancreatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He left the bench a few months ago, said the Justice Ministry's
chief spokesman, Paul Setsetse.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomed's death, in the Linksfield Park Clinic, was, Setsetse
said, ``the result of the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice was buried Sunday in the capital, Pretoria,
after a funeral service that was attended by President Thabo Mbeki
and members of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomed lived in Johannesburg with his wife, Hawo.
</P>
<P>
   His death leaves the Supreme Court of Appeal leaderless at a
crucial time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Indian shopkeepers, he studied law at the University
of the Witwatersrand, one of the country's best schools. But he
found his ambitions stunted by the apartheid era's entrenched
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   He was denied admission to the bar in Pretoria, where he had
grown up. He managed to win admission in Johannesburg in the late
1950s, but found himself hemmed in by the intricate web of laws
that had been crafted to curtail the freedoms of people considered
nonwhite under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the notorious Group Areas Act, he was barred from renting
an office of his own, so he would use colleagues' offices when they
were in court or failing that, head off to the law library.
</P>
<P>
   Far from succumbing to its restrictions, however, he became one
of the country's leading authorities on that law. It restricted
where persons considered nonwhite were permitted to be and was a
major targets of the anti-apartheid activists whom Mahomed would
spend decades defending.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, in spite of everything that stood in the way of
his success, he became known as one of the bar's sharpest minds and
engaging orators, not only in South Africa but across the region as
well. After winning independence from South Africa, neighboring
Namibia called on him to help draft its constitution and selected
him to be the country's chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   When South Africa began to take its first steps toward change in
the early 1990s, Mahomed was appointed a judge, the first nonwhite
to sit on the bench in South Africa's history. And in 1996, Nelson
Mandela, who had been elected president in 1994 in the country's
first all-race elections, chose Mahomed as chairman of the Supreme
Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While his appointment was a momentous step toward transforming
the country's justice system, in the years since then, the court
has made no progress in adding more people of color to the roster
of 18 justices who sit on its bench.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of the other permanent justices is a white man, many
of them veterans of the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   For months, pressure has been mounting on the government to take
steps to recast the court with a bench that is more reflective of
the nation's population. With the loss of Mahomed, those calls are
likely to grow louder.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Owners of the Branson Scenic Railway have
expressed interest in starting and operating commuter rail service
in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is still very preliminary, the rail
service would reach from Grandview to Union Station and then to
Olathe, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty confident about our proposal,'' said Saul Kass,
one of the owners of the Branson tourist railroad. ``The key thing
now is to know whether we will get enough riders to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal must overcome serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
   First, the railroad needs a ridership survey to judge local
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the railroad has yet to discuss its plans with the
railroads that own the tracks a commuter line would share with
freight traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of other railroads say they are open to the idea, but
they are concerned about the capacity of their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to comment without having seen anything,'' said
Steve Forsberg, general director of public affairs for Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Railroad, which owns the tracks that parallel
Interstate 35 in Johnson County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular line is the line that is already extremely
crowded with freight traffic,'' Forsberg said. ``Besides, Johnson
County is already talking to us about using it for their commuter
rail service.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with Kansas City Southern Railway said that although
the company was aware of the interest in commuter rail, there had
not been a formal presentation. The railroad owns the tracks that
run from about Grandview north to the Missouri River, along
Interstate 435.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saul mentioned this to me, in vague terms in passing,'' said
Warren Erdman, vice president of corporate affairs for Kansas City
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that we certainly would be open-minded to his
ideas, but it takes time to work out the capacity problems,''
Erdman said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge might be getting commuter rail service
started and operating it using only private funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Carnaggio, director of engineering for the Federal Transit
Administration, said it was rare for someone to start commuter rail
service using only private funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes a sizable investment,'' Carnaggio said. ``To
be honest with you, it is very difficult to get your return on
investment. I would say what they are proposing is very unusual and
somewhat ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg put it bluntly: ``Commuter rail just doesn't make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kass disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1993, Branson Scenic Railway has taken tourists on
40-mile excursions out of Branson. Last year the railroad carried
more than 90,000 passengers, and it expects to carry more than
100,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kass said the company hoped to translate its success into a
commuter line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what it takes to run a profitable system.''
</P>
<P>
   Under their commuter rail proposal, Branson Scenic Railway would
form a new company. The new company, said Tom Johnson, president of
the Branson Railway, would lease several engines and buy used
passenger cars and refurbish them.
</P>
<P>
   Kass said they faced a tight deadline. They have to get the
passenger cars now, before they are sold to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars we originally wanted to buy have been sold,'' Kass
said. ``We know of eight other cars, and we can purchase them for a
good price. But we need to make the decision soon, or Kansas City
can just forget about commuter rail.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Kass said, the new company would spend less than $1.5
million in start-up costs to get commuter rail service in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, about $30 million, most of it from federal money,
has been allocated for Johnson County's commuter rail project.
</P>
<P>
   Kass' company, however, would rely on the railroads that own the
tracks to make improvements to accommodate commuter service. These
costs would be recouped through long-term lease arrangements with
the new commuter rail service.
</P>
<P>
   Kass and Johnson said the lease payments would be paid through
passenger fares.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did not know how much fares would be but said
costs would be comparable to what people paid for parking, gas and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands now, the homework has not been done,'' Erdman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they developed a meaningful, serious proposal, we would
take a look at what it would take to improve the capacity to ensure
the safety on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Erdman said, Kansas City Southern probably would prefer a
more regional look into commuter rail for the Kansas City area, one
that would take into consideration how other public transit modes
would work together.
</P>
<P>
   Mell Henderson, director of transportation for the Mid-America
Regional Council, said the metropolitan planning agency was
embarking on a regional commuter rail study that would identify
which rail corridors held potential for passenger service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is more complicated than just saying, `There are
rails out there; let's go put commuter rail on them,' &UR; '' Henderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Henderson said, Kass and Johnson's proposed commute rail
project was consistent with ideas others had expressed the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not coming completely out of the blue,'' Henderson
said. ``But there are other questions that need to be looked at and
get answered before moving forward on what they are suggesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg said Burlington Northern Santa Fe might not be
interested in working with the owners of the Branson Scenic Railway
without first consulting with Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are in the position where we are trying to
invite a bidding war of any kind,'' Forsberg said. ``Johnson
County's willingness to look at this will have a lot of impact on
our view as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County is doing preliminary engineering on the I-35
commuter rail project. That work is expected to give the county a
true look at the potential of the project.
</P>
<P>
   If feasible, those commuter trains would likely start running in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Kass says his trains could be running as early as the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Ferguson, commuter rail project director for Johnson
County Transit, said he did not see this as a competition to be the
first provider of commuter rail service. He said that if Kass was
successful, the county probably would drop its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not parochial here,'' Ferguson said. ``If somebody has
a better idea, we will stop and look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Johnson County will continue with its commuter rail
project, Ferguson said. The county would probably hire a firm to
operate its system.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kass and Johnson do not proceed with their own plans,
Ferguson said, Johnson County probably would see whether they had
interest in operating Johnson County's commuter rail service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they have been very successful with Branson Scenic
Railway, and obviously they know how to operate a passenger
train,'' Ferguson said. ``They are certainly positioning themselves
to be a player in the future.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: MYSTERY ALLURE OF `IRON CHEF' ONLY ADDS TO
EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to understand how the premiere of ``Survivor'' on CBS
last month drew 16 million viewers and became one of the network's
greatest successes. The show, about a group of strangers pitted
against one another on an island in the South China Sea while
television cameras looked on, was almost impossible to avoid, with
a TV Guide cover, articles in numerous newspapers and a barrage of
on-air promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Far more unusual, however, has been the success of an obscure
Japanese cooking show called ``Iron Chef,'' which is emerging as
the newest cult hit on television. Since its introduction on the
Food Network last summer, it has become that cable channel's
second-highest-rated show after ``Emeril Live!''
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic illustration of what network people call
``appointment viewing'': shows people actually make plans to watch,
instead of watching by chance or because they're too lazy to change
channels. But it's also an example of something new: the way cable
television, the Internet and old-fashioned word of mouth can
combine to propel quirky phenomena into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Even Julia Child has expressed her delight with the show (in the
current issue of Gourmet). But the appeal of ``Iron Chef'' extends
well beyond food enthusiasts. Julie Yaeger, a 31-year-old vice
president for publicity at Miramax (who says she is ``into the
ordering in and eating out phase'' of life), for example, was
channel-surfing when she was stopped by the ``Iron Chef.'' That was
last September. Since then, she and her boyfriend, the actor Paul
Rudd, and a group of friends frequently get together Friday nights
to watch the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iron Chef'' is a rococo blend of highbrow and low, of culinary
artistry and wrestling-match vulgarity, of fantasy and practicality
(though there are no recipes). What captures and holds viewers like
Yaeger is the show's combination of kitsch and craft and the way it
cloaks earnest competition and serious cooking in the goofiest
trappings, including English dubbing that seems modeled on the
exclamatory rhythms of kung-fu movie translations.
</P>
<P>
   The show combines Japanese formalism with American-style
showmanship to create a hybrid that is the equivalent of a Pokemon
for grown-ups. There is, clearly, a universal appeal in these timed
contests between supremely skilled artisans who chop flesh and
fruit with speed and ferocity, and with very big knives.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, a chef challenger comes to the show to try to defeat
one of the regulars, a Cooking Iron Man. (On Sunday, in a special
edition taped in New York, Bobby Flay, chef of Mesa Grill and Bolo
_ and a Food Network star himself _ will be the challenger.)
Moments before the cooking contest begins, each chef is given a
single ``theme ingredient,'' which must be the centerpiece of every
course in a multicourse meal. The ingredients can be as pedestrian
as a potato, as exotic as bird's nest and oat yam.
</P>
<P>
   The cooks, with a supporting cast of assistants, have one hour
to finish. Dishes are prepared in a real-time frenzy. Beautiful and
sometimes bizarre creations (sturgeon-head ice cream and frog-fish
creme brulee) emerge from this on-the-spot creation of a menu. A
panel of four judges tastes, comments and declares the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The show always opens with a quotation from Brillat-Savarin, the
18th-century French gourmet and philosopher, which appears on the
screen: ``Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.''
Then a narrator briefly recounts the tale of Takeshi Kaga, a
wealthy man with a fantasy ``to encounter new and original
cuisines, which could be called true artistic creations.''
</P>
<P>
   We see the slender Kaga, who dresses like Liberace, sampling
food and surveying the scene. The opening ritual continues as Kaga
chooses a yellow pepper from a pile of peppers, bites into it and
smiles mysteriously. ``Iron Chef'' aficionados debate whether his
smile is ironic or not. Is it a smile or, in fact, a smirk?
</P>
<P>
   The camera pans across the Kitchen Stadium, a studio with
red-draped backdrops and torch-lit runways. Portentous music
throbs, as the four Iron Chefs come rising out of the stage like
fountains in front of a Las Vegas hotel. The narrator introduces
the challenger chefs and video clips of their restaurants, shot in
the homespun style of a local commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Kaga unveils the ingredient of the week, sounds the Gong of
Fate, and the culinary samurai prepare to do battle. The
commentators, former Japanese sports announcers, have transported
the play-by-play patter of the sports arena to the kitchen. ``Look
at this, check it out,'' one of them pants during one session
featuring pork bellies.
</P>
<P>
   Though challengers do receive free advertisements for their
restaurants, their real reward is honor. There is no cash prize.
The show's resident Iron Chefs aren't unseated, even if they're
defeated. So it doesn't diminish the fun to discover that host Kaga
is an actor (who has played Jean Valjean in ``Les Miserables'' and
Jesus in ``Jesus Christ Superstar''), and that chefs are informed
in advance of possible ingredients that may be selected for the
battle. The show's purity transcends its fakery.

 UNDATED: transcends its fakery. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From 1993 through 1999 ``Iron Chef'' was one of Japan's most
popular shows. It became an underground favorite in Los Angeles and
San Francisco three years ago, when local cable stations broadcast
it during Japanese-language programming blocks. Web sites
proliferated, in English and Japanese. Food Network bought ``Iron
Chef,'' which its producer, Fuji Television Network, had translated
into English, but wasn't prepared for the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first took a look at the show, I was immediately
captured by the humor, and my culinary staff was transfixed as well
by the food information,'' says Eileen Opatut, the network's head
of programming, who is nevertheless astonished by the show's
popularity. Nielsen Media Research reports that about 222,000
people watched each ``Iron Chef'' episode in May, more than the
131,000 viewers seven months earlier. These numbers are tiny by
network standards but impressive in the world of cable, which
reaches many fewer homes and operates with much smaller programming
and marketing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to explain why some shows cross the line.
``Antiques Road Show'' _ which tours the country and features
experts who appraise viewers' antiques _ has become the top-rated
program on PBS, with a regular audience of almost 14 million fans.
``The Crocodile Hunter'' on Animal Planet is about to spawn its own
toy line. ``Iron Chef'' isn't yet in that league: no dolls wearing
chef's hats are due any time soon. Even so, its success is
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Television Network, which produced the original 290
episodes of ``Iron Chef,'' spared no expense on food ingredients.
The company spent $7.7 million on exotica like matsutake _ a
Japanese mushroom that cost around $300 an ounce _ and electric eel
and lobster (used by one chef to flavor an asparagus dish, which
required the lobster to be discarded after its essence was
extracted).
</P>
<P>
   ``The show seems associated with the years of the economic
bubble, and the absurd extravagances of the late '80s,'' said
Jordan Sand, who teaches Japanese history and culture at Georgetown
University and who discovered ``Iron Chef'' when he was living in
Japan in 1994. ``Since it ran in the post-bubble years, it must be
parodic. It was more funny because the dream was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not ``Iron Chef'' signaled a cultural response to
economic stimuli, the elaborate machinations of the chefs
undoubtedly harken to a particularly Japanese kind of food
fetishism. ``Iron Chef'' follows the tradition of Ajikko, the main
character of a Japanese cartoon series shown in the 1980s about a
boy who traveled around the country challenging chefs to culinary
battles. And remember ``Tampopo,'' the 1987 Japanese comedy, in
which all of life boiled down to the perfect bowl of noodles?
</P>
<P>
   In the United States the word has spread in many ways. Paul
Witcover's girlfriend forced him to watch the show the first time
and then he was hooked. They've broken up, but each remains
faithful to ``Iron Chef.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the cooks, the effort and the passion they put into
their work; that cannot be faked,'' said Witcover, 41, who writes
science fiction. ``Did you see the first woman chef?'' he asked.
``She slices her hand open and the blood is flowing. There are no
doctors on hand so, they take masking tape and tape her hand, and
she continues to cook. The samurai aspect rose to the core with
this woman who wounds herself and battles on.''
</P>
<P>
   Witcover introduced the show to Dan Von Behren, who works for a
computer software company. ``Now I have hundreds of people who can
pontificate about the beauty of the `Iron Chef,''' he said. On
Thanksgiving he and three friends, from different cities, convened
to have their own ``Iron Chef'' cook-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch NYPD Blue,'' Behren said. ``I watch West Wing. I love
the Simpsons.'' Still, what attracts him to ``Iron Chef'' is a bit
of a mystery to him. ``I don't know how to describe it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how to cook, or wanting to cook, or being a grown-up, is
not a prerequisite. Sam Tobis, a 10-year-old fifth-grader in
Manhattan, took a look at the show after overhearing friends of his
parents talking about it. He was mesmerized by the sight of a chef
frying the scales of sea bass and then serving them with chocolate
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the skill mixed with the rarity of everything that's
going on,'' he said, offering a persuasive argument for the show's
attraction. ``It's so 21st century. Everything is weird and
different.''

OZ INVESTOR PLANS TO TRIPLE HIS STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Michigan-based marketing company and its
chairman own 26 percent of the Oz Entertainment Co., and the
executive plans to almost triple his investment in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   As Oz Entertainment proposes to clean up environmental
contamination at the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant in Johnson
County, Kan., and build an $860.6 million theme park resort there,
public interest in the company's investors has swelled.
</P>
<P>
   Oz Chairman Robert Kory is often asked about whose money is
behind Oz.
</P>
<P>
   In large part the answer is 75-year-old Steve Toth Jr. and his
company.
</P>
<P>
   Toth owns 83 percent of VSI Holdings, a marketing company near
Detroit that hopes to tap Oz's potential for Internet education and
entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   VSI is publicly traded and has 390 shareholders of record. The
stock closed Friday at 2 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, VSI Holdings and Toth's family trust have invested
$12.4 million in Oz and its investment arm, K.C. Investors LP. Of
that, $7.9 million came from the Toth family.
</P>
<P>
   The total investment gives Toth and VSI a 26 percent stake in Oz
and makes them Oz's largest investor.
</P>
<P>
   VSI representatives hold two of five seats on the Oz
Entertainment Co.'s board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the game,'' Toth said. ``That's not a huge amount (of
money), but it's still a lot to put in a good-faith venture, which
is what we've done with the state. It's very important it moves
along in the direction it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Toth, through his family trust, plans to invest $15 million to
$20 million more to help Oz close on the Sunflower land near De
Soto. Such expenses include paying closing costs and about $11.5
million to buy insurance to guarantee the Sunflower cleanup, said
Tom Marquis, VSI's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Toth's share of the company will grow with the investment, but
not enough to control Oz, Kory and Marquis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kory and VSI expect to raise an additional $70 million when Oz
closes the land deal, Marquis said.
</P>
<P>
   That round of fund raising will dilute Toth's share of the
company, Marquis and Kory said.
</P>
<P>
   VSI enjoys a strategic partnership with Oz: VSI invests in Oz
and gets the contracts for marketing the theme park's opening and
creating the 3-D animatronic characters for the theme park, said Jo
Bourjaily, who handles new business development for VSI.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the investment, VSI executives meet regularly with
Kory and often send representatives to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching carefully what happens in Kansas,'' Bourjaily
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oz does not have key approvals for its project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board doesn't feel this is any more at risk than any
investment we've made,'' Marquis said. ``To the contrary, we feel
it probably will have a higher payoff than other investments.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVern Krueger, an associate professor at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City's Bloch School of Business and Public
Administration, said: ``This is a vehicle put together for the Toth
interests. It's not the normal corporate business you'd think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger reviewed VSI's public financial filings at the request
of The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gamble,'' Krueger said. ``But he's not really
answerable to (many) stockholders for that gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   An Oz critic said VSI's involvement did not improve his opinion
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious where Oz stands on the totem pole of investors
when it has to find unrelated, unknown, small-company financing and
then turn around and brag about it like it's a big deal,'' said
Bill Sheldon, president of Taxpayers Opposed To Oz. ``This further
brings in unknown people and unknown circumstances, which the
public and the government is supposed to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Oz and public officials call the project a public-private
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Oz would clean up the Sunflower site in exchange for acquiring
the land, and the state would issue bonds to finance part of the
construction cost for the theme park.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds would be repaid with sales tax revenue generated by
the park. The state would not be responsible for repaying the bonds
if the venture failed.
</P>
<P>
   Oz also seeks property tax breaks for the site.
</P>
<P>
   Toth's marketing company began in the early 1960s as Visual
Services Inc. Visual Services went public in 1997 by merging with a
publicly traded company called the Banker's Note, operated by
Toth's nephew. The Banker's Note was later spun off.
</P>
<P>
   The result was VSI Holdings, a 1,200-employee company that had
about $145 million in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   VSI does an array of marketing work, such as conducting
high-tech training for sales people, helping to launch new products
and developing e-commerce Web sites. About 90 percent of VSI's
marketing revenue comes from the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   An entertainment arm of VSI creates 3-D animatronic, or
robotlike, characters for theme parks, including Universal Studios.
It also uses the technology for education, such as a
drunken-driving simulator sent to high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kory and Toth said VSI's missions dovetailed with the Oz plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a company that understands marketing and event
marketing that's necessary for a theme park launch and understands
the theme park industry is a unique combination of talent,'' said
Kory. ``And they have a passion for the Web and a serious
understanding of the future of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Oz executives said the theme park would be digitally networked
to draw upon Internet possibilities _ such as a virtual park,
interactive games and other entertainment spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a key reason for us to be involved in Oz,'' Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   Toth's company also is creating a Web site development business
with Oz.
</P>
<P>
   VSI is about to invest $200,000 to $250,000 in e-City Studios, a
division of Oz that creates Web sites for businesses other than Oz,
Marquis said.
</P>
<P>
   E-City Studios would become a separate entity, and VSI would own
70 percent, Marquis said. VSI expects e-City Studios to bill $5
million to $6 million in work the first year.
</P>
<P>
   While VSI has dabbled in Web development, it has not been a key
company business, Marquis said. The partnership with Oz's e-City
Studios allows VSI to expand and gives clients a new respect for
the company's Web abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Other business opportunities down the road include a possible
training center on the Sunflower land, Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to dream a little bit, this is just the beginning
of it.''

   If it's going to be anything more than just a curiosity for
late-night, tipsy channel surfers, a niche cable network needs an
offbeat hit.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a concept that works itself all the way to the
big screen - remember the Sci-Fi Channel's ``Mystery Science
Theater 3000`?
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it's a bunch of Japanese guys running around
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one way of describing ``Iron Chef,'' the Food Network's
bizarre Japanese import that combines the hilarity of badly dubbed
dialogue with the silliness of competitive cooking.
</P>
<P>
   `Good, solid, goofy fun` is another, one that Eileen Opatut,
senior vice president for programming for the Food Network, likes
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither description quite gets it done. To its fans, the
show is so much ... more. What makes it so oddly addictive is hard
to describe to anyone who hasn't seen it.
</P>
<P>
   `You can imagine what it was like presenting it to my senior
managers,` Opatut says.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a universe of hundreds of TV channels, ``Iron Chef'' is
unique. And it'd better be.
</P>
<P>
   `I think every cable channel, just because of the inherent level
of competition ... needs something that stands out, that sets it
out from the rest of the pack,` Opatut says.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Iron Chef,'' the Food Network certainly has that.
</P>
<P>
   The production comes to the United States next Sunday for a
one-time competition, called, in typical ``Iron Chef'' hyperbole,
`New York Battle.` It's fun, but don't be fooled; the regular show
is better.
</P>
<P>
   Each episode begins with a professional chef challenging one of
the `Iron Chefs,` four guys decked out in loud costumes that make
them look as if they got lost on the way to Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   Once the competitors are set, the secret ingredient is revealed,
rising from the floor in a swirl of dry ice, and the two chefs have
one hour to put together a multicourse meal based on it. (The
ingredients range from the sublime - crabs, say - to the
ridiculous. Unless you're a big ostrich egg fan.)
</P>
<P>
   For much of the next hour, we watch the chefs perform all sorts
of culinary wizardry, accompanied by oddly dubbed play-by-play and
color commentary so passionately over the top it makes John Madden
sound like Stephen Wright in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   When time runs out, a panel of judges puts the food's taste to
the test, gobbling it down and describing each dish in the glowing
terms you usually hear only when the white-haired lady in front of
you in the grocery store line talks about her new grandson. Mind
you, these are invariably dishes so authentic - which is to say,
repulsive to American palates - that most of us couldn't imagine
putting them anywhere near our mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the winner is announced; if you bet on the ``Iron Chef''
every time, you'd never go broke.
</P>
<P>
   All this takes place in Kitchen Stadium, in front of a
hooting-and-hollering throng that would do any self-respecting
soccer hooligan proud.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner gets? Nothing, really.
</P>
<P>
   `They're fighting for honor and stature,` Opatut says. `You're
fighting for the valor and the glory of it.... You're not just
winning a brand new car.`
</P>
<P>
   Which is why ``Iron Chef'' is likely to remain what it is: a fun
Japanese import. It simply wouldn't work remade as an American
show, `New York Battle` notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   `I think we might just ruin it,` Opatut says.
</P>
<P>
   Why mess with success? ``Iron Chef'' bounces between being the
second- and third-highest-rated show on the Food Network (nothing
beats Emeril Lagasse - just ask him).
</P>
<P>
   `Who would know that a cooking show, a cooking competition that
looks more like Gladiators than it does a PBS cooking show, would
end up being a hit,` Opatut says.
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense, however. In a weird way, watching ``Iron Chef'' is
no different from watching a football game: It allows you a finite
amount of time to get caught up in something that is, in the big
scheme of things, completely unimportant. In other words, it's a
nice break from everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   `At the end of it, it's not going to decide the future of the
planet,` Opatut says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's not. But for an hour, it sure is fun to pretend
it will. &QL;

RED-LIGHT RUNNERS BEWARE: CAMERAS TO CATCH YOU ARE COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Surveillance cameras have become part of
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Withdraw money from the bank? There's a camera. Gamble at a
casino? There's a camera. Buy cigarettes at the convenience store?
There's a camera. Shop for clothes? Chances are there's a camera.
</P>
<P>
   And soon there may be cameras watching you when you drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Department of Transportation has selected Overland
Park as the site of a yearlong program to test the use of cameras
to catch drivers who run red lights. Overland Park is the only city
in Kansas chosen for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Overland Park will not issue tickets based on
pictures from the cameras. The program is a prelude to a highway
department request for legislative approval to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are looking at placing cameras at three Overland
Park locations: 119th Street and Hawthorne Plaza; Metcalf Avenue
and Interstate 435; and 95th Street and Quivira Road. Those
locations are not set, however.
</P>
<P>
   Red-light runners are blamed for 260,000 crashes nationwide each
year, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,
based in Arlington, Va. About 750 of those crashes involve
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Overall the number of crashes is on the rise. Fatal intersection
collisions increased 16 percent between 1992 and 1998. All other
crashes increased 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Police and traffic-safety activists say that camera enforcement
will deter red-light runners and cut the number of accidents at
intersections. The Federal Highway Administration claims that the
presence of cameras will reduce red-light violations 20 percent to
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People run red lights because they think they can get away
with it, and they don't want to sit and wait for the light,'' said
Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the highway safety institute.
``For the most part it's a deliberate act.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the cameras smack of an Orwellian nightmare, and
some civil libertarians are concerned that the cameras threaten the
right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you know from the camera for sure is that it was the
automobile that was in violation of the ordinance,'' said Dick
Kurtenbach, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Kansas and Western Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have no clue based on the license who is driving
the vehicle. You're going to have to have an alibi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland lawyer is suing the city of Baltimore over a $76
ticket he received March 6. Among other things, Imad K. Dajani
charges the city with violating his constitutional right to due
process. He contends that the law presumes the driver is guilty
without requiring the city to prove a violation occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts are skeptical about those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe Howard, a University of Kansas law professor, said the
courts tended to give government some latitude when public safety
was at stake. For instance, Howard pointed to court rulings that
allowed police to stop suspicious persons on the street without
probable cause as long as they could articulate a reason for making
the stop.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Howard said, it would be reasonable for a court to
allow cities to convict a red-light violator by merely identifying
the car through its license plate and registration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Kansas City made a push to use cameras _ also known as
photo radar _ to crack down on speeders. The proposal died after
Jackson County circuit judges said the plan, essentially, would
require vehicle owners to prove their innocence instead of forcing
the city to prove guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras can be mounted to shoot either the front or back of
moving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras have been used to enforce traffic laws in Canada and
Europe for nearly 30 years. In the United States at least 50 cities
in 12 states have some kind of red-light camera enforcement. Those
cities include Washington, D.C.; Sacramento, Calif.; San Diego;
Boulder, Colo.; and Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Kansas and Missouri say they do not know of a
city in either state that uses cameras to enforce red lights. They
say that legislation would be required in either state to allow
cities to use red-light cameras and issue tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A bill was introduced two years ago in the Missouri General
Assembly to allow cities to install cameras to enforce traffic
signals. The bill died, in part out of fear of unwarranted
government intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't want to have cameras following them and keeping
track of their whereabouts, even though that wasn't our intent,''
said the bill's sponsor, state Rep. Don Kissell, a Democrat from
St. Peters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never our intent to convict people. Our intent was to
tell people our intersections are being monitored, so don't violate
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was introduced in the Nebraska Legislature last
year but was not approved, because of concerns about due process.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, particularly those in California and Arizona, hold
the driver of the vehicle responsible for the traffic violation.
</P>
<P>
   In those states pictures are taken of the driver and the license
plate. The violation is recorded on the driver's record and turned
over to insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities, such as Baltimore and Charlotte, N.C., handle the
citation like a parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A photo is taken only of the license plate. Car owners are held
responsible for paying the fine, although they can ask authorities
to assign responsibility to the driver. No penalty is assessed
against the car owner's driving record.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that automated traffic-signal enforcement has
helped reduce accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, for example, accidents were reduced by about 41
percent at six intersections where cameras were installed in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore started out with six cameras. It now has 18 and plans
to go to 48 by next year. From February 1999 through the end of
May, 75,637 drivers had been ticketed by the cameras for running
red lights.
</P>
<P>
   The city has raised about $2.4 million in fines, not counting
the part of the fine that goes to Lockheed Martin IMS for setting
up the program and helping administer it.
</P>
<P>
   Intersection crashes also were reduced in Charlotte after 20
cameras were installed in August 1998. To date, about 63,000
tickets have been issued for red-light runners since the program
started.
</P>
<P>
   The number of all crashes at Charlotte intersections dropped to
627 from 686 in the first year the cameras were in operation. The
number of accidents in Charlotte caused by drivers running red
lights dropped to 276 from 342 in the first year cameras were in
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note that the cameras are moneymakers for cities. One
target for criticism has been Washington, where officials were
expecting to make an additional $16 million in fines this year and
$14.5 million in future years.
</P>
<P>
   One camera among the 37 posted in Washington attracted press
attention in May when it was reported it was generating $10,000 a
day in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported that the camera, described by some
drivers as an ambush camera, billed $1.5 million in fines over six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Police later acknowledged that the camera was unfair and stopped
using it to issue fines.

TIGER IS UNBEATABLE AT PEBBLE BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH - Hagen, Hogan, Nicklaus ... and Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods strode the famed fairways of Pebble Beach Golf Links
into history Sunday, tying the U.S. Open record of 272 with a
final-round 67 that earned him a record 15-stroke victory in the
100th national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods missed just four of 14 fairways, hit 15 greens in
regulation and rolled in five birdies in a bogeyless round that
left him 4-under par for the day and 12 under for a tournament in
which no other player came within three strokes of par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played beautifully all day and it was just one of those
great weeks,'' Woods said. ``To play as solidly as I did all week,
it's just hard to put into words and describe the emotions that are
going through me - especially coming up 18. It was just
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Ernie Els and Miguel Angel Jimenez shared second
place, Jimenez closing with a 71 and Els a 72 to finish tied at
3-over-par 287. But Woods' biggest rival on Sunday was history.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped to the first tee with a 10-stroke lead over Els,
Jimenez, Jose Maria Olazabel and Padraig Harrington and never gave
them or anyone else a hint of a chance, winning by the greatest
margin in the history of major championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome to watch,'' said Els, who played in the final
pairing with Woods and was at a loss to describe the quality of
Woods' round. ``Just a dominating performance. That's also an
understatement - whatever I say is going to be an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominating was just one of the adjectives Woods' beleaguered
opposition used to describe the play of a man who joined an
Open-record list that includes such golf legends as Walter Hagen,
Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus,
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty phenomenal,'' said John Huston, the PGA Tour 72-
hole record-holder who finished fourth at 288 after a final-round
70. ``He's certainly out there in a league of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing a different game from the rest of us,'' said
Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, who defeated Woods in the WGC
match play championship but finished 39 strokes behind him at the
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, twice a PGA Player of the Year in the 1990s, opted
for the historical reflection:
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt for the longest time that someone was going to
come along who could drive the ball 300 yards and putt like (Ben)
Crenshaw,'' said the 43-year-old Price. ``Well, this guy drives the
ball better than anyone I've ever seen and putts better than
Crenshaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting, leading to 20 birdies - second-best ever by an Open
champion - carried Woods this week. But he also excelled at the
shots that set up his putts - ranking first in greens in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   What little trouble he faced Sunday he escaped with a poise and
deftness that might have seemed beyond his years but for the fact
Woods is now - at age 24 - three-quarters of the way toward a
career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Masters by a record 12 strokes in 1997, added a PGA
Championship last summer and can complete the slam next month by
winning the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won three - three different ones!'' said Els, 30, who has
won two U.S. Opens. ``Man, that's unbelievable. That's what you
want. You want those four. That's my goal ... but with Tiger Woods
to contend with, I've got a pretty tough job ahead of me for the
next 10 years at least.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the young guys,'' said Price. ``Basically
I've had my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had the latest of his four stellar Open days Sunday and
was flawless early. He hit his first three fairways and greens,
narrowly missing birdie putts on each hole. He parred from fairway
rough on No. 4, then showed his perseverance on the 513-yard, par-5
sixth, saving par with a six-foot putt after hitting out of rough
on both sides of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger really hasn't missed any putts this week, or very, very
few,'' said Tom Watson, who won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in
1982. ``That's the key, but to get into position where he's making
those 5-footers, 8-footers, 10-footers like he did at No. 6, he's
had to get there from some pretty awkward lies. And he's been doing
a great job of that all week.''
</P>
<P>
   He was doing it again just a few holes later, hacking out of
thick fairway rough to within a foot of the flagstick on No. 13 to
set up his third birdie in four holes - following 15- and 18-foot
birdie putts on 10 and 12, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But marvelous as he was dodging disaster, Woods was more
tactician than troubleshooter Sunday, as he demonstrated on the
573-yard, par-5 14th -laying up and than lobbing a wedge shot to
within eight feet for a birdie that got him to 4 under for the back
nine and the round.
</P>
<P>
   One hole later, he was combination mowing and putting machine -
hacking out of the hay again to barely reaching the green from
right-side fairway rough and then nearly draining a 30-foot birdie
putt that stopped on the lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant business,'' I'll tell you that,'' said Els. ``He was
never in any trouble - any kind of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   What looked like trouble for Woods on 16 and 17 merely produced
pars, first on a chip from out of the rough and following 15-foot
putt, then a bunker shot that he almost holed.
</P>
<P>
   With a 15-stroke lead on the 18th tee, Woods further
demonstrated his focus, eschewing trying to reach the par-5 green
in two for a shot at the outright tournament record. Instead, he
hit 4-iron off the tee, laid up on his second shot and wedged onto
the green for a two-putt par.
</P>
<P>
   All he wanted was the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible feeling to be our nation's Open champion,''
Woods said. ``It's just something that we all, as kids who play
golf and who want to aspire to become professionals, this is what
we look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what does Woods look forward to next?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to get better.''

EDITORIAL: TORTURED IDEAS ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration lawyers have proposed a strained new
interpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow
Washington to begin building missile defenses this year without
violating the treaty. The White House should reject their advice in
favor of a more straightforward approach, postponing any
construction decision until the serious technological and
diplomatic questions surrounding the current missile defense
program have been satisfactorily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   That approach was recommended to the White House last week by a
panel of national security experts, including a former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, former Defense
Secretary William Perry and former Sen. Sam Nunn. It would allow
the United States to make sure it was using the most reliable
defensive technology while doing minimal harm to arms control.
</P>
<P>
   America and Russia have long agreed that it would violate the
ABM treaty to pour concrete for missile-tracking radars the treaty
prohibits. But administration lawyers now claim that construction
could proceed well beyond this agreed threshold without violating
the agreement. Moscow would surely reject this interpretation, just
as Washington rightly rejected Russian attempts to create similar
loopholes for building prohibited radars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ABM treaty, there is another compelling reason to
defer a decision about building a missile shield until at least
next year. Several leading missile scientists contend that the
defensive system now being tested by the Pentagon may not be able
to distinguish between decoys and an actual incoming nuclear
warhead. That is a disabling flaw, for an antimissile system is
useless if it hunts decoys instead of warheads after both kinds of
devices are released by a missile in mid-flight. At the least, a
series of further tests must be conducted against the kind of
sophisticated decoys a rogue attacker could easily employ. Instead,
the Pentagon plans just one more test, using unrealistically simple
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should step back and consider other possible designs
for defensive systems that might avoid such decoy problems. One
alternative would build on the proposal made earlier this month by
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. The Putin plan, still more of a
concept than a set of specific proposals, would be designed to
intercept enemy missiles soon after launching in the so-called
``boost phase.''
</P>
<P>
   An ascending missile is a larger, slower and hotter target than
warheads tumbling through space, and cannot easily be protected
with decoys. A system based on the Putin approach would also have
the advantage of being already acceptable to Moscow and hence
easily accommodated within arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   A number of practical problems would have to be resolved. No
system like Putin's has yet been developed or tested. Even if the
technology worked, Washington would not want to rely on a system of
interceptors based mainly on Russian territory, as the Putin plan
envisions. Additional interceptors could be based on American ships
off North Korea and in the Persian Gulf. But these might be
vulnerable to air or submarine attack.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a boost-phase system may do more to enhance American
security than the Pentagon's seriously troubled program. The
administration should not prematurely foreclose that option or the
possibility of working out amendments to the ABM treaty with
Moscow. Instead of trying to finesse missile defense choices with
lawyerly language, Clinton should find the political courage to
postpone the decision until it can be more wisely made.

`THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN': PYTHONESQUE, BUT THE VULGARITY IS OUT OF
CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By NEIL GENZLINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can someone please explain how the British can get so worked up
about genetically altered food yet be perfectly at home with
genetically altered comedy? Because ``The League of Gentlemen,''
the series from the BBC that makes its U.S. debut Monday night on
Comedy Central, is nothing if not genetically altered. It is comedy
far more outlandish, far more deranged than nature ever intended
comedy to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The League of Gentlemen,'' which first appeared on the BBC in
1999, is an amalgam of sketches, sight gags, running jokes and plot
lines that almost defies description. Attempting it is like trying
to convey to someone living in two dimensions what
three-dimensional existence feels like. Two dimensions in this case
is ``Frasier,'' ``Friends'' and every other mainstream U.S. comedy.
Remove the taste barriers and the strictures of the sitcom format _
the tidy half-hour plots, the setup-zinger-laugh writing _ and
you're in the realm of ``The League of Gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, puts you in very strange, often offensive
territory. More specifically, it puts you in Royston Vasey, a
fictional town in northern England where pets die strange deaths
and humans who make the mistake of entering a certain local shop
are rarely seen again. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece
Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson created the show, and the first three
men play dozens of characters in it, often in dresses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sort of mock-horror soap opera, and, like a soap opera,
it may be difficult for viewers who miss the first episode to
figure out what's going on. Not that there is anything so normal as
a continuous plot; sometimes the sketches and scenes are related to
one another, sometimes they're not. The problem for the
late-arriving viewer will be more in the nature of getting a bead
on the assorted wackos. Someone tuning in ``Seinfeld'' for the
first time might pigeonhole George, Jerry, Elaine and Kramer with
rough accuracy after about 15 minutes. But in Royston Vasey there
are scores of characters, and all of them make Kramer look
downright normal.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of U.S. viewers won't get any of this. And plenty will
find it in very bad taste. There is bathroom humor, animal abuse
humor, humor at the expense of the homeless and the mentally
impaired. And those bothered by the sight of a woman (played by a
man) nursing a pig _ yes, that's right; nursing a pig _ need not
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strangers you would bring would not understand us, our
customs, our local ways,'' the woman's husband tells two
unfortunate highway construction workers during this scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I'll say,'' a segment of the United States will respond.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The League of Gentleen'' is not frat house humor, or even
``South Park.'' The show is regularly compared to Monty Python, and
it has a Pythonesque intelligence running through it, even if the
vulgarity does sometimes get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, once the shock of the material has worn off, in the
end, what impresses about ``The League of Gentlemen'' is that the
characters _ more than 60 of them, the publicity packet claims _
are distinct, vivid, each crazy or appalling in his or her own way.
The contrast with the U.S. prime-time sitcom, with its
interchangeable collection of self-absorbed teen-agers and young
professionals, is dismaying.
</P>
<P>
   Even if much of what goes on in Royston Vasey would never make
network television, there's a lesson here for America's moribund
sitcom universe. Not all humor emanates from Cosby-type families;
not all casts must be six characters or fewer; not all comedic
scripts have to be written in two concurrent plot lines that
intersect and resolve at the end of the half-hour. There is, as Rod
Serling taught us, another dimension.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: DEATH PENALTY TROUBLES IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   The case of Gary Graham, a convicted killer scheduled for
execution by lethal injection in Texas on Thursday, is a troubling
saga of the nation's justice system gone badly awry. Now, two
decades after the shooting for which Graham was condemned, this
case poses a test of moral leadership for Gov. George W. Bush. It
should challenge his unwavering faith in his state's administration
of the death penalty, which has produced a rate of execution that
is by far the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   These basic facts are indisputable. Graham, who was just 17 at
the time of the shooting, was convicted based solely on the
testimony of a single eyewitness, Bernadine Skillern, who saw the
assailant's face only fleetingly at night through her car
windshield, from a distance of 30 to 40 feet. Graham was
represented by a famously lackadaisical defense attorney named
Ronald Mock. Mock put on virtually no defense. He failed to alert
the jury to the flawed police lineup that may have biased
Skillern's recollection, or to the ballistics evidence showing that
the gun found on Graham when he was arrested was not the gun used
in the crime. Nor did Mock present two other witnesses who say they
saw the assailant, and that it was not Graham.
</P>
<P>
   This is a shocking example of how inadequate legal
representation sends poor people to death row, where some are no
doubt wrongly executed. Shoddy lawyering also contributes to the
extremely high reversal rate in capital cases documented in a new
study of death penalty appeals by Prof. James Liebman of Columbia
Law School. In Texas, as an investigation by The Chicago Tribune
showed last week, inept legal defense work is a particularly acute
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in a nod to the new politics of the death
penalty, Bush postponed the execution of an inmate named Ricky
Nolen McGinn to allow DNA testing that could bear on his guilt or
innocence. In the Graham case, there is no biological evidence to
test, but the argument for a reprieve is at least as strong. Thanks
to poor legal representation, and the impact of new state and
federal laws designed to speed executions by truncating the appeals
process, Graham has never gotten a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
   It may be argued that Bush has no power to grant a reprieve, or
postponement of the execution, since Texas law permits only one
gubernatorial reprieve, and Graham received one from Gov. Ann
Richards in 1993. However, it is not clear that the law precludes a
second reprieve from a different governor. In any event, nothing
prevents Bush from exercising leadership by urging the state's
board of pardons to slow things down and conduct the careful review
of the evidence that the courts failed to provide.

IN AN ARENA, SHATTERING STEREOTYPES OF RAP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A giant skull with red lasers shooting out of
its eyes slowly descended from the top of the stage until it
hovered over the audience of 20,000 people at Arrowhead Pond here
on Friday night. Its bone-white teeth clattered open and shut, as
an evil laugh reverberated through the arena. Then flash pots
exploded, the sounds of a thunderstorm pealed through the air and _
who emerged onstage? Was it Metallica? Iron Maiden? No, it was Dr.
Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   The era of arena rap is upon us. Last week what may be the
slickest, largest-scale, most professional and most punctual rap
tour to date kicked off in California. Full of spectacular light
displays, elaborate sets and expensive short films, it had all the
pomp and eye candy of a Pink Floyd concert. Billed as the Up in
Smoke tour, it featured, besides Dr. Dre and Snoop, Ice Cube,
Eminem and an extremely brief reunion by NWA, the pioneering
gangsta rap band that included Dre and Cube.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle was a far cry from typical hip-hop shows, at which
performers often appear onstage hours late and then proceed to
spend more time giving instructions to their DJs than actually
rapping. Also weaved into the show were Xzibit, Warren G., Nate
Dogg, Kurupt, Tha Eastsidaz and the Westside Connection. (The tour
comes to the Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on July
15.)
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour show was a slap in the face to hip-hop detractors.
For one, it let the air out of the notion that because hip-hop is a
studio medium, it doesn't translate onto the stage unless the act
includes a live band. None of the headliners on this tour had live
instruments or even dancers. They just used DJs, combined with
strong performances and lavish production, which was enough to keep
the audience riveted and on its feet for the entire show. In the
case of Dre and Snoop, this meant a 90-minute set crammed with hits
stretching back to the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also blew away the notion that the hip-hop audience is
fickle, and that careers are impossible to sustain. Most current
rock stars would love to have the longevity of Dr. Dre and Ice
Cube, who began putting West Coast hip-hop on the map with NWA in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Dr. Dre's resurrection has been one of the most
impressive in contemporary music. In 1996 his career ground to a
halt when he left the violence-torn Death Row label he helped
start, repudiated the gangsta lifestyle in favor of positive
messages and started his own record company, Aftermath. But last
year he came back with his negativity guns blazing, putting out one
strong single after another, chewing out his fans for abandoning
him while he was in the lab inventing hot new gangsta beats for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Radio at the time had seemingly surpassed Dre's laid-back,
driving West Coast sound in favor of more minimal, sophisticated
and rhythmically adventurous beats. But Dre turned back the clock,
and now, on the West Coast at least, his music dominates urban
radio, through his own singles and his collaborations with Eminem,
Snoop and the other members of NWA.
</P>
<P>
   A short film shown before his performance glorified all the
gangsta cliches of luxury living and merciless killing that just
won't go out of style. Onstage these headliners were a perfect
team: Ice Cube was a masterful performer, Snoop had a winning
persona, Eminem held his own as a dizzying rhymer, and Dr. Dre just
stood there, proudly representing his beats.
</P>
<P>
   Between acts an MC kept the crowd entertained, at one point
leading a cheer rarely heard at a hip-hop show: ``All the
Caucasians in the house, make some noise!'' The audience was a mix
of ages and races, which seemed to clash only slightly, as when
groups of black teen-agers scoffed, ``Eminem fans'' at passing
white concertgoers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday night at least the tour avoided another hip-hop
stereotype: that the shows are dangerous to attend. A spokesman for
the Anaheim police said there were only a few arrests, mostly for
disorderly conduct and drug possession, par for any arena show. The
performers, on the other hand, have not been so well behaved. On
the road for less than a week, two of them, Snoop Dogg and Nate
Dogg, have already run afoul of the law (for marijuana and domestic
violence charges, respectively).

IN THESE FINALS, VETERANS KNOW THE DRILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thirty-four-year-old Reggie Miller, keyed up for
his long-awaited NBA Finals debut, misses 15 of 16 shots for the
Indiana Pacers in the Lakers' series-opening victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six-year-old Ron Harper and 33-year-old Glen Rice, coolly
picking up slack for the injured Kobe Bryant, set their 2000
playoff highs with 21 points apiece in the Lakers' second win.
</P>
<P>
   Miller shows he's settling in, evoking memories of postseason
masterpieces past, scoring 33 as the Pacers break through.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Bryant puts on a fearless, brilliant shooting
performance in the pivotal overtime game.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant slips, Miller soars and outsmarts the Lakers again as the
Pacers stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   The ups and downs of the very (by pro basketball standards) old
and very (by anybody's standards) young have been a theme running
quietly through these NBA Finals. The series might be colored gray
and green as easily as gold and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk has been about the first championship chase of
Bryant and 28-year-old Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers. But just as
important is the work of the eight Pacers and six Lakers who are 30
and older, including three on each team who are 35 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of each set of starters is 33. It's hard to
imagine another NBA Finals with as many old-timers. On the other
hand, it's hard to imagine an NBA Finals without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many players coming out (of college early), the league
is getting a lot younger, of course. So you're going to get young
players in (key) positions at times,'' said Sam Perkins, the
soon-to-retire Pacers sub who sank a 3-pointer to force overtime on
his 39th birthday Wednesday. ``You may have one or two this year in
the finals because of their talent or the team they're on, but you
won't see a collection of 20-year-olds in any finals because they
don't have the experience and don't know what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, talk of an NBA generation gap was in vogue, as
the veteran core got down on the 20-year-old corps for failing to
respect the game or whatever it was they were supposed to be
respecting.
</P>
<P>
   That talk has died down. One theory is that the 1998-99
players-owners dispute taught the talent the value of sticking
together across generational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the young guys took the criticism to
heart, and another is that everybody learned there's more to gain
on the court by blending the brashness of youth and the measured
guile of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Where would Harper be without Bryant? Where would Bryant be
without Harper?
</P>
<P>
   Harper is the !ital!thirtysomething!off! who is acquitting
himself most surprisingly in the playoffs, carving paths to the
basket past younger, quicker defenders with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron came in (to the NBA in 1986 with Cleveland) as a very
offensive-minded player. It's maturity,'' assistant coach Jim
Cleamons said Sunday before the Lakers' practice on the eve of Game
6 in a series they lead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young and a high flyer, you're driving and
attacking the basket. Now, look at how he gets to the basket
through knowledge and transition. He's probably doing more for his
team to help them win than when he was putting up high numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron's not going to beat you on speed anymore. So he's taking
his little cracks through the lane, or in transition, to get to the
basket. When we have the floor spaced, if they don't stop (him),
he's able to get to the basket. You think, 'Is he ever going to get
there?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys at the end of their careers !ital!should!off! understand
the game better. They may not be as talented physically, but
through maturity and wisdom and the amount of games they've played,
they know how to play. So it's wonderful to see them rewarded at
this point of their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter Friday in Indianapolis, with the
Lakers down by 19 but still thinking about a comeback, Miller went
up for a 3-point shot and flicked a foot at 25-year-old Derek
Fisher, cleverly drawing a foul that Fisher compounded with a
technical foul for arguing. Miller's four free throws were the
final nails in the Pacers' 120-87 victory. It was an example of old
taking advantage of young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience pays off,'' said A.C. Green, at 36 the senior
Laker. ``That's really the moral of the story. You want to have
people who have been there before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a difference between the veterans, team to team. Being in
the league for 10 years doesn't necessarily mean they've been
!ital!here!off!, in the Finals pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' veterans are notable for their NBA Finals
experience. Green (with the Lakers in the '80s), Harper (Chicago),
John Salley (Detroit and Chicago) and Robert Horry (Houston) have
won championships. The Pacers' veterans are stigmatized by their
postseason failures. The only Pacer with a championship ring is Zan
Tabak, the just-turned-30-year-old from Croatia who averaged 0.8
points a playoff game for Houston in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Six Pacers players are going into free-agent summers, and coach
Larry Bird has expressed his intention to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this team, it creates a little bit more of a sense of
urgency, because you don't know what the personnel will be next
year,'' said Austin Croshere, one of the potential free agents even
though, at 25, he's one of the younger Pacers. ``It's kind of 'Make
the most of the moment, because you don't know if this
opportunity's going to be here again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, for all intents and purposes, the last run.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Pacers veterans have five NBA Finals tip-offs under
their experience belt, so the age-vs.-experience battle is
anybody's game. Anyway, assuming you have a little gray in your
temples, you'll still have something to cheer about if it comes
down to a Miller-Bryant shootout and the Lakers lose.
